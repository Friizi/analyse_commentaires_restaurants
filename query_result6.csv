Outstanding meat  I ve been there twice  and I ordered the small flank steak plate both times  I wish I could say I m going to branch out in the future  but it s so flavorful that I can t make that promise  The small portion is definitely enough for dinner if you have a moderate appetite  To round out the meal  order an appetizer  I ve had the jamon plate with goat cheese  delicious   the roasted corn  delicious   and the fungos  The mushroom portion was a bit scant for     but they tasted great in combination with the meat   I definitely recommend stocking up on sauces while you wait for your food   the ajo is my favorite  Beware that there is essentially no very little seating at the restaurant  If you can snag a table outside that s great  otherwise there is just a little counter space inside   My one complaint is that there were a ton of flies on the patio area the first evening I was there  They were gross and distracted from the experience   but the food was good enough that I went back a second time within two weeks  BYOB ,5,2014-08-31
The food here is delicious and fairly priced  You can also have a sit down meal in less than an hour which is rare  Get the rosemary braised beef sandwich and load up on the sauces ,5,2018-09-11
It is hard for me to write this because I really wanted to enjoy this place  We ordered the ribeye  mixed veggies  the mixed plate of meat  and brussels sprouts  It cost about      The food came promptly and we dug in  only to find all of the meat cold  Not warm  cold as if it had been laying around for an hour  We were starving after having driven   hours from Allentown  so we just ate it anyway  It did taste pretty good  We told the busboy about the coldness when he asked  and he offered a free dessert  but as I am diabetic  I said no  So  I would have given this place maybe   or   stars  but then I got sick  Not food poisoning level sick  but bloated  gassy  and indigestion all day  A bit nauseous as well  I have a stomach of steel  too  I almost never get sick from food   Just know that this place isn t all that it is cracked up to be  even the cuts of strip steak had tons of fat and the veggies were unevenly cooked  And  if your food is cold  get your money back and run  We probably just had a fluke of a meal but still   ,2,2015-10-13
My new fav restaurant  Not for everyone  though   The only seating is a ledge around the outside of the small room   There are a few stools    The food is incredible   Rosemary beef sandwich    Yum    Chorizo    Tasty    Greens  very good   I really did start to crave more the next day     I only regret I didn t bring any beer for the staff   ,5,2015-03-08
Be prepared for a little tiny space  The staff is vey friendly and helpful  The food is very good  We brought our own bottle of wine and they supplied some wine glasses  A lot of fun ,4,2015-02-06
Several friends recommended Gaucho so i decided to check things out for my self    The first thing that caught my attention was the wood smoke aroma     theres some seating along the walls   With Additional seating outside   So I ordered a steak carna sandwich  and it was frigging amazing    The bread had the perfect texture  Not too heavy  kinda springy     The steak had been perfectly cooked  and had great smoked flavor  That wasn t overpowering   Overall great balance of smokey and spicy   If you plan to come around noon during the week   be prepared to wait as the line might be out the door   Yes   the wait is a slight inconvenience    But well worth the wait     if ya want to avoid the lunch rush I suggest   comming  around       or closer to    ,4,2013-07-27
Yes  Finally  I got to take someone here  I do not know why but whenever anyone visits this is my go to suggestion AND yet people sometimes say no because of the wait  Let me tell you each and every minute I wait is worth it  My aunt and uncle were in town for the baseball game  btw we won  and I suggested we go here  We were already in the Strip District so they said ok  We walked in and they were just wide eyed gaping at the menu not knowing what to try or where to even start  They kept on saying  wow it smell good  There was no wait  miracle   and we got a table right in front  I got us each of the dips and sat waiting for our food to come and them to be amazed    Accompa amientos  Maiz  Grilled Corn on the Cob  It was amazing as usual  I talked my aunt into getting one with me  She bit into it just saying  wow   that is good  It was sweet and grilled to perfection  Each time I get this corn there is nothing that I would add to it at all  My aunt added one of the sauces  or maybe a bit of all the sauces  to hers and really seemed to enjoy that mixture    Peque os  Provoletta  Sharp provolone grilled with arugula  lemon  and olives on toast   I did not order this my aunt did for her main course  She said that it was almost too much cheese  if that is even a real complaint  but it was grilled to perfection  She also realized after this dish that she like arugula  It looked good  It was a nice thick slab of cheese on their toasted bread  i loved the look of it and would love to try it on another visit    Con pan  Pescado Fish of the day w  lettuces  lemon  and caramelized onion   This is my jam  I get this all the time even though I always want to try new things  It is just so good  The onions are just perfection  Smokey and soft with the hint of the grill in them  The tilapia just grilled so that it flakes off in your mouth but stays together in the sandwich  The lettuce is abundant and so when things fall off the sandwich you also have a little side salad to go with it  The bread is just the best  Light and crusty    yummmmm  I would eat this everyday    Exclusivos  Cerdo  Pork tenderloin  caramelized onion  and spicy mustard  Served with a small casa salad and tostado  At the last minute after much back and forth my uncle decided on the LARGE plate of the cerdo  It was a mountain of pork  He got it and when he looked at the plate just goes  maybe I should have gone with the small  He said the meat was great and the side of spicy mustard was just the right kick to make the plate amazing  He really loved it    I always enjoy showing and bringing people to some of my favorite places around the  burg  I love it even more when the people love the places we get to try  I am so happy they had a great time and can not wait to go back ,5,2016-06-25
BYOB  No cork charge  Definitely a bonus  food is very delicious and staff is very friendly and fun ,5,2016-06-06
I m pretty much just piling on at this point  but everything you read about this place is true  It s ridiculously good  The filet was the most tender steak I ever had  My wife and I split everything  we also got a flank steak sandwich which was very good  and some empanadas which were also tasty  The sauces are king here  my favorite was the Ajo  garlic  but they are all good  Be prepared to wait  but it s BYOB so just drink outside while you wait ,4,2018-06-16
My boyfriend and I were walking past and couldn t ignore the delicious smell coming from the open front door  Everything was delicious and the folks here are  friendly   If you don t know what to get they re happy to recommend something  You could tell they all share a real sense of pride in the place and why not  The restaurant looks great and the sandwiches are killer ,5,2013-03-12
Delicious steak and chicken dishes  I don t recall what we order but they were both really good  Chill atmosphere  Good for a hangout and a nice easy date,5,2018-09-01
Really good steak try the steak burger    Sauces are incredible and the price is good ,4,2014-04-25
I m impressed with the smoked wood aroma that ultimately made us turn back in our tracks to go see what this place had to offer   You step in and immediately you re in clear view of the grill with the wonderful   tasty creations going on right before your eyes   Staff is knowledgeable and explained the menu quite well as this was our first time here    Our order was taken promptly and we headed out to the quaint patio to choose our table as the place was quickly getting busy  They offer a delectable choice of sauces to complement the main entr e  The garlic was by far my favorite  Although  each sauce added a certain flair to every bite of steak  We ordered a regular size order of the skirt steak  the portions were more than plenty  A side of rice   and a roasted corn completed our meal  Presentation was great  They used wooden oblong plates that added a certain element to the dish   Our order was brought out to our table surprisingly fast   The skirt steak was tender  juicy and seasoned just right and served with a fresh baby greens salad and a slice of buttery toast  The roasted corn was tasty  The yellow saffron rice was good  The empanadas were okay  Overall   the food was delectable and I will be back to try the rest of the menu offerings   I m giving it four stars due to the fact that they didn t have a bathroom for patrons    ,4,2014-08-20
Great place for any time of day  We got the meat sampler and were not disappointed  The only thing that wasn t that great was the empanada  kind of lacked flavor  If not for that would of gotten    Also it s a BRB,4,2017-12-20
Was very good  but not excellent  The price for my NY Strip was great and the portion was okay  but the cut was very chewy and a bit tough  especially for medium rare  Their in house sauces were excellent and the service was very nice  Will be back to try some other items  Oh try the side of mushrooms  delish ,3,2016-11-30
Wow  I love Gaucho  I ve only been here twice but I crave it constantly  My coworkers and I have ordered from here and it s ridiculous because it s so much food during the middle of the day  But we can t help ourselves    We ve all only have gotten sandwiches and salads  The bread is out of this world  Tasty  soft and crunchy at the same time  How is that possible   and the meat is literally cooked perfectly  It tastes so good  as well  It tastes exactly like it should    This is a hard review for me to write because it s hard to explain how great the food here tastes  It s just really high quality and no BS  Definitely will be coming here as much as I can  Please do yourself a favor and visit when you can ,5,2018-08-22
Best place in pittsburgh   Tons of variety  Went here when it first opened and didn t have the expansion it has now  With the extra room this place will be an extremely popular place to get food  The steak  chorizo  lamb are all outstanding  Sandwiches are equally as amazing and make a great lunch option  If one can eat here  it is optimal  but I have taken out from here quite a bit and the quality is still excellent  Hours are limited during weekdays to   pm so get there early ,5,2015-07-08
Gaucho is Pittsburgh s best restaurant  The sandwiches are incredible and reasonably priced  They have incredibly fresh ingredients and I have honestly never had a bad experience  The paella is delicious  even having had it homemade before from a true paella master from Spain  The steak platter  asado platter  is also incredible and is   different cuts of meat  The sides such as potatoes  rice  etc  are all also delicious pairings with the larger dishes    My only negative experience at Gaucho came from the waiting process  The restaurant is extremely successful and after their expansion only became more popular  So popular  that most nights the line extends out the door onto the sidewalk outside  This wouldn t be a problem  except that it s poorly executed and often ends in frustration for several people standing in line  On top of that  what appeared to be an owner of manager addressed the crowd of willing  paying customers in a somewhat aggravated manner  It s obviously busy and people are confused  The last thing we want is to be yelled at by the staff before we have even ordered    Other than the poorly executed waiting process  and slight confusion between employees and customers  Gaucho is a special place  It has surpassed my other favorite restaurants as of late ,5,2016-12-30
I have a new favorite place to eat   Order the Rosemary Braised Beef  You won t be disappointed ,5,2016-09-14
The steak plate is always my favorite      And I can t remember which dessert I had but it was absolutely astounding ,5,2017-07-14
I love Gaucho   I go whenever I want something special  The wait in line is worth it ,5,2016-06-02
I finally had an opportunity to visit Gaucho  during one of my frequent work trips to Pittsburgh and I m happy that I did     OMG   The wait was long on a Wednesday night  so I can just imagine the weekend   I waited for at least    minutes  starting at approx        When I finally reached the front of the line  I had changed my mind about what I was going to order at least    times    lol   I decided on the ribeye plate w      order of shrimp and grilled mushrooms   I was then escorted to my table by one of the porters  and the second wait began  at least       minutes  but the food was absolutely worth the wait   The steak was accompanied by the mixed gaucho salad which included caramelized onions and strips of carrots  in a house dressing  delicious   There was also a slice of grilled ciabatta bread for dipping in those beautiful  housemade sauces   I thought that my favorite would be the chimichurri  which I enjoyed  but my favorite was the garlic  also tried the onion and red pepper sauces   The sauces were the perfect compliment to the entire meal   The ribeye was cooked perfectly  between medium and medium well  just the right amount of fat  which I usually don t like  but in this instance  kept the meat  moist and juicy   The shrimp were perfect as well   Shout out to the cashier  who helped me in choosing the desired  doneness  for both   The entire staff was a bit laid back  in a good way  super nice and very helpful    On the way out  I ordered the apple pecan bread pudding  which required  another  wait  approx    minutes  but it s baked to order  so I won t complain  and after tasting  I absolutely had no complaints      I will ABSOLUTELY return ,5,2016-11-17
What a wonderful and delicious evening   The entire event  designed especially for Valentine in the Bodega  downstairs dining room   was well planned  executed  and a total success   Each dish of the four course meal was perfectly prepared and served   Despite the  family style dining among    strangers  the experience was enriching   We all left with new friends   We enjoyed meeting our dining partners and felt warmly welcomed by our lovely hostesses   Thank you for a wonderful evening    know tomorrow night s edition will go just as well ,5,2018-02-14
This is still one of my absolute favorite Pittsburgh restaurants  even after my going fully vegetarian a few years back   Given that     of the menu is steak related  I think that s a testament to the quality of all the food   They have a wood fired veggie sandwich that still makes me weep happy tears  and they have an always tasty veggie empanada of the day  as well as a daily meat focused one    In addition  there are several side dishes that are vegetarian and excellent  including scrumptious salads  potatoes  and veggies     I m sure other reviews have mentioned how crowded it is  because the word is out about the ridiculous deliciousness of Gaucho  Most of the time you will be waiting in a long line spiraling outside the door   I ts still worth it   They seem to move people inside and seat people at a good pace   I tend to go right when they open for lunch when the line isn t too bad  and plan to heed the advice of others and call in a take out order to avoid the wait   Heavenly food ,5,2016-12-28
Came here with a group of    and had a great experience  They were able to seat us immediately after we ordered even though we had a huge party on a Friday at   pm  I got the sirloin steak cooked at medium rare and we got the paella to share  Everything was absolutely delicious  Love the sauces   especially the ajo  Definitely will be coming back here ,5,2018-03-02
I still love this place  They moved to a bigger spot with more room and more seating but the food still tastes amazing ,5,2017-05-31
Do yourself a favor and get down to Gaucho   Everything on the menu is amazing  I highly recommend the wings they are phenomenal    ,5,2016-07-06
So this was my first time here   it was a little different   when you first walk in there s a huge chalkboard with the entire menu of what they have to offer  Once you make your choice you can go to the cashier and place your order and they ll give you your drinks  You then proceed to another line  with drinks in hand  where you wait to be seated  When your food is ready they ll deliver it to your table and at that point you re on your own  If you want to order anything additional you have to go through the whole process all over again  For example  we thought about getting a dessert and were deterred because we didn t have the time  Outside of that the food was excellent  Everything was fresh and cooked well ,4,2018-02-15
I am a little confused as to why there are so many over the top excellent reviews for this restaurant   This was my first visit today and I absolutely had to try it when so many people gave it a five star review   It definitely is a hip  cool restaurant for the Pittsburgh scene and maybe that is what is clouding people s judgment   The sandwiches were good but definitely not spectacular   I has the pulled chicken which was more like pieces of chicken breast meat  definitely not pulled  which was a disappointment   The Provoletta appetizer was o k  but basically just melted cheese on top of toast  really nothing overly special   The sauces that are provided for free were good but  again  nothing outstanding     It was very pricey with a lunch for two costing       Also  we grabbed the only two remaining seats in the place which were bar stools crammed in the hallway between the kitchen area and upstairs dining area   Underneath the stools is stacked wood which makes this seating area awkward   There is no place to stick your legs while eating so sitting sideways is somewhat mandatory   Plus  my husband bummed his knees a couple of times off of the wood   I m not sure who s idea this was but they maybe should have rethought it     I am glad that I went for the experience but won t be back ,3,2015-07-01
Amazing  There is really nothing I can say about this place that hasn t already been said  All I can do is agree with every single wonderful life changing sentiment  It s really that good  It must be owned by magical unicorns ,5,2014-08-23
Incredible Flavor  Girlfriend and I had to stop in after seeing all the great reviews and it s all so true  The steak is extremely flavorful and tender  skirt steak sandwich   The best steak sandwich I can ever remember having  Great chimichurri sauce to  Girlfriend had the shrimp which was very fresh and you could taste the grilling which I find really nice  We also tried for apps the grilled vegetables and chorizo sausage  Everything was excellent  We will be back very very soon  ,5,2014-01-11
Love this place every time  Casual dining  Great  friendly service  All the food is delicious  Amazing lamb and fish  Always get dessert no matter how full you are  Try all the sauces on everything ,5,2017-02-01
Yesterday a friend texted   Want to try Gaucho s   I ll go anywhere and my hubs said people have been talkin  about this place so unbeknownst to what I was getting myself into  I agreed   This place does not take any reservations  For that fact alone  I wanted to go at  pm  Especially because it was Saturday  I said to my friend   Only crazy people go to a good place during dinner time on a Saturday   Well   we turned into those crazy people  Not necessarily on purpose  but as the events of the evening unfolded  our party of   became THOSE PEOPLE who went to Gaucho s on a Saturday night  At  pm ish  And we wind up arriving to find a massive line around the block   I have not stood in any line like this EVER in Pittsburgh  Correction   I have   just once   for preschool sign up   but even still I was done with that in    minutes  This line  We waited in it for   hour and    minutes  just to order   In the rain  I mean we arrived  I saw this line  and I said to my friends   What the hell have you gotten me into   I had not researched this place  I did not see it s insanely long list of positive Yelp reviews  I felt like I was back in high school waiting for concert tickets  Fortunately  I wasn t yet hungry so I didn t care   With all those details  long line  long wait  rain  etc    I feel strongly there is no one other than me that had the highest of expectations for this meal  Did it deliver  Absolutely  And in exciting news  even though the wait was painful   the food was delivered fast after we were seated  For the delicious food  I would give this location   stars  If there s no wait   read this review as   stars and then go  But for the insanely painful wait and the wish that they could figure out some better solution so no one has to wait   hours  That s why I subtracted a star  I mean  the way this location is set up  if you re waiting  you can see the people inside eating  And you re like   feet away from them  While we were in this   hour line  I saw a man inside take   minutes to eat his last bite of salad  Everyone else in this party of   was done eating and this one person WOULD NOT STOP TALKING and just HAD to finish the last bite of salad on his plate  Fine  But you know what  When people are standing outside in the rain  waiting to eat  we re giving you death stares from the window thinking   STOP TALKING  TAKE YOUR DAMN BITE  and be on your way     The fact that any restaurant could entice this kind of emotion or thought process is why I subtracted a star  I mean   our party of   had a fun experience but sometimes you don t want an  experience    sometimes you just want to eat a delicious meal    So here s the summary    star food   star employees No reservations   so plan your time and hunger accordingly BYOB   don t forget a bottle opener FYI on those nights when the wait is insane  most people start drinking in the line     one poor party of   ahead of us DROPPED THEIR BOTTLE OF WINE   it was terribly sad  Don t leave the butterfingers in your group in charge of the only thing that will keep you sane while you subject yourself to the weather and hunger games  And if you so decide to be those crazy people who go on a Saturday night like us at dinner time  bring LOTS of BYOB but do yourself a favor  don t forget some plastic cups and or class it up by have your pregame prepared with SOMETHING in a travel coffee mug  I can t even remotely condone public drinking   I would actually be scared to open beer or wine while in line  we waited until we were inside  but I regretted not having something in hand for   hours   Oh yeah   and that peanut butter bread pudding dessert  JUST SAY YES,4,2018-02-25
It s awesome   Great service  great taste  great smell  and great atmosphere   You must try   The indoor space is limited  and the restaurant is very popular  so try to arrive there      am if you want to have lunch there on weekend   I love the shrimps and salmon  today s fish   Sandwich and salad are also good  There are a lot I want to try  so I will go there again definitely  Do not forget to get some sauce on the table  It fit all meat ,5,2014-04-19
Really loved Gaucho  Came with friends on a sunny day  The wait was about an hour  which is usual for this place   so make sure you don t come starving  I got the flank steak plate which is served with salad  a slice of toast and sauce  The steak was cooked perfectly and was super flavorful  All four sauces are really good and complimented the steak  Also got a side of roasted cauliflower that was delicious and seasoned to perfection  I definitely recommend  Gaucho and cannot wait to go back and try more ,5,2018-08-04
I will preface this review by saying that I am an Ohio girl giving something in the Burgh   stars  On that fact alone  everyone should go   it is that good  And i you come here  you too will realize that there is no other rating you can give Gaucho s  From the smell alone when you walk in the door  you know you are about to have a good time    Upon entering in from the rain  we were greeted very warmly by almost everyone that worked there  As we were deciding what to order  they happily walked us through everything on the menu to help us make good selections since unfortunately  you can t actually eat everything on the menu    but you will want to   We got the skirt  the rib eye  the shrimp  mixed veggies  and corn   and every single thing was OUTSTANDING  I didn t realize that I hadn t taken the obligatory  food photo  until the plates were already empty  oops  sorry yelpers     Pro tip  you might be tempted to overlook it  but make sure to get an ear of corn  I know it sounds simple  but it is amazing   and you too will not believe you when they tell you there is no butter on it  It s also BYOB  but make sure you bring some to share ,5,2014-05-12
Went for a Sat  family lunch  and Gaucho surpassed our high expectations  based on all the glowing reviews here  The  small  steak plates    with salad   grilled bread    are a great value  and our   y o  devoured hers like a tiger  Mom loved her ribeye  and my hanger steak sandwich with roasted red peppers was perfect   We split sides of patatas bravas   yellow rice  ideal for mopping up the juices   Don t miss the salsas    ajo and chimichurri were our favorites  but the pepper and the onion were both tasty   distinctive  too   The staff were terrific  helpful with a dash of humor   and the snug indoor eating space  a handful of stools and some standing room  is fun if you re willing to be flexible   friendly   We ll bring a bottle of tinto to take advantage of the BYOB policy next time ,5,2014-12-27
Gaucho doesn t look like much when you walk by  but dont be fooled   This place is all about its wood fired grill and the aroma of burnt wood and food fills the air around the   th Street Bridge  Currently  they are a small place that does better for take out  They do vegan  vegetarian  gluten free and tons of meat selection for we carnivores  Put this place on you list to check out but dont expect to have a seat  Very limited seating     high tops chairs  They bought the neighboring building and will have much more seating by the end of the summer though  Definitely looking forward to seeing what Gaucho has to offer in the future   obsessed already with their wood fired cuisine ,5,2015-03-10
While this is not a formal dining experience it is a good one   Location very cool and food is very good    The Argentine flavors are excellent   Try the trio of sauces  If you are looking for something different give this place a try  Employees are extremely friendly ,4,2016-12-06
Amazing food  nice atmosphere  The line is long so be prepared to wait for an hour or so before ordering ,5,2017-06-28
Fantastic   The steak burger is one of the best sandwiches I ve ever eaten in my life   Perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned   The pork shoulder sandwich could use a bit more sauce on it  but luckily  they provide you with four delicious sauces to add   This is hands down the best restaurant I ve eaten at in the city so far    years  ,5,2015-08-27
The food is wonderful  A nice addition to the strip,5,2016-06-02
I was in Pittsburgh for business and visited Gaucho twice for dinner  despite the       minute wait to get it  The flavor here is incredible  If you have a problem with waiting in line  or you re that person that will endure but complain about the line to everyone waiting   don t kill the vibe and head down to McDonald s    You can see it from the line   Also  it s BYOB  So grab a bottle of wine on your way  Or two  one for dinner  one for the line ,5,2017-12-10
I was visiting Pittsburg for work and stumbled on this place  The line was outside the door but only took    minute to get to our table  I ordered a steak medium rare and it taste very good and was cooked to perfection  The service was friendly and prompt  I was with   others who were from California too and we all enjoyed our dishes   When in Pittsburg I will be visiting this place again ,5,2017-08-13
     worth the wait  and even better if you re smart and order ahead or come on off hours  It s so good  our downtown office orders ahead and  sends team members on the bus to go pick it up  My favorites are the chorizo sandwich and the provoletta  but all of their sandwiches are outstanding and a fantastic deal  Their sauce options enhance the whole experience and set this place head and shoulders above the rest ,5,2018-09-06
BYOB but not cash only  Amazing food  Known for the meats but don t skimp on the sides  either ,4,2017-06-22
Damn this place is so good   But those lines man  those lines   The meats  the flavors  the everything make it worth it   If you drive by and don t see the line out the door  then get out of your car and go inside ,5,2016-05-11
Absolutely love the food at Gaucho  everything was excellent  The decor and food is very nostalgic of Argentina  However  to keep in line with the Latin way of dining and improve the overall experience  redesign is needed  Gaucho  in an attempt to reduce costs  with limited space and staffing requires customers wait in line to order food  including dessert  then be seated  The wait is often very long  making it not ideal for the elderly or disabled or those of us that want to sit down with a glass of wine and enjoy a scrumptious meal without standing in line ,5,2018-07-28
This was our second time being there and we wanted to get deeper into the menu and give it one more chance so we ordered steak  chicken  sausage  salads  fried cheese etc    to be honest I should have just went to wholeys and bought food to  cook at home  The food at Gaucho  especially for the price was lack luster  the meat came out semi warm with nothing but burnt cold sour dough bread slices as a topper  Let me just state that I have been to Argentina a few times and the food there makes gaucho look like a McDonald s  anyways the meats did not have any distinct flavors that would separate then from any other   star restaurant but the spicey chorizo sausage was the only good item we had  The portion size is almost about right  the presentation is acceptable which can sometimes make up for the lack of cooking skills the chiefs have  Everyone that works there is a brain washed hipster with dreads or long slick backed hair  no one in the kitchen is from Argentina  You of course can go there are try it for yourself but I wouldn t recommend it  Nothing is special about the place  Some people think it s the greatest place on earth and that s because they most likely never been anywhere else ,2,2017-12-02
Again  FIVE STARS    Incredible filet  chimichurri sauce  red roasted potatoes  salad  grilled olive oil bread  all delicious and satisfying   Can t wait to come back again ,5,2016-11-26
Excellent flavors  and nice staff  I had the small New York steak  Bife de chorizo  and a couple of empanadas  The grilled meats are cooked to your taste  Make sure you get each of the four sauces and try them with your food  The place is Zagat rated  I found the prices very reasonable for quality food ,5,2018-03-21
This place was incredible    Definitely get the rosemary braised beef  especially if you like horseradish  and the surf and turf was great    The shrimp was cooked perfectly and flank steak was excellent  All four of their sauces went great with the meat and shrimp  I especially liked the chimichurri sauce  Really friendly staff and it s BYOB    Bring some extra beer  or whiskey  for the staff there and they will treat you right    Overall  great experience and I will definitely coming back   ,5,2014-04-19
I don t know anyone who has been to Gaucho and not loved it   I m a vegetarian and big fan of cheese so I always go for their provolone sandwich   My boyfriend loves meat and he is crazy about their steak sandwiches   The only problem is that there are only a few tables inside to eat at   Best to go on a weeknight or get it to go   So worth it though  ,5,2016-10-30
Really great restaurant     Unusual set up   you wait in line to view the menu  order your drinks at one counter  then order your food at another counter  then they seat you  and they call your name when your food is ready but deliver it to your table   Steaks were melt in your mouth good   Highly recommend the Garlic   Rosemary Shrimp too   Atmosphere was kind of hipster    way too clean to be considered a dive   Really good dinner choice for my husband  our     year old daughter  and myself during a short visit to Pittsburgh ,5,2018-09-28
Best new place in Pgh   The aroma of the wood fired grill will lead you down the strip and into this friendly place   The food is simply amazing ,5,2013-05-17
I ve heard so much hype about this place that I was half expecting it to fall short of my expectations but it blew me away   I got the steak burger with a side of veggies    Great combo because you can add whatever veggies you like to the burger   Both were out of this world on their own though   The burger is also quite a meal so be prepared for a lot of food ,5,2015-05-31
Let me stress how tasty the braised beef is  I have yet to stop at the venue but I have had the finished product from here  AND LET ME TELL YOU     THESE GUYS KNOW THEIR TASTE BUDS  Not to mention they seem like they LOOOVE what they do too   Beef they cooked was tender and mixed with potatoes  horse radish and another key ingredient that I do not know  Any way the mix of sweet and spicy in a dish is something I had yet to experience to this extent    Also had shrimp with asparagus and rice which tasted very good  but did not measure up to colorful taste of the braised beef    Food seemed well put together and healthy    Cannot wait to visit their venue and indulge in all the colorful flavors they have ,5,2014-11-13
Service  everyone is nice and friendly  Awesome overall  Employees wear regular everyday clothes so a lot of times  I actually mistook an employee for a patron  Ha  Service is also fast and we didn t wait long to receive our food    Price  pretty expensive    Food  so good  Sauce is delicious and I love that it is self serve  I can grab as much as I need  Steak is a must    How to order  check out the menu while you re waiting in line and walk up to the counter to order  Go sit down  servers will bring you plates and utensils  Wait to hear your name be called and the server will bring your food to your table    Kids  I had my   year old daughter with me and immediately after sitting  an employee approached us with a book and a toy to keep my daughter entertained  Awesome    Will definitely be back ,5,2017-05-26
I had tried to go to Gaucho once before  but since the lines tend to be long I never made it to the door  Yesterday we had the chance to get there for an early dinner    and I must say  it was worth the wait  We ordered five different items to share and I don t know which was the best  The chicken Empanadas    for     were a nice start   we paired them with the dipping sauces available for a little extra flavor   The Provoletta was amazing  Perfectly cooked and was nice to share with this amount but isn t too heavy to have all to yourself  The corn mash  I forget the actual name  was possibly my favorite item   served warm  it was absolutely delicious  Then we shared a sliced beef plate that had good flavor and a nice medley of veggies   caramelized onions with it    Top that all off with the pineapple bread pudding and a nice bottle of red  BYOB  but NO CORKING FEE   while sitting outside was a perfect Tuesday   Everyone was friendly and helpful when we couldn t decide all the dishes we wanted   and the wait staff was fantastic  I ll definitely be back ,5,2016-05-11
Overpriced and overhyped  The ordering process is terrible  Stand in line for an hour to order then hope there s a table ready between then and when your food comes out  Steak sandwich was good  Shrimp were overlooked and overpriced      for     they should be large and delicious  they weren t  Salads had around   pieces of lettuce with    cent sides  Spent     for dinner for two with no sides or drinks and had to go to primantis after to fill up  If you must go because you ve heard so much hype like ourselves  stick to the sammiches ,2,2015-11-26
The steak burger was one of these meals i have ever had    BYOB and get ready to eat good  Great service too ,5,2018-09-28
Gaucho s new and expanded space is awesome   It s really great to be able to enjoy this incredible food without feeling super cramped  Plus  the BYOB aspect is much more appealing now that they are open for dinners and you can really settle into your own table   All of their food is absolutely fantastic   After coming back from a backpacking trip to South America  I still thought Gaucho s food was amazing   My favorite item to get for the value is their Steakburger  which is really just a giant smoked burger with two of your choices of fixins  cheese is a little extra  I think   It s a big burger and will satisfy even the hungriest of us eaters  If you re looking to splurge and love steak  you cannot go wrong with one of their platters   I want to mention two more highlights of Gaucho  They recently added wings to the appetizer section  and DAMN are they good   They are cooked on a wood fired grill like much of the rest of the menu  then tossed in some kind of magically delicious hot pepper oil and scallion sauce  with grilled lemons on the side   If you haven t tried them yet  go and get some   Finally    their sauces  Oh my gosh their sauces are DELICIOUS  And they are self serve  so try them all and then load up on your favorite one ,5,2016-04-04
Hands down  best sandwich I have ever had   Carne Sandwich with Skirt Steak is my go to   Perfectly cooked steak on fluffy ciabatta that soaks up all of the goodness   Topped with caramelized onions and roasted red peppers   The staff is always friendly  no matter how busy it is    and man can it be busy on the weekends   Call ahead to order and you dont have to wait in the long line   The owner is very cool  gave me a beer once  its BYOB but he had a growler of some East End Big Hop   which was awesome     Plus  they have dog bones for a buck that my dog goes absolutely crazy for    sorta like I do for the sammie   Get there    it is worth it ,5,2014-05-31
My friend Rachel C brought me to Gaucho on my recent Pittsburgh trip and it was a total riot  The guys who work there are hilarious and super flirty   hanging out while we waited for our food was so much fun   We both opted for steak sandwiches with chimichurri and caramelized onions  The sandwich was delicious and very filling  We also ordered sides of the roasted potatoes and vegetables  which were great    We managed to hit Gaucho on the final day before they closed for renovations  Wishing them the best and looking forward to checking out the updates next time I m in Pittsburgh ,5,2015-04-27
Gaucho Parrilla has become one of my favorites in Pittsburgh  It s  th in the nation on Yelp s list for best restaurants in the US and definitely deserves its place there    I went with a friend and even though the bus dropped us across the bridge  the stop is right BEFORE the bridge  but he just kept going     it was totally worth a freezing walk across an icy bridge to get to this place  The person who took our order was super knowledgable about the menu and I can tell they take a lot of care in preparing the food  He even offered to let us stand by the wood burning stove since we were so cold from our walk over    We got the Rosemary Braised Beef sandwich and New York steak  as well as a side of potatoes  It was all delicious  I think the sauces they offer really make it awesome    As many have said  the hours that they hold are a bit inconvenient   Tues  to Sat        AM  to       PM  Sunday Closed  Monday Closed  There have been many times I wanted to go  but it was already closed  Hopefully they will expand their hours after they renovate  At any rate  if you live in Pittsburgh  and eat meat   you should definitely check this place out ,5,2015-03-14
This meat is to die for   We only had to wait about        minutes on a Friday around  pm and our food came to us within another       minutes   I love that there is no corkage fee   We shared the mixta with NY strip  chicken  and chorizo  all great   We also had the Carne sandwich w  filet and carmelized onions  which was also the best steak sandwich I ve ever had   Seriously   GO NOW ,5,2015-11-25
How long has this place been hiding in plain sight in the Strip District    I had just crossed over the   th St bridge and bam  There it was  The line was to the door  so I walked around a bit before coming back around      on a Wednesday  Very small line at that time   The menu is a bit huge and overwhelming  but I decided pretty quickly on the Carne sandwich  What I was not prepared for was the cashier then asking me to choose between a whole list of meat cuts  I selected the filet  and I m glad I did    This steak was tremendous  It made me question why I only eat steak     times per year  It made me question my whole life  Cooked medium  it was like biting through soft butter  Excellent feel  excellent flavor  The bread had the right amount of interior softness and exterior crunch  and I m always a fan of caramelized onions  next time I ll probably ask for extra   The sandwich also came with one lone  small pepper right in the middle  and some sauce   Get to the Strip and eat a sandwich that s not Primanti s ,5,2016-06-17
Unlike the other reviews we were very lucky and had no wait  The food was fantastic   Thank goodness the staff was extremely helpful in what to order because the menu was a little tough to choose from with a line of people behind you   I suggest checking the menu before you arrive and have some order while you grab a table ,5,2015-07-20
The steaks are great  the sauces are a      and the atmosphere is awesome  The line does get long though  so plan ahead  get there early or order takeout to avoid a long line  ,4,2018-05-17
I was in town visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and yelped a bunch of places  and of course  Gaucho popped up with its   star rating   Pros  I did really like the ribeye sandwich  After reading many Yelp reviews about it  I decided it was worth a try    Cons  Everything else was pretty mediocre  We got the grilled veggie plate  side order of potatoes  rosemary braised beef sandwich  NY strip plate and the fish of the day plate  The rosemary braised beef sandwich was nothing compared to the ribeye sandwich  The potatotes and grilled veggies were soaked in oil  as was most of the food  There was so much char on most of the meat  and it wasn t anything special anyway  The fish was good  but nothing spectacular  There was a huge long line and we had to wait about    minutes until we actually got to eat    Overall  I came to Gaucho with high hopes  but left pretty disappointed  Don t get me wrong  the food is not terribly BAD  but it s not worth the hype  I m surprised that this place has a   star rating  is this the best Pittsburgh has to offer ,3,2015-07-23
This restaurant has excellent beef items  If friends visit Pittsburgh and are looking to visit the Strip district and want a casual meat restaurant this is the place to go  They are cooked to perfection  The drawbacks are parking as well as having to wait in line  which at times can be long ,4,2018-07-28
Awesome sandwich  I recommend the sandwiches over the plates  I got the carne and it was absolutely delicious ,5,2015-01-09
Delicious although the wait outside can be very long  Very casual and not obviously the place for your first date,5,2018-10-27
Amazing   Safe to say this is the best lunch I ve ever had  I got a perfectly cooked steak sandwich  Try it with the sauces  Large portion and great price too  I can t wait until I m back in town to eat there again ,5,2014-08-20
This place is delicious  I went on a Wednesday night around   and the line was maybe    people long  not bad    I would avoid peak hours on weekends so your wait isn t too long   I had a flank steak sandwich and potatoes  It was SOOOO good  The sandwich can get a little messy  If you want steak but don t want a mess  I would suggest just ordering the steak  It comes with toast and a side    Everyone at our table loved their food  No complaints   The workers are great  Everyone is very friendly and helpful    BYOB ,5,2016-06-17
Holy Hell Pittsburgh  Drop everything you re doing and get down to this place  Doesn t matter how long a line  it is worth any wait  Been eating here since it opened and has never never ceased to amaze  satiate and delight  I mean  how can a place make a slice of grilled bread taste so good  Like that you think about it and crave it and can t believe you are eating it  But they do  To say nothing of the steak  Have gone through a fair portion of the menu but can t beat the steaks served any way you want them  A crown jewel for Pittsburgh dining  Holds its own with anyplace I ve eaten in any city including San Francisco etc where I lived for    years  Just amazing ,5,2017-07-15
I wanted to be much more impressed with this place  It just didn t live up to the hype  We figured the long lines meant great food but left feeling like we missed something   all the reviews said the food was super tasty and flavorful but I found it to be bland  I mean  I do have unique tastebuds since I m from the Caribbean  but I felt like I could make better food at home ,2,2018-08-20
Dementiel as we said in French   Everything in this place is perfect  the atmosphere of course  the decoration  the staff and last but not least the food  Burger delicioso  chicken  chorizo  pork even the quality of the vinaigrette can be spotted ,5,2015-11-28
Gaucho is as good as it gets  The only problem with Gaucho is that it s too popular  and the wait can be ridiculous  I recommend going on a weekday at odd times like  pm if possible to avoid having to wait at all    If it your first time at gaucho  I strongly recommend getting the Asado platter  The Asado platter contains   pieces each of   different types of steak  It s      but it has enough food to feed     people  so not too pricey when you split it  Get it medium rare  Trust me  the way they cook their steak  it s meant to be cooked medium rare  Try the steak by itself and then with their four dipping sauces just to get the whole experience    Even though they re an Argentinian steak place  their vegetable dishes are amazing  I m not much of a vegetable person  but every salad or vegetable dish I ve gotten there blows me away  If you re with     friends  I recommend getting the Asado platter and a large salad and another vegetable dish  It comes out to around         per person    There s no other place more worth it that Gaucho  Nothing in Pittsburgh compares  If you re trying to impress your friends who are visiting  this is the place to take them ,5,2017-10-24
If you are willing to wait for a while  you will not be disappointed   The food is really good and you get a great amount for the price   I recommend the pork sandwich with onions and spicy mustard   Great atmosphere and the staff were friendly and helpful   Would go back for sure ,4,2016-09-03
Firstly the smell is mouth watering just like their food  Choice of meat  how it s cooked  variety  vegetarians can find food here  I had the carne and it was full of flavor  Thick bread so I pulled some of it out  Will be back for sure ,4,2018-05-18
What a wonderful place to catch in the strip district  When in Pittsburgh this is a must have stop  You will always hear the typical if having the Pittsburgh staple Primanti sandwich but this is also one heavy delicious sandwich  I had the ribeye sandwich with grilled corn and it was the best steak sandwich I ve ever had  The employees there are also wonderful  Very friendly and fun atmosphere  It is a small location but if you can catch a seat outside then I would recommend  to do so ,5,2014-09-03
This was our first time traveling to Pittsburgh and this was the one restaurant we wanted to try  At first the menu is overwhelming  but the staff came around and offered assistance to help us with our order  There were   of us  so we ordered the Asado Plate to split  It is   cuts of beef  filet mignon  skirt  NY strip  flank and ribeye  cooked to your desired temp  We also ordered the Papas Cuna  which is potato salad  and an order of the mixed vegetables  The food was amazing  This was by far our favorite restaurant that we ate at while in town  Highly recommend going here  Note  they don t serve alcohol  so bring your own wine or beer with you ,5,2015-07-15
I always got the sandwiches  I never knew what I was missing until I started ordering off of the entr e menu  That s not to say that the sandwiches are lesser than  but the entr es are so fantastic it s really hard to pass them up  Yes the large size steak on trees and some of the bigger entr es are a little pricey  but the quality of food and preparation totally justifies the price  I m not a huge meat eater  but this place offers incredible slices of red meat and the chicken is fantastic   Totally worth the splurge  The flank steak is to die for  the chicken breast with the garlic sauce all over it is on real  The sides are good  the cauliflower and the broccolini are definitely the best  the potatoes are good but in contrast to the awesome flavors in the meats the potatoes seemed a little lackluster to me  They re supposed to be a sidenote the main show     I ve never ordered the paella  but I ve seen it served and it is a ton of food with lots of yummy things  There s really nothing better than a perfectly cooked cut of meat   It s worth noting that even though this place definitely is carnivorous  their salads are some of the best in the city with or without meat and all of their non meat offerings are done right ,5,2017-12-07
Wow  awesome  Just go  Food is incredible for carnivores and omnivores alike  Staff helps guide through the menu as you wait in a line  that is there for very good reason  ,5,2018-04-25
Fantastic  and a fun dining experience  the slam the counter seating to the self services sauces and silverware make this place a must do when in the burg ,5,2018-09-13
Gaucho  a vegan s paradise  Just kidding   If you re not craving a lump of meat that s been resting on a hot grill for several minutes  then you should probably head on over to your local farmer s market or graze the grass in your neighbor s backyard   But if you find happiness in ripping apart dead animal flesh with a fork and knife  dipping it into variety of native south american dipping sauces    flavors to choose from   and sloppily mashing it in between your teeth while beads of sweat drip off your face into the puddle beneath you  then wait no longer   Request that uber  jack a few bottles from your roommate s prized craft beer collection  and call up that cool chick who s down to guzzle some brews  munch on medium rare cow  and crack a few dick jokes   Now that we ve filtered out the gentle  ethical souls from the carnivorous  protein fueled  ruthless beasts  let s get to the nitty gritty with how gaucho works   If you venture down to the strip district on   th and Penn on a Friday or Saturday night  you ll be waiting outside the door for       minutes   The crowd you ll be cuddling with for warmth if you make the trip between November and March will be in the age range of       and will be wearing an assortment of high end peacoats and Nordstrom bought dresses and high heels   Once inside  you make a quick scan of the menu which includes the Vaca section   what cut from the dead cow you look to ingest  sandwich section   what type of dead animal you d like to be placed on your french bagguete  or the salad section   I m not sure what this entails but I m guessing there will be greens  cheese  fruit  and oils all mixed together   as salad is an after thought at this Argentinian meat house   You order at the counter  wait to get seated  sit  eat  guzzle your drinks  byob  and leave   It s loud  crowded  and everyone s drunk  but the food is still the focal point here   Nobody can ignore the high quality meat and flavor which actually comes at a fair price    oz sirloin for    bucks    The waitstaff was friendly and they all seem like cool people         would go back ,4,2016-02-07
Amazing steak sandwiches  Loved the atmosphere  Very clean and the service was great  I highly recommend to anyone in the mood for a tasty meat sandwich,5,2019-07-25
Super   All food is great  Little crazy with ordering first then they sit you  but great food and atmosphere ,5,2018-12-22
Stopped here for lunch after a long morning  shopping at the Strip   Let me start off by saying the food is pretty darn good  It is inventive and full of flavors  They also have an area of a few homemade sauces  chimichurri  Etc  along the side that you can go get  The bathroom is clean and spacious  though theres only   single person bathrooms  which draw a line quickly when the restaurant fills up  But to me it just wasn t enough to overcome the lackluster experience   First  the menu is huge and written on the wall in chalk  Well  if there s anyone behind you  you have no time to crane your neck enough to be able to pick something that sounds like it would be okay   Then you are given all your drinks up front  while paying and tipping at the register  I didn t know that  So my boyfriend left to get a table and set our bags down  and I was left juggling drinks and my purse and a few shopping bags up the stairs to the dining area  Our food was brought to us  a plus  But  we didn t know how to get a drink refill  do we go back up to the register  Is there a waiter  We were so confused  So we waited and waited and someone came and asked if we wanted refills  and took at least    minutes to bring them back  I am guessing because the restaurant was pretty full and they were also taking food orders out   I also can appreciate quality food and ingredients  but I did think the prices were a bit high on some items  I got the Large melted provolone appetizer for the table  but it came out as   small slices of bread with cheese on it  which we had to cut into pieces to feed all of us  The side of broccolini was   long florets and a couple green onions  I just didn t get it  to be honest  The rosemary beef sandwich was pretty excellent but was too dry without some kind of condiment so I used the homemade chimichurri to dip it in and it definitely elevated the sandwich a bit    Maybe its something I need to get used to  I just didn t realize it was that kind of place from the reviews and from the exterior interior look and feel of the establishment   I might give it a shot again    maybe ,3,2017-10-24
On my way to Pittsburgh one of the places that I was really looking forward to was Gaucho  We came here on a Saturday  standing in the line with a    pack as the smell of their wood fired grill was taking over the whole street  Apparently there is always a line here  We waited for    minutes  and yes it is worth it   As I was standing in the line  I couldn t help myself not hearing how locals exalt this place  I ordered their filet sandwich and the rosemary braised beef sandwich  for to go   The winner was the filet  but with a small difference  The first bite that I took from my filet sandwich  was overwhelmingly tasty  The meat was cooked to perfection  and the roasted peppers in the sandwich had this unbelievable smoky flavor which added a lot to the sandwich  The sandwiches here are served on ciabatta which makes them even more delicious    As far as the appetizers go here  we got the Caldo del Mar  seafood soup  and the Papas Cuna  potato salad    Both were truly mouth watering and tasty  The Papas Cuna is a must  Probably one of the best potato salad I ve ever had  I have no idea how can a potato salad taste so rich and creamy    The service here is relatively fast  and the staff here are very friendly  You order at the register  and sit yourself and they bring it to you  The atmosphere inside is trendy  and pretty cool  But  again I don t think it s necessarily for me to talk more about the atmosphere  Who goes there for the atmosphere  I wish we had Gaucho in the Bay Area ,5,2015-09-13
The food here is delicious  but the last couple times I have been here it seems like the size of the sandwich is continually decreasing  I usually get the rosemary beef  and when I first started eating here the sandwich was almost twice the size it is now  I m not sure it s worth what they charge any more  very disappointing ,2,2015-10-02
Amazing food   super friendly staff  The first time I stopped in  I was surprised at how affordable it was   I ve only dined inside so far   it s been perfect   comfy  clean  pleasant atmosphere  Can t wait to visit again in the warmer weather to try out their outdoor dining ,5,2019-02-18
I ll admit I was skeptical  is this place  really  that good  Um  yup  And they re not pretentious about it  Go early  tho  Even though the line moves quickly  it gets insanely long ,5,2018-02-09
Absolutely incredible  Efficiently run restaurant with an incredible menu  I had the blue marlin pescado sandwich with the cheesy toast and roasted potatoes  which were all amazing  Would definitely recommend  well be back ,5,2018-01-07
This is a unsung gem in Pittsburgh   While the set up is a bit unconventional the food is great  When you come in you stand in a line and order off a wall sized chalkboard menu then pay  They then seat you after you order  It s a byob location  The food is so unique and delicious  Give this place a try ,4,2017-05-23
It tastes as good as it smells when you walk by   Had the cerdo  roast pulled pork   which was amazing   The cut of meat  execution of the smoking  and mild rosemary flavor were all top shelf   Cookies were good too   Be sure to load up on the free dipping sauces  as they are also amazing   This deserves to be the highest rated restaurant in Pittsburgh on Yelp  guess this region has better tastes than Ann Arbor  M   ,5,2016-11-19
Come visit if you re in Pittsburgh  Wanted to give a     stars  but they don t have an option for that unfortunately  This is some honest to goodness Argentinian food that will satiate the meat cravings that everybody has once in a while   We ordered the asado plate  a sampler of all the meats for      along with   empanadas       one of the beef and one of the vegetarian kind  You get a    or    oz total of NY strip  flank  sirloin  ribeye  and filet mignon  we asked for medium rare  but some of the pieces were cooked a bit more well done   no complaints here     You can dip the meats in   different sauces  the chimichurri sauce is honestly the best  along with a couple loaves of bread that is little bit too burnt for my liking  The empanadas were great  especially the beef empanada  but the vegetarian one is somewhat bland and may have needed some more flavoring   Overall  a great experience and good place to bring a date  I recommend you come early to avoid a line  we went at around          PM on a weekday ,5,2019-07-08
Probably one of my favorite restaurants anywhere  To say the food is great would be an understatement  Everything is fresh and full of flavor  If you havent been here  go  Its easy to see why theres always a line around the block to get into the place  but once you do  you wont be disappointed,5,2017-04-16
I m not really sure of all the hype about this place  Went for lunch with a few co workers a few weeks ago  There was probably   people in front of us in line and it took about    minutes to order  Not super slow  but alright  The menu has a nice variety  but I could tell people had trouble deciphering it  I ordered the flank steak platter and proceeding to find a place to sit  The only seats available were these strange  low benches  Nobody wants to eat on something like that  let s be honest  Anyway  it took us a long time to get our food  We were waiting at least    minutes  My friend who ordered first  a chicken sandwich  ended up getting her food about    minutes after the rest of us and we were almost done by then     minutes for a chicken sandwich at lunchtime is ridiculous  Overall  I liked my food  It was tasty and I enjoyed the sauces  My friends chicken sandwich was on bread that completely black  She said it was pretty bland and she found a few bones  My other friend got a fish sandwich and complained it didn t have much flavor   Overall  I think it s a little pricey for what you get and over hyped ,3,2015-07-15
I thought the food was excellent   The meats were cooked to perfection we ordered one of the steak dishes and the rosemary braised beef sandwich which was huge  I wish i ordered a whole bowl of the salad   I been dreaming of this salad since I got back from my trip  All of the condiments were amazing     The people cooking the food were friendly and waiving to all the patrons   Why i took off two stars was because the person taking my order was rude   The girl who rang up my order rolled her eyes at me because we didn t finish our order in the time i m guessing she allotted for   Driving   hours and looking forward to eating this place as our first stop in the burgh I let one of the runners know that and how delicious it was and all i got was a stare and she didn t acknowledge anything i said   I guess we weren t hipster enough ,3,2015-08-18
The burger was delicious   Not your typical American hamburger   It s super flavorful  big  you can split with someone   and has a great crusty bread instead of a bun   Price is well worth it  but expect to wait in line since the restaurant is so popular ,5,2015-10-03
Instead of some lackluster happy hour  go to the state store  get a heavy Chilean Red and your whiskey of choice  and get your hangry ass to Gaucho before  pm on a weekday   If it s your first time  the front of house experience is a bit awkward  It s not bad  it s just weird  You order at the counter as a group  but can split your check  After that  you can order more from your table and get table service  Tip well and be loved  The entire staff splits tips  I wish they d just raise prices and wages  but we re just not there yet as a nation  One thing at a time   Look at the menu ahead of time and know what you want  For the love of god  don t keep Pittsburgh waiting outside for Gaucho because you were live tweeting the wait instead of thinking about what you wanted to eat  you heathen  Or Snapchatting  You were snapping  weren t you  On that note  this place is small  Please be considerate of those in line once you recover from the meat sweats    Open the wine  You can t go wrong here  but get the flank steak and carrots  The flank steak is impressive but the carrots are a spiritual experience  You can eat the large  but get the small because bread pudding  Get rare to medium or you re dead to me  Try all the sauces but you only need ajo  garlic sauce  for your toast  Finish the wine or give the rest to a table in need    Walk down to Leaf   Bean  open the whiskey  and revel in the privilege of a cool summer s eve in the city o  ahrn  If you don t know what you like  get a Leaf by Oscar with the Connecticut wrapper  Enjoy  but do not finish the whiskey  Get home safe ,4,2019-07-26
This is one of my absolute favorite places in the city to grab a bite to eat   Argentinian grilled meats are delicious no matter what the type  The sandwiches are unbelievable but sitting down and grabbing some of the entrees the menu offers is the move at this place  The flank steak here is to die for  and don t forget the chimichurri ,5,2019-09-23
Great food   Worth the wait   Staff is friendly and helpful   Well thought out  nice touch is the wine glasses for the BYOB customers  and NO CORKAGE FEE   I shall return ,5,2016-05-30
Popped in while looking for a quick bite  This place is simply amazing  Isabel was great in guiding us towards the beast meats and explained in detail the different cuts  We opted for flank steak with fungos and vegetables and we couldn t be more happy   Great meal  best in Pittsburgh so far ,5,2014-08-20
Honestly    worth the wait  My husband said the wait is the only thing he d take stars off for  but he hates waiting more than    mins for anything so    The warnings about the line are real   expect to wait at least       minutes  We came on Cinco de Mayo weekend by accident  and this area of Pittsburgh has a weekend market going on  anyways  so parking was rough and the line was already winding around the building  We still only waited a little over    minutes  though  so I d call that a win    The prices are fair  especially for the amount of food that you get  but it s my opinion that you should skip the platters and just go for the sandwiches  Would maybe change my mind if I got the asada platter or the paella  but those are things I d get only with a hungry group of friends  For just me  the steak sandwich   some empanadas are more than enough  Speaking of which  I want to shout out the empanadas    I ve never had Argentinian empanadas and was expecting the Mexican masa variety  but these are more of a bread dough and almost more like an Asian bao   Super good and wish we got more  at first  I was a little underwhelmed by how small they seemed  but with the bready dough and dense filling  they were the right amount of filling     Also  big ups to the sauces    all of them are great  but the standouts are the chimmichuri  obviously previously raved about  and the smoked pepper  Honestly would have taken more to go if I wasn t so worried about little sauce containers spilling in my car    Overall  great experience that genuinely feels local and warm  The service is great   efficient and used to dealing with crowds  love that they find your group tables so no one can hog reserve more space than necessary  and extremely friendly  Looking forward to coming back  hopefully with a shorter line  and trying more on the menu ,5,2018-05-14
Absolutely my favorite place to come to when I visit Pittsburgh  The flavors are amazing  you can t go wrong with any meal ,5,2017-03-23
I can t say enough about this place  I LIVE for empanadas and these are soooooooo good  The braised beef is    making me drool thinking about it now  Shrimp was perfect  And the house made chimichurri sauces are yum   This place is always busy  as it should be because it s awesome  Plan to be patient  And enjoy ,5,2019-07-27
Unbelievable food  I make an effort to stop here whenever I m in Pittsburgh  Delicious smoked meats and a great selection of authentic chimichuri  At lunch hours there is a line out the door so it is best to visit at an off lunch hour time ,5,2017-04-28
This is a hole in the wall in the strip district  the website photos are  shall we say  optimistic   But the food is delicious  So far the best I ve had in Pittsburgh  better than Salt  Spoon  Soba  Point Bruge  etc    High quality meats  good spices  and all really fresh  Probably not something to eat on a low sodium diet but delicious ,5,2013-12-02
Simply the best steak sandwich in pittsburgh  The meat is amazing and the staff friendly and helpful  The gentleman working the counter even offered to come around to explain all the chef s homemade sauces to us  I will be back again and again ,5,2014-02-01
OMG  What can I say   The food is awesome  We started off with the Provoletta  delicious   and then had the NY strip large plate and the Camarones  shrimp  large plate   Husband and I shared  and loved both meals  Each plate had buttery toasted bread and a leafy salad   The center table had   different sauces to choose   All were wonderful   Every bite of food is nicely seasoned   Wanted to try the potatoes but they had ran out and didn t know if they would be ready for the meal so we had to pass on them   We almost walked out because there are only several stools to sit on or you can stand at the small table in the center but the aroma kept us there   There were non stop people coming in too   But we honestly didn t wait all that long   The good news is they are renovating the bldg next door which is supposed to be the restaurant part and where they are currently is going to be just the kitchen ,5,2015-02-01
Wow  We weren t so happy to have to wait in the cold in order to get inside  but WOW was this worth the wait  We got the Asado Platter  the Parrillada Mixta  with spicy chorizo   and a small steak plate  because there wasn t already enough meat      along with the Papas al Horno and Roasted Spaghetti Squash  The food was phenomenal  The meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned  and the sides were a great complement to the meats  And it s BYOB without any fee  so you really can t complain about that   We had a few dietary restrictions in our group  no gluten  no dairy   but the staff was very knowledgeable and they were able to easily accommodate us   We will definitely be returning to enjoy more of the delicious food ,5,2018-12-30
Best pollo in town  Friendly staff  affordable price with amazing food    Dont miss to try out their house special sauces ,5,2019-02-10
My boyfriend and I went here last minute on a Saturday  If you plan ahead and go at non peak times  the line isn t too long and the food comes out relatively quickly  We had chicken  beef  and vegetable empanadas which were all fantastic  We also had   orders of tostado with all   different types of sauces  you can get any kind you want which is cool    I really loved this place and thought it was very authentic and super yummy  If you hate long lines  just plan ahead and you ll be fine  but I think it s worth the wait ,5,2018-09-09
Worth waiting  I had the seafood soup and corn pudding  and I try the gilled chicken from the bbq mixta  The chicken was so good  The others are good too  My don t eat beaf but my friend told me it s good  I have to say everything is better than what I had in Argentina      ,5,2015-08-29
This place is awesome    Best place for steaks in Pittsburgh  I got a filet mingon sandwich and it was done perfectly  The seasoning that they use on their meats is great  They use a lot of rosemary which adds a lot of flavor  I only wish that they were open later during the week and I wish that they were open on Sundays ,5,2014-11-07
This restaurant is such a great addition to the strip district  Their food is fresh and inexpensive  We enjoyed the grilled shrimp  salad  and filet  The BYOB is a plus and the atmosphere is fun  The staff was awesome and very helpful when figuring out what to order  Only down side was that the food wasn t hot ,4,2016-12-18
No matter what time of the day going here starts with a line  Yes the food is amazing  but the line especially if it rains or it is cold is annoying  sorry  The good thing is  when you get in the door the process of ordering and getting a table is quick  We had the Carne and the Rosemary Braised Beef Sandwich  both good but the Rosemary was my favorite  the bread is really good too  We also tried the Chorizos and Empanadas both flavorful and delicious  My absolute favorite comes last we had Nutella Breadpudding and Horchata Ricepudding if your a Dessert lover you have to have it ,4,2017-01-26
One the best restaurants this city has to offer  Made even better by the pleasant staff  Despite the crowds and he lines they are always super happy and helpful  The rosemary braised beef sandwhich is amazing,5,2017-05-12
I really have never been to a place like Gaucho  I was in town for the Steelers game and saw all of the glowing reviews on yelp  I felt compelled to comment on my experience  This was a regular lunch spot with high end meats  We do not have anything like this back here in Chicago   We waited maybe    minutes  which wasn t bad  This place was absolutely worth the wait  some guy told us the same thing walking out   We ordered the Asado Plate  which were all   cuts of the steaks they offered  It included Flank  NY strip  Ribeye  Filet    Sirloin  which were all incredible  My favorites were definitely the Ribeye and NY strip  The item on the menu  though  that made me feel compelled to write a review was the rack of lamb  I feel that if you add Lamb to your menu at any restaurant  you know what you are doing in prepping and preparing meats  This New Zealand Lamb was cooked perfectly and was the highlight of my trip  We also split a side of the veggies    Overall  I would have to say this was one of my top   lunchtime meals that I ve had in my life  Maybe  even  top   meals regardless of the time of day  No exaggeration  If you are in Pittsburgh you have to hit up this spot  I will be back next time I visit Pittsburgh ,5,2015-09-22
I mean  obviously this review is going to be five star like every other review  So yummy  I was visiting Pittsburgh and our Uber driver recommended this place  When I yelped restaurants later on  it ended up also coming up  Sunday we decided to go  but turned out to be closed  Decided to go next day  Monday  but was closed to  We were able to eat before we headed out of Pittsburgh on Tuesday and it did not disappoint  We sat outside and our dog was welcomed and given a cold drink as well  Staff is very nice ,5,2019-08-08
We went here for the first time for my husbands birthday this year  When we arrived we had already known there would be a wait  considering it s very popular and there s always a line  We waited about a hour and finally got up to order  We ordered the meat platter with all   types of steak  Our favorite part about trying the meats is to see which we like the best  and to compare  It was a little disappointing when the food finally came out  they had forgot to label each meat  The waiter that delivered it also didn t know which was which    so we just ate a big pile of meat lol  Made it a little fun trying to guess what each cut was   The food was EXCELLENT though regardless of not knowing what we were exactly eating  Will be returning again ,4,2019-02-07
This place has amazing steak  Good prices  excellent variety  Make sure to bring a nice bottle of wine with you  Will not be disappointed ,5,2018-04-13
Tiny restaurant on the corner at the far end of the Strip District  You can smell the delicious smoke from half a block away  When you walk in the  the staff is extremely friendly and give their advice on what to order  I went hungry and left extremely full with left overs  We ordered a side of potatoes because the empanada maker was sadly out of order and this was enough for both of us to share  I ordered the rosemary braised beef with caramelized onions and horseradish sauce and it came on a nice soft roll  I will say that I wish that there was a little more horseradish but I just know for next time what to ask for  My husband ordered the rib eye with peppers  onions and chimmi churri sauce on a hard roll and he loved it    If you re looking to go as a group or to sit down  just note that there are bar stools and small counters inside  They do have outdoor seating but depending on the weather  you may just want to take your food to go or back to your office   Thoroughly impressed and would highly recommend  The smells alone will get you to walk in   ,4,2014-04-16
So this place was good  don t get me wrong  The food came out well presented  and definitely tasty  but it was cold  I ordered a rib eye and it tasted like it had been left out on the counter for a few hours  After all the crazy raving reviews I had heard about this place  it definitely did not live up to expectations  We ordered a side of roasted red potatoes each and no one at the counter informed us that it was a larger helping that could definitely be shared  Needles to say  we didn t finish either  Bummed about this place for sure,3,2018-11-18
I came here because of all the good reviews but left the restaurant with disappointment  I ordered sirloin and lamb rack and both were extremely bitter to me because the meat and bread were burnt  The flavor was nothing special  and the sirloin was very chewy  Lamb had good texture  but the bitterness ruined everything  I don t even think it s safe to consume food that is burnt like this   Anyways  I probably would not come here again  I really don t understand why there are so many good reviews    ,2,2019-08-07
Sooooooo good  Service was great  Totally worth the wait  The best only bad thing  is that I now want one of those sandwiches like everyday  Haha,5,2017-03-05
This place has excellent steak and the smell is amazing   There can be a long wait  but it s worth it ,5,2018-11-14
My mouth is watering thinking about the time I ate here  There s a great selection of items on the menu  Only complaint is that they don t take reservations   and because this place is popular  it means long lines at times  But trust me  the food is worth it  Not only is the meat and food great  but so are the chimmis  free and unlimited   their homemade sauces   which you can actually purchase to bring home    Food     Parrillada Mix  NY Strip Steak  Grilled Chicken  and Chorizo with toast   Beans   Greens  onions  shallots  white beans  wilted greens  and grilled lemon   Eggplant  chilled and marinated grilled eggplants  poblanos  garlic  oregano  sherry vinegar,5,2019-01-11
Long wait for good food but not great  There are a lot of rules you have to follow too  I didn t like any of the sauces ,3,2018-09-02
Best food in Pittsburgh bar none  BYOB with no corkage fee is a nice added bonus   Whenever I have a visitor from out of town I make sure to bring them to Gaucho and they always love it  Waiting in line can be a little rough but give you the time to chitchat cause when the food comes out  it goes silent with people chowing down  Takeout is an option if you don t like waiting   My favorites from here    Chorizo  I wish I had known how delicious it was the first   or so times I ve visited     Carne  steak sandwich with grilled onions peppers ,5,2019-07-25
For the last few years  this place has been ridiculously good receiving all kinds of attention in the news and on social media  but more recently  I think the food quality has slipped a notch or two specifically at their restaurant   It seems like they have their best grill masters working their Asado wagon which frequents local microbreweries each week spring through fall   I want to give Gaucho five stars on here  but they are not currently there ,4,2019-08-13
Hands down one of the best restaurants in the  burgh   If you re looking for a fancy meal  this ain t it  but the food is unreal  Make sure to go at an off time   meaning  not at lunch time during the week or dinner on the weekend  or be prepared to wait ,5,2019-09-18
Beautiful food  Beautiful space  Wonderful service   Absolutely awesome concept  Argentinian meats sandwiches salads  We got the steak sandwich with flank  you get to chose your cut  for     and the rosemary beef brisket with horseradish     and roasted corn on the cob       Steak sandwich was impeccable  amazing bread  chimichurri  high quality meat with a char that I ll be drooling about for days and deliciously grilled veggies    Brisket sandwich was also tasty  my only complaint was that I wish there was about  x the amount of horseradish sauce  I was so into that sauce  y all    Corn on da cob was amazing  Grilled to perfection and served with the husk    HUGE portions as well   I loved my experience here  I will be rushing back ,5,2014-04-15
Updating my review of the newer  bigger space    Ample seating and review still holds true  Out of the   times I ve come  there was only   time I didn t have to wait but trust me  you ll be very much rewarded for your patience   The meat is perfectly cooked and stick to your guns  if you like rare go for it because they will get it perfect  Your veggies will be beautifully grilled and charred right to the point before it has that burnt taste  The   house made sauces will delight every part of your palate and try all   and see which one you like the best  The bread is always so crisp yet chewy   lightly brushed with olive oil  use it to soak up all the meat juice   I m getting hungry typing this but for all you people who can visit whenever  I envy you all  This is a must eat in Pittsburgh ,5,2016-06-23
Every  Single  Time  That s how often Gaucho is awesome  I work in the Strip District and I love eating meat  This means I eat there super often  And honestly  Every single time I do  it s amazing   Flavorful  perfectly cooked beef  Check  Amazing  succulent chicken  Check  Delicious and abundant sides  Check   It s always crowded but they have a nice seating area in the back now  they ve expanded  and they have an equally nice patio seating area during nice weather  Some might consider it expensive when compared to other lunch or dinner dining options in the area  there s a    delicious pho joint right down the street   but MAN do you get what you pay for    Go there  If the line is around the corner  which is often is  wait in it patiently  You will be rewarded with tasty meat treats ,5,2015-10-16
A lot of people had recommended Guacho to me  and it was definitely worth the hype  My girlfriend and split the parilladas mixta  an order of papas al horno and a small provoletta  It was a lot of food  and a very reasonable price for a nice date night dinner  I ll definitely be visiting again ,5,2019-12-03
Really bad experience  I got to the restaurant an hour before closing and the door was already locked  So if you are planning to go and have dinner make sure you arrive a few hours before  They should post it on their web  closing time is not accurate ,1,2018-07-06
Maybe the best food in Pittsburgh   So much flavor   You re paying for quality at this place  and you get it  every time     The salsas  probably not called that  are all amazing   If it wasn t socially inappropriate  I would put a straw in those pitchers and use that as a drink with my meal ,5,2017-10-21
You will be in HEAVEN after having a meal at Gaucho  There is always a wait out the door but the food is so worth it  The menu has so much to offer  at all reasonable prices  but you can never go wrong with anything you order  I ve been twice and both times enjoyed the steak sandwich  The meat is so flavorful it tastes great in any dish  They also offer a variety of sauces that are good to try  Try to come early to beat the crowds ,5,2018-04-24
The girlfriend and I have been wanting to go to Gaucho as soon as we found out about it from Yelp  We actually did try to go one time but as we pulled up the line was out the door and around the corner  We stood in line with some friends for about    minutes before we realized the line wasn t budging  Granted  we didn t stay in line that long  but we were very hungry and restaurant week was currently happening so we decided to go elsewhere  We recently went back and figure out why there is so much hype about Gaucho   The first tip I would give to you would be to be prepared to wait in line depending on the day time you go and the second tip would be to bring alcohol because it is BYOB  The second time we went we waited for about    minutes before being seated  The staff was very helpful and made sure everyone knew the wait times  they even told us that they were stopping taking orders since there were no tables to seat customers at the time  The way the restaurant works is very interesting  you decide what you want on the way to the cashier  gives you something to do while your waiting as well  and then you order and get shown to your seat by a host    We ended up ordering the some empanadas  cheesy bread  a chicken sandwich  and pulled pork sandwich  The food came out super quickly which was great because we were very hungry  They also offer a number of sauces which we tried in line and fell in love with the red pepper sauce  The empanadas were wonderful and tasted authentic and fresh as well as the cheesy bread which was surprisingly better than it sounded on the menu board  The sandwiches were huge and we ended up having to take them home but they were also amazing and stuffed with meats    I am looking forward to going back here and trying out the other wonderful things the menu had to offer ,5,2019-04-02
First of all  our taxi driver wasn t sure where this place was when we first gave him the address  And then when we finally got there  he looked at us and said   Well  there s people inside   We got out  looked around with some trepidation  as we re not city dwellers   shrugged our shoulders and decided to go for it  and I m so glad we did   The place just smelled amazing  and we were really hungry  I finally settled on a salad with rib eye steak  I would have liked less fat on the steak  but it was super flavorful and a perfect compliment to the salad  which had yummy roasted grilled veggies   We didn t realize that it was close to closing time  so they were running out of things like bread and sweet potatoes  which was bad for anyone who wanted a sandwich  I was impressed with how friendly the cashier guy was  even at the end of the day  He calmly and patiently explained the menu to newcomers  like us    There s hardly any seating  so we were lucky to grab some seats as people left   The kitchen is open  and they keep the wood piled up in the front area  so you can see them cooking making your food  I was thrilled to watch my salad being made oh so carefully by a very cute guy   We were the last patrons as they closed up for the day  They were kind enough to call a taxi for us  and when we left  the chef and his staff said thanks and goodbye as they stood outside smoking their cigarettes ,5,2014-04-17
Be prepared to wait   There are no reservations and the line is out the door on a Saturday night    We waited about two hours    I loved the food and there is a choice of small and big portions  so nice to not have too much food    I had a veggie sandwich and my hubby had a yummy steak    The potatoes and chimi sauce was great    Bring your own bottle and everyone does  You order in line and food is brought to you    Even seated  service is a little slow   But food was great and I would return   A fun place and very friendly staff ,4,2017-08-13
The food at gaucho was awesome     I had the Rosemary braised beef sandwich  which comes with caramelized onions and horseradish sauce  The meat was tender and flavorful  the onions were soft and sweet  the sauce added nice tang  and the bread was chewy on the outside and soft on the inside  I also split the grilled vegetables and the corn pudding as side dishes  The corn pudding was delicious  It was creamy  had great texture and spice  and was slightly smokey from the charred corn  The vegetables were my favorite part  hard to believe even for me  The platter came with red peppers  caramelized onions  zucchini  asparagus  and mushrooms  Each vegetable was grilled perfectly  seasoned extremely well  and had a delicious sauce  The peppers were also charred and had a wonderful smokey flavor  The sauces to choose from too also added unique flavor to everything we tried  The staff was friendly and accommodating in the great atmosphere the restaurant had to offer  However  the line was insanely long and it took almost    minutes to order  so I would either go early  go when you have a wide open schedule  or order ahead  Either way  it was well worth the wait  Definitely a place to try in the strip district of Pittsburgh ,5,2016-05-26
Mucho bueno   Great place for groups   Will be back many times again ,5,2016-01-12
One of my favorite spots in town  Gaucho never disappoints  The food is amazing and reasonably priced  well worth the wait in line  Bring a couple friends and order the Asado platter ,5,2018-12-09
Went here on a first date and couldn t have asked for a better experience  from food to servers to the wait line that wrapped around the building   this place left such warm memories  The food was fantastic  of course  The environment was lively and servers so personable  Thank you for a wonderful time ,5,2019-06-08
Hits and misses for sure at Gaucho Parrilla   We went for the Parrillada Mixta since we wanted to try a lot of things   Came with NY Strip steak  grilled chicken  and chorizo  as well as   pieces of toast   The steak was great  cooked perfectly   When you pair it with the chimmichurri  it s just perfect   There s actually   sauces  but in the end we both thought the chimmichurri was the best   The chorizo was also very good  but the chicken was a huge let down down   very dry and not much flavor    We also got an Argentino salad to share   The salad was great   Loved the grilled flavor on the veggies   The large on its own is definitely a filler  especially if you add protein to it   For some reason we didn t care for the empanadas   Both the chicken and the beef were just alright     Saw a bunch of people ordering sandwiches and it looked amazing   The toast we had was great so I can only assume the bread on the sandwiches are just as good   In hindsight  probably should ve went with that or just the steak haha   Be prepared to wait in line   Apparently we were lucky and only waited for       minutes ,3,2019-09-13
The place smells great but the prices are a bit steep and they arnt very helpful with the menu  All in all a pricey place woth good smells  I wouldnt recommend this establishment unless you already have an understanding of Argentinean cuisine ,2,2019-02-14
Just amazing food  It s delicious  the portions are huge  and the prices worth it  It s very small and cozy  the staff very Friendly and welcoming  with a hipster vibe  Definitely worth stopping by  Try anything on the menu  I d recommend one of the small streaked with a pequeno on the side  the Jamon Serrano was amazing ,5,2014-12-13
One of only a handful of  must try  restaurants in the Pitt   This place is tits ,5,2015-07-25
First time in Pittsburgh and this place was all everyone recommended  The food was excellent  service was excellent  prices were reasonable   It s a quick meal though  Dont go if your looking for a nice sit down dinner  Your in and out quite quickly ,5,2019-08-02
Yup I went there but it didn t fully live up to the hype  Food WAS good  line was out the door and around the block  always a good decision   atmosphere was a bit plain but ok  heads up it s a BYOB so be prepared and bing a cocktail   The empanadas where Soooo Good the best being the veggie one   as a devote meat guy you bring me a veggie anything that blows my mind it s worth talking about      I love the little guy niche  ABC    Anything But Chain  restaurants  Why   not    Lunch for   people with a desert but NO alcohol and one of us drank tap water was      A bit steep seem like steak house prices ,4,2019-08-09
For our last meal in Pittsburgh  we wanted to find somewhere good  After searching the Internet for quite some time  we came across gaucho and decided to give it a try  One of the best decisions food wise we made during the trip  although all food experience during this trip was top notch   We got the biggest meat plate with five different cuts and some sides like potatoes  asparagus  and squash  It was definitely a lot for two people but we still managed to finish most of it because it was so freaking delicious  Could not think of a better meal to end our trip  Additionally  look at the picture   The way they plate their food is so simple yet beautiful ,5,2019-10-13
Amazing food  One of the best restaurants I ve ever been to and well worth the wait in line  Get there early  It s byob  We ordered all the side vegetables and they did not disappoint  My favorite with the broccolini   Wow I can t wait to go back ,5,2018-05-05
Not real Argentinian steak  in Argentina steak is always cooked well done  but still very tasty  Usually crowded but lines move fast  Great service  Not much more to say ,4,2018-02-19
The food was amazing  Spent the four days in Pittsburgh for my birthday and this was the best spot by far  Meat cooked to perfection  It seemed like every ingredient was of the best quality  Definitely worth the price ,5,2019-05-25
Great place   Authentic food   Great menu   Right on the   th street bridge   NO PARKING so you have to hike a few blocks and prepare for parking meter hell coutesy of Pittsurgh parking authority   Go later in the evening and forget paying since there is no enforcement   Locals just wait until enforcement goes home for the evening   Food is the actual deal   For me  however  it is far too much per serving   Good see see a new business in that spot   Roy,4,2017-09-06
Showed up at      and waited    minutes without the line moving  They advertise they take phone orders   when you call no one answers  Good food  Horrible service  They needs to learn how to get people their food faster  I don t recommend ,1,2015-09-19
I dont know how I didn t rate this place before  This is one of my top   restaurants of all times  I m so happy we got to go  The line was about    deep outside the restaurant  We attempted to go one day but we didn t want to wait in the long line so we came earlier    and I m sooooo happy we did  The meat    the meat     omg    I cant even tell yall how perfectly cooked it was  Juicy  Seasoned so well  The wood burning grill makes the steaks sooooooooooooo good   Ive looked everywhere in DC  Maryland  TX    and pretty much all the places I visit to see if there is anything like this place and I can t find anywhere    I  think I even looked up Los Ang   and was  unable to find anywhere    I need to make this place apart of my regular eats    somehow    OWNERS   COME BUILD ONE in TX     Also  despite the    deep that I saw on my way out    I d wait in a line for this place ,5,2019-05-14
If you are ordering lunch get it Togo if possible  I didn t know either that while ordering a Togo order you do not have to stand in the long line that will be wrapped around the block  but it is sooo worth it  I recommend the ribeye  corn  shrimp and grilled veggies  Food is pricy but you get what you pay for  The steaks are always tender and packed with flavor  Spices are heavy and the chimichurri is delicious  I would recommend taking one of each sauces and using them all for dipping  You won t be disappointed ,5,2019-02-04
We traveled all the way from Houston and wanted to eat here for dinner  Despite our best efforts  we showed up right at  pm and the white haired older guy grumbled about letting me in  Then while I was ordering he came behind the counter and grumbled to the guy who was in the middle of taking my order   damn  it looks like we re going to have to stay until    again    Ok      I really like the concept of this place   We ordered the Parrillada Mixta  New York steak  chicken breast  spicy chorizo   This was the most lacking of all of the dishes  The meats were all cold and the chicken was dry but the flavors were good  Perhaps this is due to us showing up late   We also had the large grilled vegetables which were EXCELLENT and the Caldo Del Mar which was also EXCELLENT  It was steaming hot and definitely hit the spot   All the serve yourself accompanying sauces were pretty great too    I would have given this place   stars if the  older guy  didn t leave such a bad taste in my mouth  Everyone else was very friendly but it just takes one bad apple in a restaurant service   Later we heard him grumble that they only made      today to another worker  Don t know what that means exactly except that he s a big grumble pot ,3,2016-04-21
The filet mignon carne con pan is one of the best sandwiches I ve had anywhere   Also the braised beef  and caldo del mar are delicious as well ,5,2015-12-17
We waited forever  and I expected to be underwhelmed  I was not  this place is worth the wait  the meat well cooked  the veggies seasoned perfectly  and on top of that it is just a fun scene to sit with friends and enjoy a meal ,5,2015-10-31
Surprisingly met Expectations on both visits  Beef is cooked near perfectly  Wish the steaks could be ordered in larger than  oz and   oz but no big deal   Facts   Four types of chimichurries  Steaks and steak sandwiches At least one type of fish on menu     sides ranging from beans and greens to potatoes to eggplant to mushrooms Homemade empanadas  slightly overrated    Drinks are BYOB  wish they served glasses of house wine  Lines anywhere from   mins    hrs  Staff is nice and pretty attentive    Recommendations  make it easier to get back in line for ordering dessert drink etc and serve house wine by glass  BYOB is much appreciated but not everyone plans ahead  plus you would make a lot more money ,5,2018-12-29
I ve lived in Argentina  Netherlands and Argentine Queens  NYC   NOTHING comes close to the authenticity  especially in Pittsburgh ,5,2015-02-13
There is nothing bad to say about this place  I try to stop in for lunch whenever  I am in the area  The dinner line scares me but not enough to rule this place out  Try all the sauces  BYOB  Order extra bread ,5,2019-03-19
Incredible steak cuts   Sauces are even better   Get there early or stand in line outside   ,5,2019-03-12
Love these guys  Anthony knows what he s doing  Steak Burger is best burger in town and I stand by that  Killer Americana twist on classic Argentina Specialties  Only one problem  I can t get enough  Awesome awesome food ,5,2013-12-04
Now  everyone talks about this place  Your mom  your cousin  daddy  step father  sister  cousin   everyone  I certainly didn t want to try it out because of all of the hype  Well  the hype is warranted  This place is everything  I mean everything  Like the moon and the stars type of everything   I arrived around       am on a Friday  It was a good thing that I did because the lunch crowd appeared at about        Once you arrive  you stand in line  and on the wall is a large chalkboard menu  You order at the front  pay and then you are seated  Someone then  brings your order to the seating area  and yells your name  They then bring your dish to your table    I got the Carne sandwich with rib eye and a side house salad  The sandwich was so big and scrumptious  I literally  drooled on the table when I opened it up  the sandwiches come in that sandwich paper   I should have known it would be good  the paper it was wrapped in was so greasy  The meat was so tender  and the onions  the caramelized onions leave nothing to be desired  The house salad was a perfect size  and I believe they make their own dressing  It was peppery and tangy    I loved my experience here  The service was quick  the place was clean  and the staff was polite  It was a great place to celebrate the end of the work week ,5,2017-01-16
Outstanding every time  My husband is from Argentina  and he swears by Gaucho  The empanadas are just like you eat in Argentina  and the provoleta is amazing  Be sure to leave room for dessert as the alfajores are awesome    We started going shortly after they opened when it was counter service only  They expanded to the next building  and the new look is beautiful ,5,2015-09-24
I can t say enough about this place  I spent my birthday dinner here and it exceeded my already high expectations  First  byob is a huge plus  Second  every single thing I tried was just so good  The grilled vegetable platter was my favorite and I m a huge fan of all of their dipping sauces at your disposal    The service and staff were all friendly and the casual dining atmosphere was great  I can t wait to go back    Make sure you get there early ,5,2015-12-04
If you re one of those people that enjoys finding unsuspecting  delicious  hole in the wall places    you will LOVE Gaucho  Settled in an unsuspecting part of the Strip District  it is a restaurant full of vibrant food  and people to match   Don t expect to sit inside  there are only about   or   seats to choose from  I got the El  Pavo sandwich with grilled corn and it cost me about      Not bad   The staff seemed excited to see us and were genuinely happy to be there  They checked up on us outside to make sure we were happy with everything    I didn t get to take a picture   I was too busy enjoying the meal     TL DR    Great food  Great staff  Food with integrity  A must go to in Pittsburgh ,5,2014-10-09
Good good and great service  Busy place so you may have to wait for a short time  The food is worth the wait ,5,2018-06-24
Gaucho is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh  Every dish that I ve tried there has been incredible  The employees are so nice and are happy to answer any questions about the menu  Note that Gaucho is BYOB and you ll most likely have a LONG wait outside of the restaurant ,5,2018-11-03
You order at the counter and pay first  but it s nicer than it sounds  This place a cool vibe and good service  But the food is why this place has a line out the door    The empanadas are not the traditional ones I m used to   I ve been to Argentina several times  but they are good  We liked the pork one the best  The rosemary and garlic red skin potatoes were awesome   Much more flavor than normal boring potatoes  The steak was  dry good  and the bread was outstanding  The sauces were tasty and plentiful too    I highly recommend this restaurant when in Pittsburgh ,4,2017-06-16
In town for the weekend and heard great things about this place  Called ahead on a Saturday around  pm to see how long the line was to get in and it was about   hours  This place does not take reservations and you have to wait in line for seating  Called back later on and line died down  Got there and was seated within   min deff worth the wait  Great steaks and Argentinean flavor  It is BYOB and liquor stores close early around here so come prepared  I really enjoyed their set up  how you order and pay first at the counter then get seated  very different ,5,2019-05-12
Perfect in every way  Simple plates  amazingly prepared  If you don t try this place  you all sorts of crazy ,5,2014-07-27
I m sorry  I can t write a review about this place  Why   Because there is only one word  AMAZING      I mean so amazing that I m speechless   I m only in Pittsburgh to visit but I don t think I ll ever find steak like this again  The wood burning grill  the service  and the FOOD    Check it out   Owner said they are expanding soon  ,5,2014-02-01
Everything is good here  The steaks were tender  perfectly cooked and seasoned  and melts in your mouth  The chicken appetizer  grits  and potatoes were all amazing  I d make sure to also try all the sauces  The beef empanadas were just okay but I d skip them if you want more potatoes or grits    They don t have parking and it can be a pain in the ass to find street parking  There are some parking lots nearby but they accept cash only  The line for the restaurant can also get really long so I d try to time it by coming in off peak hours if you don t have too much time  Despite those things  I will definitely try to come back if in Pittsburgh ,5,2017-12-30
Gaucho is probably the most highly rated place to eat in the burgh   And that s because they god damn deserve it    I first experienced Gaucho at Pittsburgh Winery for a Yelp event  I tried their braised roast beef with horseradish sauce and was in love  The sauce complemented the beef so well and it was so unique  I also tried their chanchito  pork tenderloin with arugula  pickled red onion and mushrooms  Incredible  By far my favorite  The last item I had that night was their grilled shrimp with rice  I honestly don t know if I have ever had shrimp that juicy before and the flavors were out of this world good    Tonight I had the opportunity to go to Gaucho for the first time  Located at the beginning of the strip  close to downtown   it s not very large at all  There were enough seats for about   people  bar style  It was around     when we arrived and we didn t have to wait too long for some seats to open up  I ordered a steak plate    oz hanger steak with a small salad and toasted bread  I also ordered some grilled maiz  corn   The boyfriend ordered the braised roast beef sandwich and my friend Nick ordered the carne sandwich  flank steak with red peppers on ciabatta    I had the chance to try everything    Wow  The braised roast beef sandwich was incredible  my boyfriend was obsessed with the sauce and had to ask for extra  Nick let me try his sandwich and the flank steak was awesome  So juicy and went so well with the peppers    My steak plate was crazy good   Charred and smoky with tons of spices and super juicy  The grilled corn was amazing too  My mouth is watering just thinking about it    This place is worth the hype  It s insanely delicious  Go there  Now ,5,2014-11-29
My girlfriend and I stopped by Gaucho on a Friday night  and surprisingly it wasn t too busy  There was a bit of a wait however because of a private party being held  Even so  the wait wasn t terrible  The waitstaff was friendly and they seem to be organized   I ordered the Arrachera  flank steak  and my girlfriend ordered the Bife de Gaucho  ribeye   Both of the steaks were well cooked and flavorful  While they were not nearly the best steaks I ve had  the quality for the price is great   I d definitely recommend Gaucho to any meat lover  but be prepared for a bit of a wait ,5,2017-08-19
The beef is more tight than the normal American style steak  I guess the meat has less marble  However  it is a pleasant experience to have the meat with several sauce together  I like the Argentina pesto the most ,4,2019-03-24
The hype is real    Ordered   Bife de Chorizo   NY Strip  rare Los Sprahts   Brussel Sprouts  sweet peppered bacon  and cider reduction Caldo del Mar   Mussels  clams  squid  fried capers  lemon  garlic  tomato  and a secret ingredient   My favorite part is that it s not ridiculously expensive  I recommend the steaks  and the brussels were really good  I was disappointed by the seafood  next time I ll just stick to the land meat    I ve looked through the many pictures  and I d want to come back and try the sandwiches too   The only downside or unimpressive part of Gaucho is that the eating area could be improved   it feels like a McD s dining room  Wobbly chairs and tables ,5,2016-06-06
We went to the Strip just to try Gaucho because there has been so much hype about the restaurant  I ordered the burger and it definitely did not disappoint  I really like how you wait in line to order before being seated  That really sped up the process  We got our food pretty quickly and it wasn t too crowded until noon  By the time we left  the line wrapped around the side of the building ,5,2016-02-07
YAAAY   This was the  nd time my  honey and I went here and OMG AMAZING    My honey had the New York strip steak sandwich with that yummy corn that makes your mouth shout SECONDS PLEASE      I had a steak empanada with the roasted potatoes  I looooooove sauces so I went to the sauce bar and packed   little cups with different sauces to dip my potatoes in and they were yummazing     Yaay   I ll truly miss this gem in Pittsburgh  but back to New Orleans I go ,5,2015-02-27
Unique restaurant  Had flank  the meat was fresh and cooked to perfection  Call in for a table as at times it is busy and has long Q  BYOB  so be prepared if you plan to ,4,2019-04-18
This restaurant is really hot right now  It is a different set up from the traditional restaurant where there is a dedicated waitress or waiter  You walk in and order from the front counter  leave your name and they bring your food to your table  It s byob and they don t charge a corking fee   All food is ala carte and you can order any combination you want  Reasonably priced and good quality  I recommend trying different sauces and enjoying the flavours ,4,2016-08-23
Went here with some friends on a Saturday  Waited in line for about     hours  It s byob so we had some drinks and it was fun  The people were nice and the food was outstanding  Worth the wait  Love it,5,2018-09-24
Hands down my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh  If you love steak you must eat here  The meat is divine   tender  juicy and made to perfection just the way you like it  You can get your favorite cut of steak in small or large size  Also comes with salad  toast  and chimmichurri  And don t forget to try their   different sauces    You order at the counter and then your food is delivered in a pretty quick fashion  The food is served on these cute wooden platters and the whole restaurant has a rustic hip kind of vibe    If you want an app  get the roasted carrots which are amazing   marinated with smoked honey and goat cheese  so yum  Heard the sammies are delicious as well so will have to try them the next time I m in Pittsburgh    On top of that it is BYOB so how can this place get any better   Note  they do not accept reservations so come early ,5,2019-09-14
This place has   stars for a reason  The chorizo sandwich was excellent and cooked to perfection  The fire roasted red pepper on it was not burnt and the ciabatta that it came on was very soft and fresh  The dipping sauces are very bold in flavor and you can get a side of tasty seasoned potatoes for only     Service is very friendly and the outdoor seating is clean and comfortable  I recommend this place to anyone in the Strip District who is looking for a quick bite to eat  The quality of the food can be compared to that of an upscale bistro ,5,2013-09-03
After much hype and reading the reviews  I decided to go here with my friends for  A nice Friday evening out  To be honest  it was disappointing  We were there early  and I always wondered why there was a line out the door  The reason being that you order and pay up front and hope they have a table  The menu is a giant chalkboard that is kind of hard to read  We luckily were one of a few groups there so we didn t have any trouble    We got   entrees for   people  The Large Shrimp  Pork Chop  and the Lamb Shank  We did not get any drinks  sides  or apps  Our total bill before tip         Now after paying that much  sitting at the table  and getting the sauces  Our food came  The pork chop was a nice portion size that came with a little salad  The lamb shank was a small size that came with some orzo  and the shrimp     little shrimp  Was the food tasty   yes  Was it worth the money  That s another story   Now listen  I cook a variety of dishes regularly  I  m a novice baker  I m a foodie and appreciate great tasting food  I understand that portion sizes may be smaller at some places  I have paid for small portions and felt that it was worth the money  But for     and to get    shrimp that is supposed to be an entree  aka main course   no matter how good is disheartening  Everyone of us was not satisfied  We all left hungry    In short  expect a wait  expect to drop a pretty penny  and don t order the shrimp ,2,2017-11-21
So I have walked by this place numerous times and the line is insane  Today I finally got lucky  Walked in no lime and so glad that I did  Staff is very friendly  I ordered the half chicken with garlic and rosemary red potatoes  I took it home and it was phenomenal  I will definitely eat there again  The Mexican Coca Cola was a good twist ,5,2017-03-10
Probably one of the best sandwiches I ve ever had  A must try is the steak   which you can get in any cut   on toasted ciabatta with the roasted veggies  add avocado and dip heavily into any of their   luscious housemade chimmichurries  Amazing  I Can only eat half and save the rest for a later snack or meal   ,5,2014-10-20
The meat here is so good it will convert vegetarians back to reality    Yelp Girls like to say  hidden gem    This is is not a hidden gem   This is a shining beacon to carnivores everywhere to come partake in beef bliss     And the prices are great   All the taste of a high end steak house for half the cost and none of the pretentiousness   Dine in a relaxed atmosphere with brick walls  hardwood floors  and exposed heat pipes and abundant natural lighting   Did I mention BYOB with no cork charge   If you forget  the friendly staff will tell you where you can buy drinks near by   This place is ranked    in the Yelp Top     in the Country   Its not a fluke  Click your Bookmark button   Even if you re a Prius driving Vegan    You won t be disappointed ,5,2015-07-21
Stumbled upon this little gem based on the recommendation of our hotel driver   The curb appeal us simple with cute homemade signs but the olfactory appeal was off the chart   We were told that the line often wraps around the building   Not knowing what Argentinian food entailed  we went in  read the giant chalkboard menu   and we were hooked   Tried the pollo sandwich and the rosemary beef sandwich as well as shareable sides   carrots with hot honey and goat cheese   roasted red potatoes and corn roasted in olive oil   Portions were huge   prices were low   This is a bring your own alcohol restaurant if you choose to imbibe   You order and pay at the counter  then given a table  may be shared  and then served   While ordering the kitchen is in plain view   I observed everyone sharing space and humming like a well oiled machine   Everything we ordered was delicious   our entrees came on very dense bread which we discarded but could have been ordered deconstructed   Overall this was indeed a restaurant we shall revisit and would highly recommend   Noted that weekend lines can be long   We got lucky   Go ,5,2019-05-05
My absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh  It s never been a disappointment  and everyone I take here asks to go back  I d recommend you read the menu  get the type of meat you ll enjoy  because I love it all  Rare   stars from me ,5,2019-07-05
unique sandwiches and other dishes that have all been tasty  reasonable prices considering the popularity,5,2018-04-11
Every time I m in Pittsburg I eat here    really a special place and the best steak  They even gave me pointers on how to make steak at home better ,5,2017-09-19
Best steak sandwiches I ve ever had   Staff is very knowledgeable and always friendly   The chef Kurt D  is one of the most talented in the city   Always a pleasure to visit ,5,2016-02-04
A great establishment in the Pittsburgh area  A must if you are in the area  Here is my breakdown   Pros   Great menu selections   Good pricing for the quality of food you are getting   Quick turnaround on the food   The sauces are amazing   Friendly service  Cons   They take no reservations and there tends to always be a line   plan accordingly   Come at off peak hours to avoid a long line,5,2019-11-06
Simply the best food in Pittsburgh  The food is all super fresh  the sauces are amazing ,5,2019-02-08
Cool experience  food was cooked and marinated so well  Loved the sauces   even purchase some To go  Would recommend   come back  Good prices ,4,2019-07-27
I love this place  I eat here at least once a week  Prompt service and great food  Get the grilled corn and any of the steak plates ,5,2015-10-05
The food was great here as was the service  The only reason I m giving this   stars is how we were greeted when we first there  We walked in with a group of   on a busy night  It was already a lot of people in the restaurant and the line was long  It was so cold so we squeezed into the door and were rudely told to wait outside because there wasn t enough room inside  which we get  However  her delivery could have been better  We hadn t even ordered or sat down to eat and that really just turned us off   Thankful for the kindness and welcoming smiles from the employees taking orders and the attentiveness and kindness from the wait staff  Also  the food is amazing so that turned our experience around   We decided to order a bunch of food and do a sort of family style  We decided to do that because there were so many things that we wanted to try  Glad that we did because nothing disappointed us  We got small plates  sides  and a meat plate    For sides we got papas al horno  roasted red skin potatoes   broccolini  and roasted mixed vegetables  The small plates that we did chor y pan  sweet or spicy sausage   camarones  grilled shrimp   and provoletta  provolone cheese on toast with oregano and salad   Then we did the asado steak platter that came with chimichurri sauce  It was all so amazing,4,2018-12-05
Food was phenomenal    Had the pork tenderloin as per the suggestion of the cashier  The bread that came with it had a Smokey grill flavor that complimented the perfectly cooked pork and caramelized onions  The sauces I got on the side were like a creamy lemon garlic sauce and you can also get chimmichuri   I saw two other sauces but I did not try them and don t know what they are  both the ones I chose were so good that I actually ate some plain right out of the ramekin after I finished my pork lol   it was that good      Can t wait till they get the wine flowing here so I can pair that pork with some Old Vine Malbec  Great food   great atmosphere   Great staff    ,5,2019-10-05
Made it back and was so happy I did  If you are looking for the entrance it is easy to spot  Just look for the line of people curling around the on ramp to the   th St Bridge   My only problem was parking  I managed to snag a spot but the meter wouldn t take my credit  card and I had just enough quarters for a little over an hour  I hurried over and got in line  They had a new girl who was polling the lines to answer any questions I had concerning the menu  I asked her for the fastest options since I was contemplating having to take my sandwich and run  She suggested the braised beef or the pollo chicken  sandwich  or the pulled pork   Since I had my mind set on the braised beef with caramelized onions and horseradish that would be an easy choice  I really couldn t see much of the restaurant except that I noticed it did have outdoor seating as well as table and high top seating  I waited approx    minutes to order my sandwich and then asked how long would it take  They told me just   minutes and they gave me change in quarters to run out and  feed the meter  while they prepared it   I ran out and back and found that my sandwich was ready and waiting for me  I decided to order the Argentine cookies as a small dessert since I knew that bread was thick  It was almost like eating a sandwich from a NY deli  The beef was just right with the toppings added on it  They did have an area where you could add different sauces to your sandwich  If you want additional toppings then you would need to add      according to the chalkboard menu   While i was enjoying my sandwich the manage came around and addressed me by name and asked how I was liking my meal  I replied  very good  and asked him about my recent visit during the renovations  He explained to me that during that time they were expanding and with the line completely out the door I could see why   They had apologized that they did not have the chocolate or coffee cookies but I was happy with the shortbread ones  They were macaroon filled cookies and they had coconut on them  It was just enough and very good to finish off my meal  Staff is very friendly and helpful   I was able to make it back to my car with time to spare and head on my way  My advice is to allow at least   hours if you are visiting this place since it would have normally taken  I was told        minutes  Take out is available but the wait time is just the same  If you are planning to visit it along with shopping in the strip district then I would suggest a parking lot or garage ,5,2015-07-16
Nice little place in the heart of downtown  Pittsburgh    Ordered the mixed meat platter  steak  chicken and spicy sausage   The food was cooked well and pretty tasty   Line up wasn t bad when I came in  maybe       mins  Leaving the restaurant the line up was out the door ,4,2017-11-18
The best steak you can get out  The seasonings and wood fired taste is amazing  Call ahead and pickup is best choice during busy times  My go to place when I m in the strip district ,5,2019-06-11
I been around trying food over and you cannot go wrong with this place  It s a Gem  It s a little piece of heaven when it comes about meat ,5,2015-03-01
Super small place  fits seven people at best  their expanding next door early      though  BYOB  no charge  I got the rib eye to go and was amazed   Good portion sizes too  Definitely a place to try if not make a top spot once a month   ,5,2014-12-13
Seriously  don t waste your time reading this review  Get your butt in line  now  Try the corn   chicken sandwich  Amazing  Honest   just get there ,5,2015-10-16
Food was good but we were disappointed that our appetizers were delivered at the same time as our entrees    Made it hard to appreciate it all,3,2016-11-08
I loved this place   I wanted to eat here again the next day   Staff is friendly  the food is incredible   I highly recommend one of the steaks   we had the bistec  round eye cut  and wished we had ordered the    oz instead of the   oz   The Rosemary braised beef was good  but I m just a fan of juicy steak topped with one of their wonderful chimchurri sauces   Prices are good   Overall      stars if I could ,5,2016-09-30
We re from out of town and sought out recommendations from a friend  We placed reservations on Open Table  Our reservations were confirmed  Imagine our surprise when we arrived to find its first come  first served and a line around the block  It s all well and good that a restaurant has these rules however they should ensure they aren t covered by Open Table ,1,2019-09-15
One of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh   Every cut of meat is delicious here   For lunch  go for one of the sandwiches   For dinner  come with a group and order a combo platter of meat and the paella   Best to arrive outside of meal time because the line can get long ,5,2018-11-12
Rated as one of America s must have meals for a reason  The long line  which exists so long as this place is open for business  is well worth the wait   You cannot go wrong when ordering here  so have no fear ,5,2016-01-02
We finally corralled a group to check out their huge Paella pan and headed over to wait in line for an hour on a Saturday night   They don t take reservations and seat your group when you place your order   So plan on an hour wait around  PM on a Saturday   We opened our BYOB wine and drank it while we were waiting and shared it with some nice folks behind us     We started our meal with three veggie and three chicken empanadas with some of their unbelievable chimmi sauces   The garlic sauce was so good  I put a big old dab of it on the Argentina Salad too   Four of us split a large salad and it was plenty   It had some super fresh avocado slices  a red potato  roasted red peppers  carrots  and a mixed lettuce   The dressing was killer good vinaigrette   We stuffed ourselves with all of this deliciousness and then  the PAELLA PAN arrived and took over our table   This thing is HUGE   There was grilled lemon in the center ring surrounded by pieces of grilled chorizo and the entire ring was rimmed with fresh shrimp   The ratio of rice to protein was off but the leftover lemony saffron goodness came in handy before bedtime when round two of paella gorge fest occurred   Our service was outstanding  as always  and the meal was really satisfying for everyone   Super fresh  cooked to perfection and hot when it arrived   We really liked the brick walls and beautiful wooden plank floor   It s a great place for a group or a date   You really can t go wrong ,4,2018-02-11
In all the places I ve been  all the time I ve lived in Pittsburgh  and I only JUST made it to Gaucho last night for the first time     but it was so worth the wait   We decided to try to beat the crowd by being there around      on a Wednesday   It was busy  but not line wrapping around the building busy   There were about   parties in front of us and we stood for about    minutes   When we finally got to the counter  they opened our wine and gave us wine glasses and water  then we placed our orders   The menu is large and almost overwhelming because it all sounds soooo good   I ordered the deconstructed carne sandwich with flank steak  My date had the large Argentinean salad with flank steak   We were seated and our food came out about    minutes later    I got two of the sauces   one that pairs well with steak and the other that pairs well with vegetables   Everyone is so insanely friendly and helpful at Gaucho   you can really tell they enjoy their jobs and take pride in the food they serve   Everything was excellent   The food  the wine  the service  the atmosphere   I d say my only complaint is that I think they do such a great business but they could really take it to the next level by making it a traditional sit down  take your order and serve you type of place   I would be more inclined to go back regularly if that was the setup  but I just am turned off by the line   Definitely a place to try ASAP  ,5,2018-02-01
The food   The  Food   The food   Do it   Yes   Worth the wait   Did I say the food      Wow   No words just wow       Our    and two    year old boys loved it     Suggestion  Just order a lot of small plates and start sharing   After you sit you can very quickly order more of what you love    Try as many dishes as possible   The entrees were nice but when we got back it will be ordering in this style   Trying is key     We had the best experience,5,2018-07-06
Would have been higher without the annoying host making speeches every minute starting at  pm about people in line potentially being denied service even though they close at   pm ,3,2017-08-06
This place is Argentinian  Argentina is located in South America  This restaurant is in Pittsburgh  not South America but it is still good  The capitol of Argentina is Buenos Aires  Argentina borders Chile  Brazil  and Uruguay ,5,2019-01-02
This place has been the highest rated restaurant in Pittsburgh for a while and I ve been hyped to find out why  The lines have been a problem though  However  I decided to brave out the line  and was it worth it  The steak is beautifully done  The Cerdo  pulled pork  was also amazing  with the super sharp mustard on the side  The Chorizo was great  as were the Papas  In all  we probably ordered way too much food for two but we gulfed it all down  Did I say that their breads are amazing  This restaurant really made us feel like visiting Argentina soon ,5,2016-03-28
Go here  It s really a special place in the Strip district  My husband and I got here as they opened on a Saturday  It quickly became crowded  sometimes you ll see lines out the door  but make time for it  We ordered   different empanadas to try  They were good but not the highlight  I had the ribeye steak sandwich  so flavorful and tender meat  Husband had the rosemary pork sandwich which was even better  AMAZING  It s an order at the counter  find a seat and your food is delivered to table type of place  You must try the different sauces that they have at the service areas  The only reason this review is   instead of   stars is that my steak was cooked medium but I asked for medium rare  I really don t enjoy beef cooked above that  but the tenderness and flavor was still there  and the empanadas were just okay but they were enhanced by adding those amazing sauces though ,4,2019-03-15
Grilled veggie plate is great along with chi chi chicken  Squash is very good as well  Very fresh and a different take than typical chain restaurants    flavor from actual herbs and spices ,5,2019-04-18
Empanadas are truly great  BYOB policy is pretty nice  they offer glasses and will open your drinks for you at no extra fee     atmosphere is inviting and relaxed and staff is friendly,4,2018-10-13
Excellent  Excellent  Great meat and great flavor  Even the vegetables were grilled to perfection  And an incredibly friendly and helpful staff  I look forward to eating there again ,5,2014-08-22
Definitely my favorite spot in Pittsburgh  Everytime I m in town this spot is a must stop  This place is very different from your normal restaurant  They are a  crash the counter  restaurant meaning that you come in  order   pay first   then you re seated  I love this kind of style because you know the food is going to be amazing   the food here is beyond that  I also love the open kitchen  You can see all the cooks making everything   they use a REAL DEAL Argentinian grill  If you think you re gonna mosey into this place or make a reservation as well you re in for a rude awakening  Make sure you get there earlier than planned because the line is always long  Yes the food is that good  Also don t expect to see beer or wine on their menu because this place doesn t have a liquor license  The true beauty about this place is that it is BYOB   They also provide wine   beer glasses for you which is awesome  They are one of the only restaurants I ve ever been to that serves Yerba Matte  which won my heart lol  The menu changes from season to season I believe so make sure you go in to catch them when they have the rack of lamb it is TO DIE FOR  They also have a little sauce station with different homemade sauces which are excellent  They have a killer chimichurri   garlic sauce for their steaks  You can t go wrong with anything on the menu everything is great but I would definitely recommend their rack of lamb  It s a little over    bucks but I promise it s worth every penny  Like I said  it s my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh   I stop there whenever I can  Check this place out if you ever catch yourself in the Strip District   don t forget     its BYOB,5,2019-05-27
The food was delicious as were the dipping sauces  As you will read in many reviews  this place is jumping so there is often a wait  Try to go at off times during the day and you ll enjoy the experience much more ,4,2016-05-17
Gaucho is great   It s a very cool and unique dining experience   The food has been consistently delicious every time I ve gone   I ve always done some version of the meats  a salad  and I get the empanadas every time because they are amazing   It is on the pricier side but worth it   Their only downfall is the extremely long wait times on busier days   I ve waited for close to an hour before outside in the hot sun since the restaurant is so small   My advice would be to find some way to expand or add more seating if at all possible   It s worth waiting for but it would be nice if the lines didn t get so long   Otherwise a great spot to check out a least once if you live in Pitt ,4,2019-07-01
Amazing food and very friendly employees and close to the strip district  I have been multiple times for lunch with coworkers and it is always amazing  I usually get the flank steak plate and the small  oz is plenty large for lunch for me  I get the steak medium rear and it is some of the best steak I have had at restaurants  They also have   sauces that are really good and I usually use the roasted red pepper sauce on my steak and one of the green ones for the piece of bread they serve the steak plate with  I have also gotten the cheese prosciutto plate and the meat plate  chicken  chorizo  etc  and they are both really good as well  I have never been disappointed by anything I have ordered at Gaucho and have never heard anyone say anything bad about it ,5,2019-08-09
I stopped here after wondering where to get something to eat for dinner  I was a little worried about how long the wait would be after reading a few reviews  I rolled in around  pm and I gotta say there was hardly any wait  I was army table in about ten minutes and had my food about fifteen minutes later  But on walking in the staff was super friendly and I mean super super friendly  I had any questions they where sure to answer them and help me decide what to get being a first timer  The menu is pretty big and there seems like so many good options I wanted to get it all  I ended up settling on the sliced ribeye steak that was cooked to perfection with a perfect rare temperature  It was seasoned amazingly every bite was so juicy  It came paired with a salad and toast and it was all so fresh and the toast was such a great add on  I added on a side of potatoes and a veggie empanada and a beef one  The potato s where roasted with whole gloves of garlic and rosemary and sea salt it had so much flavor and the potatoes where the perfect softness not over cooked at all  The empanadas where good to but kinda small but they change them up regularly they said so that s a plus  They had a area where you could get different types of sauce in a little cup and all of them where so delicious but the red pepper one was by far my favorite  This place was everything I was hoping for plus more  I can t wait to return here again and try more of the menu  The staff and the food and the setting really just gave it that WOW factor ,5,2018-11-27
Gaucho is one of those must stop places in Pittsburgh   You can smell the wood fired cooking from down the block in the Strip      and usually see the line forming to get food atleast    minutes prior to them opening   I usually get the Braised Beef Sandwich with Horseradish when I eat here and honestly  it is fantastic  They have a selection of     condiments for you to apply to your food that are all amazing     from hot pepper to chimichurri sauce   Just make sure you get there early  and be ready to jump on a table when it opens bc the restaurant is too small for the amount of business that pushes through on a daily basis    Stay open minded and give them a shot ,5,2018-12-06
The food smells great from a block away  and the staff is super friendly   Be prepared to wait in line  though  and BYOB for that line  because you ll be there for a long while ,4,2016-05-14
This Pittsburgh place is an amazing find of exotic cuisine that is freshly prepared for reasonable prices  I m definitely planning on going back again before leaving    Mexican corn Steamed mussels Sauted shrimp in rosemary and garlic Large flanksteak Flan with blueberries and cantelope   Drink     ,5,2019-08-28
Don t want everybody to know about this place  It is really good  Opt for the steaks and skip sandwich  Corn is awesome and you have to get all the sauces  Probably my favorite place  Not fancy like theses other places that try to hard and fail  Simple awesome food and u almost have to take to go  To small to eat inside ,5,2015-01-31
Definitely a place to go with out of towners and show them one of Pittsburgh s best restaurants   We took a group here and they talked about it for the rest of the weekend   If you can  get to Gaucho early because it gets very crowded and you will have to wait in a line out the door and around the corner   The staff has the whole line  ordering  seating thing down to a science  so while it may take a little while  they are very efficient at getting everyone in as fast as they can   I m not that much of a steak eater  so I ordered the steak burger which was     and enormous  it was a little dry  but the sauces at Gaucho are delicious and were the perfect topper to the burger   Other members of my group ordered the Asado platter which is   different cuts of steak and served with toast   They loved being able to try the different types of steak and enjoyed them all   The side dishes here are just as good as the main dishes  we tried the beans n greens and the papas al horno and I could not get enough of either   Gaucho has so much good food and it is really reasonably priced   This will continue to be a place to share with others and to come for a great meal ,4,2018-11-29
l read a really positive review in a local newspaper about a year ago and decided to go there  The staff there was very helpful and personable and I ordered the braised rosemary beef sandwich to go  l liked the sandwich but the taste didn t blow me away so a few days later l ordered the carne with ribeye steak  First the focia bread was the best l ever tasted and was a perfect match for the delicious steak grilled medium rare over a wood fire  The fire roasted red pepper and grilled onion perfectly complimented the sandwich along with the chimicurrie   Well to make a long story short l made it my go to place for lunch after my dialysis every week  After trying out about half the menu  I settled on the carne with the fillet medium rare with provolone and saffron rice   l rarely give reviews but gauchos really set a new standard for quality and taste for a restaurant and is very deserving of all the superlatives they receive ,5,2016-03-06
Mmm mmm mmm this place is the best place to go for lunch in the  burgh     best known for their Argentinian wood grilled meat  breads  sandwiches  and steak  Sandwiches are really to die for     this is one of the few joints that I know that knows how to do sandwich bread just right  In particular my favorite sandwiches are the carne and the rosemary braised beef varieties  Any of the steak meat cuts you choose is guaranteed to be tender  lean  and juicy     go for medium rare  you won t regret it   I also really liked their corn     never knew that a cob cooked over a wood fire grill could be so delicious  Good small eats include the gauchos papas  seasoned roasted potatoes   which taste amazing due to the seasonings that they put on those potatoes  and camarones  shrimp   which are just impeccable with the seasonings and lemon juice ,5,2014-03-25
I do not even like steak but my party member was desperate to come here as it s seen as  THE PLACE  to go to if you are in Pittsburgh  The restaurants  first come first serve  idea is horrible  we had at minimum   people skip us bc they saw their friends  who didn t even end up sitting together   We waited for   hours  Once we ordered we did however get served very quickly  and while the food was appetizing  it wasn t worth the wait to anyone in my party  If you love steak and you don t mind waiting     hours I say go for it  The   sauces were probably my favorite part about the meal I got  ribeye steak plate  ,3,2019-11-03
Blindly picked this place  Get the carne with skirt steak  Damn  Amazing bread is the foundation of a great sandwich    stars ,5,2019-01-09
Outstanding food  If they would only move closer to Oakland      For carnivorous customers this is an outstanding choice  It would be help if they would take reservations but the food is so good     Highly recommend ,5,2017-11-22
The empanadas are unbelievably awesome  The chorizo sandwich was delicious  Seriously  not a single bad thing to say  Even the guy at the counter where we ordered was incredibly friendly  Love this place ,5,2019-03-05
Loved this joint  Really nice staff there and always yummy food ,5,2016-05-12
Good food  Steak sandwiches of all kinds with good sauces  Employees are jerks though  One big bald guy tried to run me over outside  and by the time I go to the front of the line  guess who was putting his apron on  Not just that one encounter though  Aside from a great sandwich  all you get here is attitude  Granted  it is a pretty great sandwich   ,2,2015-02-02
Truly enjoyed my experience tonight  My pro tip would be to come on a week night and early      ish if you can  as there isn t ever a wait  Because there was no line  my wife and I had like five minutes to drool over the menu on the wall before going up to the counter and spending the next five minutes working with the ultra friendly and helpful staff to get their recommendations   Let it be known that I always look for recommendations on Yelp  but when everybody loves everything on here  it s hard to whittle it down     Per the staff s recommendations we got the sirloin sandwich medium rare and the chory pan sandwich  Additionally  we decided to get two empanadas and a alfajore cookie    The meat was cooked expertly and the empanadas were surprisingly good  I don t care for goat cheese but the pork and cheese empanada was actually my favorite  The alfajore cookie tasted kind of like a shortbread cookie with caramel and coconut which wasn t my fave  but we came here to celebrate my wife and she can have whatever she wants      Will definitely be back on a week night at      for more,5,2019-05-24
Phenomenal  first time in Pitt  on my way out of town I looked for best place for lunch on yelp and this place did not disappoint   Got the carne sandwich with ribeye   Steak was perfect medium rare  smoke flavor was strong throughout  and seasoning was great   Next time in town I will be back ,5,2019-09-26
IN LOVE  Hands down the best restaurant in Pittsburgh  We always take our friends family from out of town here to show off our city s great cuisine ,5,2019-02-01
This restaurant was one of the highlights of our trip  It s BYOB and there are no corkage bottle fees  There was a line but we only waited about       minutes on a Friday and it was well worth it  We ordered the Asado Platter which includes    ounces of steak    different cuts   potatoes  and   pieces of toast  We didn t care for the toast but the potatoes cut so smoothly and melted in your mouth  The steak was really good  pair it with one of the four sauces they offer  incredible  We went in thinking we already knew which cuts we would like dislike and it ended up being the opposite  The Asado Platter was     ,5,2019-05-14
    stars technically  This place has lots to live up to with the reviews  Came early       p   and there was no line  We were on the stoop just outside the door  BUT   it still took   no joke   a full hour to step six feet from that stoop to inside and order  I can t imagine what the wait time would be if there was a real line   which I hear there often is  We were there a full   hours from arrival to finish with absolutely zero line outside   and this is an order at the counter and sit kind of place  The meat was good   about like what you d grill at home if you have a decent cook in the house  Sides decent  BYO is a great in theory   BUT when you spend an hour in line waiting to crack open that byo beer which is turning from ice cold to lukewarm every minute it sits in your bag    I d rather pay you  x as much for an actually cold beer once I sit down  And  or for a beer to bide the long SIX foot wait from stoop to inside  Service is friendly but waiting so very long when the wait distance in inches was so very short makes me think I d never chance this place in a peak time ,3,2018-09-01
This place is amazing   Definitely deserves all   stars   We had the carne sandwich with the ribeye   you can choose with   different cuts of meat    It had chimichurri sauce and was served on ciabatta bread and it was amazing   It was cooked and seasoned perfectly and was one of the most delicious steaks I ve ever had   We also had the potatoes papas which were perfectly crisped and seasoned to perfection  and the meat empanadas were also delicious   They also had a number of sauces you could choose to add and we sampled them all  and all were quite delicious   The staff were also super friendly and attentive  even though this wasn t a full service restaurant  they kept checking on us to make sure we were happy    They seemed to really pride themselves in their product   They don t have much seating area inside  but it was warm and cozy   It was too cold for the outdoor patio but it looked like a beautiful area overlooking the bridge that would be nice to enjoy lunch outside   Portions are also huge and very affordable given the amount of food and the quality ,5,2015-01-04
Amazing Fun Entertaining Awesomess  We waited in outside line for approximately     mins starting     pm on a Saturday  Well worth the wait and it s a staple in the  neighborhood  We had Steak  some  the sirloin I savored the Ribeye they were  Served to perfection if you haven t been  It s a must on the Bucket List,5,2019-11-04
Waited in line for an hour and    minutes on a Saturday during dinner time   but let me tell you it was so worth it     I feel like Gaucho is not just a place where you go to eat food  but more for the overall experience  The environment is bustling  warm  and very up and coming  I loved being able to pay for my meal in advance before we sat down so that when it was time to leave we didn t have to wave down the server for the check    We went for the Asato platter and it was a lot of meat  It was cooked amazingly well  I m not a steak fan actually but it was delicious I would say get sides if you go with this platter otherwise the meat is a little too overwhelming  Would recommend the potatoes and vegetables  Will be returning to try the paella    Expect to be there for much longer than a typical dinner because of the wait  But definitively one of the best places in Pittsburgh        would recommend to a friend,5,2017-04-25
This is a unique twist on an Argentine classic      for   oz and  x different cuts of meat decent price  The summer squash side was very good with caramelized onions  the best part was mixing the pepper sauce with the garlic give it a try   Service   everyone was friend   this isn t a restaurant with servers  Ambiance  very modern with hipsters all over  Price     for the entree  side and drink Value   worth it  Taste   steak was cooked well,4,2019-09-12
This was my first time here  I came with a group of friends most had been here before  I had the barn mi which was a pork butt sandwich on a delicious crusty baguette  We ordered root veggies and cauliflower sides both of which were delicious  It was not a particularly long wait  we came in later on a sat night and they close at ten   All of the meals were scrumptious  my vegetarian friend had a melted roasted cheese dish which she ate every bite of  The sauces were very tasty my favorite being the garlic one  All in all a great experience  I will be back ,5,2017-12-10
Is the food good   YES   Salad very good  sandwich very good   Is the food great   Almost great     sandwiches and   salads  plus   waters   about       Is that cheap  Of course not   To me    stars would be excellent food  and ideally at a price point I thought made sense   I do recommend everyone try this place  but   stars  to me  means fantastic   and unfortunately I think this place is slightly below that metric ,4,2015-04-05
Fantastic grilled meat  Visiting Pittsburgh and was told we had to visit  Initially put off by the neighborhood  The Strip is not much to look at  Any reservations we had about the neighborhood were quickly put to rest once we smelled the food  Started with three varieties of empanadas all of which were savory and delicious   For entrees we had a gorgeous burger served on ciabatta toast  perfect lamb chops and a grilled assortment platter with steak  chicken and sausage   Desert was available but we were too full   Friendly staff  quirky decor   Finally  BYO so don t forget a hearty red ,5,2017-08-05
Everyone loves Gaucho Parrilla and for good reason  Their main thing is steak  but I don t eat steak so I always get a salad  which in many cases would be disappointing  but at Gaucho it s not  It s not disappointing at all  I get the El Gaucho salad  which has avocado and a bunch of grilled vegetables  Today I added grilled shrimp and it was worth the extra       I ve also had the vegetable empanadas  grilled corn  and potatoes  I recommend each and everything I ve eaten there  And oh my god  all of the sauces  Delicious homemade sauces for you to drown your food in  or just for a little extra flavor  Whatever you want to do    Each time I ve gone to Gaucho new people have come with and no one is ever unhappy  One person I was with said it was  overly seasoned   but I don t like bland food so I am selectively disregarding his opinion ,5,2015-06-26
I don t know how to express how AMAZING Gaucho is   The food  the ambiance  the staff   it is a well oiled machine and worth every second of the wait outside    The steak is so delicious    and the sides  I highly recommend the carrots   and the people are super nice and the BYOB makes it even better   We had a large party and they took great care of us and I think it was probably one of the best meals I have had on my visits to Pittsburgh    Don t be scared off by the wait   it may be long but it is worth every second    ,4,2019-04-29
Stopped here before going to a show  Food was incredible and the wait wasn t too long  Love that it s BYOB  Would definitely recommend the steak sandwich or any of the empanadas,5,2019-10-22
Food was good but long waits and VERY loud environment  Had a meat tray of variety and a lamb tray  No alcohol served on site but they do allow BYOB  Wish they served as we didn t realize this prior to arrival ,4,2019-07-25
I had the lamb and my brother had the tilapia  Both were AMAZING  Great flavoring and ate every bite  They give u options of different sauces with the meats and they are so delicious  I can t wait to come back and try something else  Highly recommended ,5,2016-08-19
Food was good but that line  We ll go back to Fogo  which really isn t much more expensive and we can skip the standing around for over an hour ,3,2019-07-08
Right on the strip  great for fueling up pre post shopping  The menu can be a bit daunting on your first visit  but thank god there is always somebody in there to translate  The food and service quality has always been amazing and we have never been disappointed  You ll commonly see a line looping around the building  don t let that discourage a visit tho  The line diminishes quickly  so don t fret ,5,2018-04-01
What a pleasant surprise  I have never had Argentine food and it was absolutely delicious  Love that they have smaller versions of most items  This way you can try a few different items  My friend and I tried   different things all unique and equally delicious highly recommend this place  Don t be afraid to try the different sauces all very good and unique in taste,5,2018-08-02
This place was great  Great lunch  though it is a bit expensive  I had the chicken sandwich with separate side orders of empanadas and papas  All were delicious  but the sandwich was my favorite  I will definitely be back for more in the coming weeks  My coworkers loved their steak sandwiches ,5,2013-02-28
I ve so looked forward to writing this review  Not that writing Yelp reviews is something I daydream about on a regular basis  rather it would mean I had finally tasted the deliciousness that is Gaucho Parilla Argentina and pretty much gone to carnivore heaven  That is precisely what happened    My friend and I talked about coming here for months  but one thing or another kept preventing it  Yesterday we decided to make it happen  I read in some reviews that getting food can take time if it s busy  so I arrived before he did and put in our orders with the friendly and helpful staff at the counter  I loved the open  airy feel of the place and the easygoing rapport up front that the staff created  I also appreciated how the staff dressed and looked more like themselves and less like a traditional army of servers who all look the same  It was one of the most refreshing restaurants I ve ever been in for that reason alone    I made my way to the quieter back section of the restaurant and chose one of the lower center tables  There was sufficient room for the amount of space without feeling like other patrons were all up in your business  The room was also sunny  a huge plus  My friend and the food arrived soon afterwards  and we began to eat   Wanting to sample several meats we went with the mixed grill  which has steak  chicken  and chorizo  On the side we had two orders of potatoes  an extra order of toast  and all four sauces  I can t choose a favorite meat  because they were all utterly divine  The steak and chicken were so tender they pulled apart easily without a knife  and the chorizo had a satisfying snap to it as well as a spicy flavor that I loved immediately  The potatoes were roasted until crispy on the outside  and the toast was chewy perfection  My favorite sauce was difficult to choose  but I would have to say the thinner green one edged ahead slightly for me  I tasted an interesting sour note that complimented literally everything on the table  We ate everything but a few potatoes  and with two Mexican cokes the     bill seemed like a steal for the caliber of food we had just consumed  Gaucho exceeded my  incredibly high  expectations  and I can t wait to come back and share the steak platter I ve had my eye on and try some of the different vegetables  Gaucho  you re incredible ,5,2015-07-18
We came here for dinner but discouraged by a long queue outside the restaurant in a cold weather  we left to eat somewhere else  We came the next day for lunch and surprisingly the queue was not that long and we got to wait inside the restaurant which was promising  We ordered everything veg in their menu which tasted like little treats for our taste buds  We were excited by the four different house made dipping sauces which were packed with flavors  They noticed our curiosity and helped us with the details of each one of them  All four sauces were uniquely distinct in their taste and not to be missed during your visit  The garlic one is my least favorite though my friend loved it  I loved the herbs  Chimmi  one the most  Hot pepper and onion ones were equally good for me  We had them with tostado but they can go well with anything on their menu  The sweetness of vegetables came through well in the vegetable empanada  And the sandwich was also good  I would go back anytime for their dipping sauces  But you might want to go back for charge less BYOB or order their s  They are absolutely awesome in their service and the hype is all what they deserve  ,5,2018-04-08
Don t understand the hype  The food was ok but I paid over     for a small steak sandwich not really what I expected ,3,2016-07-22
This is one of the best steakhouses I ve been to  Ordered the New York strip and the flank steak  large portions and it s perfect for a group of   ppl   I like the BYOB option although I won t complain if they have drinks onsite as we may run short of drinks sometimes    outside is the best place to eat specially on a bright sunny day in Pittsburgh   on     please visit if you re fan of steaks  ,5,2019-09-19
Food was definitely pretty amazing and priced surprisingly cheap  Steak was awesome  sauces were unbelievable and the sides we re really good too    Just wish it was a bit bigger inside  It s also not a place to go if you re in a rush  but it is well worth the wait ,5,2015-06-20
Great food  Bad service  When we came in  granted it was    minutes before closing  the man behind the counter said  not like we are about to close or anything   I was very put off by this on my first experience  The food was great but a bad overall experience ,2,2014-10-25
Delicious fresh food at a reasonable price  The pollo was so tender and flavorful  There is limited space  but it s worth the wait ,5,2014-08-23
I really wanted to love this place  But I think I m spoiled by the good food in the other places I ve spent a lot of time    We walked the  ish blocks in frigid weather and waited for about half an hour until we finally ordered the ribeye and lamb  The lamb was fine though a little cold by the time it got to our table  However  the  pricey  mind you  ribeye was a disappointment  It was so lean that we had to ask the server if the kitchen gave us the right cut  He wasn t sure she d roll it back  only to come back to our table and say  oh it is ribeye  you can see a little bit of marbling there   but could have fooled me    laugh   I didn t know what was funny about expecting  and paying for  ribeye and getting something that looked and tasted like sirloin  but okay     On a positive note  the sauces are delicious  The carmelized onion one was our fave    Not sure I d return if I m ever back in Pittsburgh    P S  I post photos on instagram com letseatwithannie,3,2019-02-26
Though I am not a steak person  I have been here on a few occasions and it has not disappointed  We are well aware that there will always be a line of customers streaming out of the front door  rain or shine  hot or cold  The restaurant does not take reservations and they are a BYOB establishment which adds to their appeal    When entering the building  the menu is handwritten on a chalkboard wall  They have a variety of items ranging from salads  small plates  and sides  to sandwiches  exclusive plates  and specialty items such as paella  In addition they have a few pick up dessert items that they display nicely in glass containers as well as a few other options to have with a cup of coffee   Once deciding on the order  you walk up to a counter where an employee takes your drink menu  We brought wine and some bottled beer and she kindly uncorked the wine  no fee  and provided an ice bucket for the beer  offering for the wine as well  She gave us glasses of water to go along with our select beverages  They do have a few drink items one being Red Ribbon  an old fashioned bottled soda found in a variety of flavors  Next is the order and checkout station  and since the restaurant was packed  we spent time chatting with the employee until our table was ready  She took our order  we paid  and she sent us on our way to our table  I ordered the deconstructed pollo sandwich with toast with a side of roasted spaghetti squash  The chicken came with pickled red onions  lettuce  and mushrooms  The deconstructed version appeared smaller in size than what you would receive on the sandwich  well duh  no bread but still   but with the side of squash and toast  it was enough  They offer four different types of sauces to put with your meal and they are all rather tasty  In the past  I have had the pulled pork sandwich and I think that nudged out the chicken by a hair  It was delicious    This will be a place we will go occasionally  It is a fun restaurant to go to for an evening with a group of friends or couples and to not expect a rushed dining experience  The prices are so reasonable for a steak establishment  they allow you to bring your own beverages  and the food is fresh and made with care ,5,2019-03-15
Amazing food    Great people    Worth the wait but I prefer take out that way I don t have to wait    Yummy ,5,2016-08-22
My husband and I went there for my birthday and ordered the Asado Platter and six empanadas  the empanadas were too little but everything it was more than enough for the both of us  The chimis are amazing  There is no spicy ones   We waited a long time in line but they immediately served us our food   Perfect service from each and everyone of the people who served us ,5,2019-05-26
What an amazing dinner  I had the Pallida Mixta and Veggie Plate  Everything was cooked to perfection  The staff is incredibly pleasant and has a great attitude  Usually when a place is this busy someone doesn t have a smile on their face or you can tell that they don t enjoy their work  Well worth the wait in line that you will have to eat here ,5,2019-04-11
I came here for my   th birthday and have since been anticipating when we can come back  The steak is cooked to your preference   whatever you want  I hope to come back soon  This place is great ,5,2018-11-10
Awesome steak   Worth the wait   Empenadas and pulled pork were both just okay  but decent enough   No reservations and order at the counter  ordering was actually a little bit weird and inefficient  but the food more than made up for it ,4,2019-07-26
First visit of hopefully many   Initial shock was seeing a line going out the door and around the curb for    feet at  pm on a Saturday  It took us    minutes to get to the counter to order our food  Long wait  but well worth it   We ordered an Asado plate which includes all five cuts of their steaks for      We also ordered two empanadas  pork and chicken as well as roasted cauliflower and potatoes as sides  Not that we needed it  but just because of reviews and pictures  we ordered a steak burger sandwich  a small provoleta  and flans for dessert   Steak burger was the best  Asado was great  Flan was very good  Roasted cauliflower was also good  The rest not as much   Prices are reasonable  Their system of ordering and paying at the counter first is interesting and efficient  All staff and servers were friendly  helpful and efficient  Sauces were good but not really needed   steaks are good on their own   All in all  it was a nice experience  and we will stop by the next time we are in Pittsburgh for sure   And  remember that line at  pm  It was still there at  pm when we were leaving     not the same people but equally enthusiastic ,5,2017-09-24
Had the steak sandwich and the Plates Pork Platter   Absolutely worth every penny   Have had similar food in NYC and Miami   This place definitely compares  May even be better  Top notch   ,5,2018-07-07
The staff here is absolutely amazing   second only to the unbelievably delicious food      my cravings continue and anytime I m in the strip I have to make a stop at Gaucho   If you can   try to get there at an off time  harder and harder to find an  off time  as the place is super popular      however it is definitely worth the wait in line    I have always said    I will NEVER stand in a line to wait to get into a restaurant       but for Gaucho I have and will    absolutely worth it ,5,2019-04-07
There was a wait but it s definitely worth it  Would recommend getting the veggie empanada  they are amazing  It is a very comfortable setting and my family and I gushed over the food afterwards  I would recommend this place if you want to try something new but not to disappoint ,5,2019-03-27
My steak had a lot of silver skin on it  which made it chewy   Expected better based on all the   star ratings ,3,2016-09-04
  of   stars   Top   reasons to go     food is fantastic    staff is wonderful    cost vs what you get is awesome     although the line is long  it moves very quickly  one reason not to go     parking can be extremely difficult,4,2019-08-20
My husband and I are new to Pittsburgh and we eaten their twice in less than two weeks   Great menu  excellent quality  service and value   There is always a line  but it is well worth the wait ,5,2016-06-27
If you re a carnivore  Gaucho is as good as it gets  Even if you re not  there s an amazing Vegetable sandwich that comes on ciabatta bread  gets me every time  They recently expanded into a bigger area  but I haven t been there since  It s actually challenging for me to eat here  because there are so many delicious options  To top off each selection  they provide different sauces  my favorite is the chimichuri  that you can choose from to compliment your sandwich  However  I have found that the sandwiches are bursting with so much flavor do not even need the sauces  There is nothing like going to the strip Saturday morning and walking into gaucho for an early lunch    I ve never been to Argentina  but smelling the aroma of the meats and just the friendly atmosphere that the employees create  makes me feel like I ve walked off of Penn Ave and right into another country  A winner for me is the filet mingnon sandwich with roasted red peppers  caramelized onions on fresh  homemade ciabatta bread  Trust me  you can t go wrong  Stop in and treat yo self ,5,2016-01-12
This place was everything I read about and loved everything  I had the filet carne sammie and tried all the sauces which were all delicious  The empanadas were great had the beef and pork with the pork being the best   The line had us waiting about    minutes but once inside were seated and food arrived within minutes  Definitely a must for everyone to try ,5,2016-11-05
I ve now been to Gaucho twice and I m pretty sure I ll be back again  There is plenty of street parking if you like to parallel park   and also a few public lots over on Smallman you can park in and walk over if you suck at parking like me    Both times I ve been there has been right around lunch time on a weekday and I have never waited more than   minutes to get to the counter  Everyone that works at Gaucho Parrilla is very friendly and very helpful  I appreciate the warmness and it s only surpassed by how good the food is  Every single dish that I ve tried there has been fantastic  The meats are so flavorful and tender  the vegetables are grilled and seasoned to perfection  the dessert shortbread cookies are some of the best I ve ever had  The chimichurri sauces that they offer are a great accompaniment to all these wonderful entrees    It definitely isn t a cheap place to eat  but the food and the quality of the ingredients are definitely worth the price    The best tip I would give for eating here is to pay attention to the menu board when you walk in  and maybe snap a picture on your phone for reference when you get to the register  If you don t remember what you want it s kind of a hassle to have to walk back over to check the board ,5,2018-07-12
We arrived    minutes before closing time on a Friday night but they were already closed up   Pathetic  don t waste your time ,1,2018-11-10
Arrived at      on a Friday night and there was no line so we went for it  The service was great and the food lived up to the hype   We had a large steak plate and one of each empanadas and the corn  The steak was perfectly cooked and the onions bread and salad were awesome  There are four different sauces available and I recommend getting all of them to dip meat  bread and empanadas  The dough of the empanadas was perfect and almost flaky    Enjoy ,5,2019-05-26
Un lieu unique   Pittsburgh  La qualit  de la viande est extra et parfum  avec des  pices merveilleuse ,5,2014-04-16
After reading about this place for a couple years I was finally able to visit while I was in Pittsburgh on business  After waiting in line for    minutes by myself I finally ordered the ribeye  Oh my  This steak was on the short list of best things I ve ever eaten  I went back the next day well aware of the wait and ordered the steak sampler  It was really good  but I definitely recommend sticking with the ribeye  This place is a must visit if you like steak and you re in Pittsburgh ,5,2019-01-28
Hands down the best restaurant in all of Pittsburgh  Don t be scared when you see a line that stretches around the block and maybe even down one of Pittsburgh s iconic bridges    this place is worth the wait   To be honest I loved the food so much I even booked a trip to Buenos Aires to find out if this restaurant would hold up to the real thing  Let me be the first to tell you that every morsel that this restaurant serves is the real deal   I highly recommend getting the Parillada Mixta so you get to try a variety of things but my favorite items on the menu are the Camerones  Shrimp  and Chorizo Spicy  You can t go wrong with any of your choices   ,5,2019-10-31
Closest you will ever get to Buenos Aires  Argentina   Great Job   ,5,2016-03-18
This place is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh   I love to take people here if they haven t been here before  You can get a ton of food for the table to share for not a ton of money  The steak is always perfectly cooked ,5,2019-01-13
Get in line early for lunch or dinner   There will be a line   Better yet  order ahead of time  skip the line and pickup your order   This little neighborhood gem is a rare find   Check out their kitchen and bakery through the windows to the right of the front door   The food is terrific   Don t miss this ,4,2017-03-05
Helpful friendly staff great food very much a step above the short rib AP is hands down perfect for a warm summer afternoon,5,2014-08-08
Full marks for food and service  less half a star for the wait time   even though the food was more worth it   I couldn t tell you how we got to Gaucho Parrilla  or where it is  but I can tell you from the moment I began researching places to eat for our Pittsburgh trip there was no place I wanted to be more  At first looking at the level of the care and quality used to make the food in the pictures and the name  I expected this place to be uber fancy and pricey   not so  GPA is a little more than a takeaway joint just with seating  not enough mind you    but seating nonetheless    You basically should prepare yourself for a       min   wait time  not inside    outside  You brave that and you ve essentially earned the right to dine here  We braved it  despite grumbling tummies and hangry door blocking to ensure no one got in ahead of us or skipped line   We went a bit crazy for our order but shared everything so we could try as many things as possible  In no particular order   Pork empanadas   more batter than meat  well cooked and flavourful but not super memorable tbh  Spicy Chorizo   the fire roasted bread and peppers served make my mouth water all on their own but that chorizo was a spicy little gift  Could have just eaten     of these and been totally content   Rosemary Beef sandwich   HOLYYEEEEEE  So big  so juicy  so  much  beef  It was so good I wanted to press my face in between the buns and motorboat that meat   judge me if you must but eat here first and then come back to me  Easily top   sandwiches of my life   Large Ribeye   and as if I wasn t already praising glory be to the Argentinian meat gods on high after the sandwich  they go ahead and perfectly cook  slice and season a glorious ribeye steak and smother it with sauce   EF  ME  UP right here  I d stab someone if they got in the way of me eating this   So succulent  dripping with fatty flavours and cooked perfectly   All in this is definitely no veggie vegan friendly but carnivores beware this is your happy place   it sure was mine  First stop when I m back in town for a Steelers game next year is GPA   Eatcrest Out,4,2018-12-17
There s two people Pittsburgh that I truly trust when it comes to food  and Gaucho was the first restaurant that both of them mentioned as a must visit for me   And they were right   Whether you re getting a sandwich  a salad  or a plate  be prepared for charred meaty goodness  and absolutely gigantic flavors   A few reasons I knew I was going to like Gaucho BEFORE I even got my food      There was a gang of grandmas on bikes leaving when we walked in  I ve  never seen a gang of grandmas on bikes before  so as far as I know these grandmas only eat at Gaucho  Which seems like a strong endorsement      The nice young woman behind the counter was wearing a necklace scarf made of receipt paper  and making it look good  Basically  everyone that works here seems like they enjoy their job  which is always a good sign      The menu is full of all the things I want in my life   A few reasons I really  really loved Gaucho AFTER I got my food      The Carne Sandwich  This comes with your choice of steak  I went ribeye  which was a juicy  fatty  perfect medium rare  sliced up and slapped onto that amazing bread with char grilled peppers  If they put more chimichurri on it  it would ve been perfect  Luckily  they have jars of chimichurri  available  I put more on  and it was perfect      The Paletilla de Cordero  This is a roasted lamb shank with root vegetables in a phenomenal gravy  over grits  with a charred piece of bread to top it off  It is impossible to decide whether this dish was more beautiful or delicious  because it was so beautiful  and so delicious      The Gaucho Salad  This fresh and colorful salad is the exact thing to order on top of two disgustingly meaty dishes to make you feel like you didn t beast too hard at lunch  But you did  You really  really did      The sauces  Yes  the chimichurri is fantastic and I want to slather it on everything  But don t sleep on the other sauces  This joint knows flavor  and I would gladly drink the ajo  the pimenton  and of course  the always enigmatic quiquirimichi   In case you didn t realize  my list of things I love after I got my food was all of my food  Because all the food here is delicious  Don t miss it                 It turns out chimichurri is autocorrected to  chino hurry   Which is racist  Apple  But chinos and everyone else should probably hurry to Gaucho before they run out of meat   I don t think they ever run out of meat  ,5,2017-11-03
Went on a Saturday at   pm  We thought it would be slow but we were wrong  The line went out the door and seating  orders had been stopped until space cleared up  Once we got our food     mins later   it was easy to see what all the fuss was about  We ordered the ASADO PLATTER  Wow  Now I m a steak lover but I don t think I d had an abundance of different  and delicious  types of meat at once like I did that day  My favorite were  the skirt and flank steak  the NY strip was close second  but they were all succulent and mouth watering  Also ordered the CHORYPAN  which had a kick to it but was still very savory and complimented well by the onions  CREMINI SHROOMS were well made and did not have the mushy texture that mushrooms sometimes get  but they weren t dry either  QUIQUI CHICKY was also very well seasoned and properly cooked  The chimichurri sauce that the chicken came in was the perfect touch  Having chimichurri sauce easily available for the other meats was a plus  VEGETARIAN  the place is primarily meat based but there are some options you can customize  empanadas  eggplant special  sweet potatoes  roasted spaghetti squash  cremini shrooms to name a few ,5,2019-04-26
This place was just a few blocks from the hotel  As we got there on foot at  pm there were people lined up out the door  It was just   degrees  You wait online and give your order at the counter  then they seat you and will bring your food when ready   It is BYOB   The entire kitchen staff  I think  is in their   s  but MAN can they cook  We had the  oz strip and ribeye with potatoes and grilled spaghetti squash  It was the most enjoyable steak I have ever had  It took us an hour from arrival to seating but it was Sooo worth the wait  even in the very cold  I definitely wasn t dressed for it   I would do it all over again  This is a definite MUST eat here if you visit Pittsburgh  ,5,2018-11-12
I absolutely loved this place   The food is absolutely divine and the addition of the chimmi churri sauces made everything better  My friend and I both ordered the Parilloda Mixta which consists of the chicken  chorizo  and NY Strip  We also ordered a small plate of grilled shrimp  yellow rice and roasted potatoes  My steak was well done and the chicken with the green chimmi sauce made it more flavorful  The sausage was a little salty for me but the next day I finished the rest and weirdly it was perfect  I wish we would ve remembered to bring a bottle of wine since its BYOB  There was not as much seating as I would have liked upstairs but we managed to snag a table as a couple got up to leave  The menu was a little confusing at first but I just hopped on yelp and the pictures on here helped us out tremendously  We were both extremely satisfied and we will definitely return  Our meals were worth every penny ,5,2015-07-04
There is something about Gaucho that makes me drool   Just standing outside you smell the amazing scent of  their grill and hunger takes over   There is usually a line forming  but that s how good it is   I d wait an hour in line for the delicious good at Gaucho     I ordered  Pollo con Pan  or their chicken sandwich with onions  peppers  and so much flavor that you cannot stop eating it till it s gone    Hence why I  don t have a picture     Their Rosemary Beef Sandwich is also amazing     If you re going to the Strip and crave something delicious  stop at Gaucho   If you re not in the Strip  I suggest you go and try the amazing food at Gaucho    You can thank me later ,5,2014-04-26
Was the  hr wait in the cold and additional   hr kind wait to order worth it    I don t know to be honest    Maybe if you ve never had an south american Argentinian steak over a fire  I guess this place is a gem in terms of food diversity and culture in the area and is accessible by tourists on the strip as well  If I had my way  I d honestly recommend going there on a less busy time for maybe lunch  We saw lines already starting at  PM for dinner  Maybe a weekday instead of a weekend   They make fresh chimichurri which was delicious  We got the NY strip steak large plate each which comes with a side salad and grilled bread which was delicious to dip in the array of sauces    The steak was perfectly medium rare and they do cut your steak for you if you re not used to that     We also got the roasted cauliflower as well  I think overall the food was fresh  perfectly grilled  and the ambiance reminds me of a family style modern farm house esq place with an almost cafeteria feel I also loved all the local art support  Be aware that it will be noisy so don t expect your intimidate atmosphere   It is BYOB as well    Overall not a bad experience but I honestly don t think it was worth the wait ,4,2018-05-18
Very tasty  Love the baked corn  very sweet  and the chief told us no butter on it  just boiled in water and then on wood fire    First time tried the plate  a little too much for two  but after that you ll get to know which one u like the best    Owners invite us to join their every night after work drink beer and shot  and talk to one of the owners  very nice    Gaucho should be one of the must do s in Pittsburgh    ,5,2015-02-12
Str  fire  Need to go there if you re in town or haven t been yet  Courteous staff  reasonable prices  great food  Try all the sauces ,5,2015-09-23
My absolute favorite restaurant in Pgh  The service was quick  and the food was out of this world,5,2016-12-18
Absolutely perfect for meat lovers  This place has such a different vibe and even though it s always busy  the line moves super fast  I tried the ribeye and the beef and chicken empanadas  They were fantastic   I have always loved this place and wish I would of wrote a review sooner   Spent a nice evening alone with a great atmosphere and great food,5,2018-10-17
Yes the line speaks for itself    I don t care for the line    but the food is so delicious    There is definitely attention to details    Had about    different things here    all meats are well seasoned and aromatically open fire grilling    hmmm    Greens on the side are well dressed   Vegetables are nicely roasted   All sauces could literally be consumed with a spoon  kidding  of course    Staff is very engaging and hip    seems happy also     which is a nice environment to be in   The checkout and order line is a bit slow     Could use a business consultant to increase efficiency  ,5,2017-04-26
Went here and got one of the steak sandwiches  After all the reviews  my expectations were sky high  Cool environment right on the strip and staff is exactly as you d expect  friendly  helpful  and conversational  It was extremely hot outside but the restaurant held cool   The food was good but left a little to be desired  There is a sauce bar     at the front of the back room for you to combine different sauces for the entrees  My steak sandwich was a little tough  bread was piled high  etc  overall good meal  just didn t blow me away  I will probably go back and try a different sandwich ,4,2019-04-06
There is a line in front of the restaurant  But don t be scared  it shouldn t be that long  You need to order before you get seated  We order steak plate  carne sandwich and lasagna  We all think they are a little salty  I took a bite and drank some water afterwards  The restaurant is pretty big inside  Overall  good experience ,4,2018-12-08
My boyfriend kept raving to me about this place for sometime and I finally got to go any try it  First of all this is a nice little corner restaurant that is way bigger than it looks upon entering  You order from a menu that s written on a chalk board which can be a bit overwhelming especially if it s your first time there  Took me a while to figure out what everything was but they have awesome staff that was very willing to help you out  After you figure out your menu you order up front  get your drink  and then they seat you  We sat in the back which was a nice open spaced area  The place was busy but not to the point where we had to wait long at all  Also we found out that it is a B Y O B  establishment too   As for our dinner it was AMAZING  I was surprisingly impressed since all I kept hearing about was  how good their steak sandwiches are   Me and my boyfriend got small steak plates  I got the ribeye and he got the NY Strip  They both were to die for  They each come on a long wooden board with an individualized salad for what meat you get  Then along side is a grilled crusted piece of Italian bread  I swear I couldn t get it in my mouth fast enough lol  The ribeye was good but I preferred the NY Strip and it just melted in your mouth  Each meal was just enough and I didn t feel guilty of overeating to much  Also we got a side of Fungos which were pan roasted cremini mushrooms with shallots  rosemary and sherry wine vinegar  Who does like steak and mushrooms right  These were delicious and paired perfectly with our steak   I absolutely can not wait to get back here to try out other things  The food I watched come out of the kitchen as we were eating looked so good ,5,2017-02-03
This is an experience I would recommend  It s a tiny  tiny  TINY place at the edge of the Strip toward downtown  There are maybe   seats in the entire place  and at popular times  there are people lined up out the door  The reason they re all lined up is that the food is quite good  We had a rosemary braised beef sandwich and a gaucho salad  Both were quite good  The former was well seasoned and balanced by some cheese and grilled onion  The latter was a collection of a variety of veggies    The food isn t too cheap  but the quality is very high ,4,2014-12-31
Picked up for lunch  Steak sandwich was brilliant   Empanadas were okay  Prob won t order again  Overall would try again though  Shows potential ,3,2017-01-04
Just yes  everything yes  It was all delicious  The sides are as big of stars as the entrees  Also  the cookies were amazing too  A place like this  it s easy to focus on the meat and think you can get everything else somewhere else  I m  no  Just do yourself a favor and order everything  And in case you re thinking  my eyes are bigger than my stomach  no  you re stomach will just need to make room  Favorites included the steak burger  carrots  and the chix empanadas  Fair point pricing on everything  I d say pro tip  but it s more an obvious tip IMO  you want to try the four sauces that you pick up on your way to the table after ordering  Be prepared to pay probably wait a little to order due to lines out the door  but also be prepared for staff who are super friendly and helpful  Also  plan your visit accordingly  they are closed on Sundays and Mondays ,5,2019-06-12
My friends and I had a great visit to  Gaucho  this past weekend  This is one of the hottest food destinations in the Steel city  It s usually pack  but in this snowy day there was barely a wait   The wait staff were lovely  Helping the group choose some of their most popular items on the menu  Our group typically buys a bunch of food so that we can each sample  and this place is great for that  Offering small bites that pack a big punch    The food a great  All the meats were perfectly cooked  tender  and chalked full of flavor  My favorite item from this visit with the flank steak  followed by the beef empanadas   I also LOVE the pay up front aspect  Takes the complication out of splitting bills at the end of the meal ,5,2019-01-16
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh   Their steak  no matter what cut  is always perfectly cooked and flavorful   The food is definitely worth the wait   I don t really think you could go wrong with anything on the menu ,5,2017-02-09
I ve been a huge fan of gaucho even before they expanded to the building next door and waiting in line forever became common  I really like their meat and side dishes  They somehow always manage to arrange for big groups even though it s super crowded most of the time   I am not giving gaucho five stars  though  because they removed the most delicious grilled vegetales from their menu  They also seem to be experimenting with other dishes  The potatoes are not as good as they used to be   ,4,2016-11-06
Food was sub par dinning facilities were dirty and full of wood chips and dust employees while friendly were unprofessional the kitchen staff was drinking alcohol and eating food while food was being prepared witnessed one employee chewing tobacco and spitting in a cup at his workspace there was a mouse dropping under our table  Well now onto the food  i ordered a burger medium well with BLT and mayo and my wife ordered a vegetable sandwich  My burger came out drenched in mayonnaise and under cooked and I say that kindly  My wife s sandwich was sloppy and fell apart and she had to eat it with a fork  That being said we waited in line for about    minutes then waited to order another    because the dinning area was full eat here if you d like but I just don t see the reasoning behind the popularity ,1,2018-01-31
This place is absolutely gorgeous  We went to this place on a Saturday night  We ve been waiting in a line for about   mins  The mix steak sample   different steaks   oz for each  are awesome  The grilled shrimp is also great  The size of the salad is really big  The fish of the day was tilapia which is not very impressive  The service was excellent  Definitely will go back for the steak and desert,5,2015-10-02
Oh my goodness  If you love meat  this place is your Nirvana  Stopped in for a quick lunch while I was downtown  I m from out of town and had no clue where I was  Yelp hooked me up though  This place is so good    I had the rosemary beef sandwich with horseradish and a side salad  The side salad was mixed greens with roasted tomatoes and caramelized onions on it     seemed a little steep for the small salad  but it was tasty  so I m good with it    The sandwich was about the size of my head    and I have a large head  Seriously  if you can finish this sandwich in one sitting  congrats  Tons of beef and caramelized onions and horseradish  Simple and delicious    The best part is that you can try their homemade sauces and the chimichurri sauce is mind boggling  Garlic  cilantro  tons of herbs  vinegar    and some other stuff  I took a take home cup of it because I want it to be on everything I eat for the next few days  Seriously  super duper delicious    This place is for real  Don t get scared off by the       If you just go get a giant sandwich for      you are definitely getting your money s worth    For what it s worth  they also had some tasty looking veggie sandwich options too    Check this place out ,5,2015-01-27
My dad and I have heard lots of good reviews about this place so we decided to check it out today  We were told there is usually a long line so be prepared to wait  We arrived around     and there were only a few people in front of us which was awesome  The menu is huge and on a chalkboard wall right when you enter the restaurant  We played our order and were then seated in their upstairs dining area  Super friendly staff and an awesome environment   We ordered two sandwiches  a pulled pork and a steak  ribeye   Both were DELICIOUS  The pulled pork came with mustard  which I am not a huge fan of  but it worked well on the sandwich  The steak was tender and soft  making it amazing on a sandwich with peppers and onions  We also got a side of corn  which comes on the cob  Super juicy and yummy  Overall an awesome experience and would definitely go back  I want to try one of the steak or fish platters the next time  The couple next to us ordered them and they looked super ,5,2017-08-26
Amazing as always  In addition to great food  we brought along a bottle of wine  byob   The line to order and get seated can be a bit intimidating but it is well worth the wait ,5,2018-03-03
Gaucho may be one of the best hole in the wall places in Pittsburgh  It s tiny any serves of the best beef around  They re a Argentinian meat sandwich joint that s creating a quiet the buzz   They have a special spice blend on their meats of filet  ribeye  flank  skirt with sauces such as chimmichurri  The sandwiches come on a toasted chiabatta bread which is perfect for steak sandwiches     The wait is long if the weather is beautiful out  but I recommend calling ahead and getting it to go  That will let you avoid the line and get your food  This past Saturday it took   hour to wait in line  order and get our food    A Suggestion  Have   person dedicated to sending out food  There s   person doing everything from ringing up orders  refilling sauces  refilling forks  sending out food  This slows everything down and can be frustrating when the line is extremely long    Overall  can t wait to go back to this place  Wow ,5,2014-04-14
I was In Pittsburgh for a weekend and my hotel was within walking distance and it came recommended as a place for lunch that I could walk to  It was lunch time on a Saturday and was sort of busy  The gentleman working the front who seemed to be a manager was wearing a Cleveland Browns jersey and was very short with people and was rude  The menu looked good with the steaks but I chose chicken  I asked for my sandwich with no mushrooms or pickled onions and substitute those for caramelized onions instead  After waiting around    minutes to give that simple order it was wrong  The food was ok  I think it s overrated and over priced  The dude with the browns jersey should realize he s in the hospitality business and treat customers with more respect ,2,2019-09-28
I went here a few weeks ago  and had a great time  The wait was about    minutes  and the line went out of the door  so if you can t stand for long periods  then maybe Gaucho Parrilla isn t for you  However  they did take our order while we waited  So  by the time we sat down  it was only a few more minutes before our food arrived  It was delicious  and worth the wait ,5,2019-05-03
Incredible meat    And I love the street corn and all of the sides  I haven t been in a while and I can t wait to get back there  I m so happy to see that they have added more seating because it used to be really small with only a few stools  The sauces that they have to put on your food are out of this world  They were so good I had to take a couple to bring home with me   ,5,2016-05-04
Classic spot to feed your inner Carnivore  One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh  Great place for dates or groups  possibly even special occasions  i e  family dinner over graduation     My one annoyance is the loooong wait and cramped waiting area during busy times    The line will be outside wrapped around the corner  For example  Arrived on a Saturday at   PM and probably waited for an hour    They don t take reservations unfortunately  HOWEVER  if you re willing to wait it out  it s completely WORTH it    Gaucho delivers on the best beef  sauces  and other specialties  shrimp  pork  sides  etc   You can order plates or sandwiches  Seriously an overwhelming number of options  I ve found that for two people  ordering two small plates and a side  potatoes  green beans  etc  is the perfect size to split and leave with a full belly  I recently split the Cerdo  roast pork   small plate of NY strip  median rare   and side of potatoes   ALL delicious  The strip was perfectly pink   red  The pork wasn t dry but tender and flavorful  The Camarones  shrimp plate  and Carne Sandwich are both equally worthy  I have nothing negative to say in regards to the quality of food here  Out of the sauces  which are a must have regardless of your order   I obsess over the Ajo Garlic  roasted garlic  and classic Chimmichurri Yummy  Argentinian steak sauce    BYOB,5,2018-05-25
I always got the Asado Platter  Steak Platter  every time I went to Guacho previously  This time I decided to try something else and I was a bit disappointed    I got  Empanadas  Beef and Pork    both tasted weird  there are like smelly taste  Chory Pan   it was my new favorite at the place if I don t feel like order Asado Platter  Carne sandwich   we ordered our ribeyes Med rare  The steak came out dry and done  It would have taste so much better if it was not too done   Steam Mussels   the mussels is very good  The broth was perfect and not too soupy,3,2019-05-17
My husband and I went and there was a long line to get in but it wasn t a problem  The menu is very vegetarian friendly   The sauces are great  The bread for the sandwiches was a little thick  but the sandwiches tasted great  The flan was the best I ve ever had  and I hate flan   Great service  Would definitely go back again ,4,2019-05-25
Not only is the food amazing  but the staff are friendly and cool  Free flowing sauces as well  Rosemary Braised Beef Sammie with Horsey and Onions is my favorite ,5,2016-04-09
The food is good  but I m not sure it is quite worth the price and the wait when the dining area is so loud   The hard surfaces make it difficult to have a conversation when the restaurant is full ,4,2019-01-31
This is a BYOB establishment  The food was different yet not different  Menu is LARGE  Atmosphere is inviting and warm ,4,2019-03-14
What can I say that already hasn t been said  It s true  everyone loves Gaucho for a reason  It could be the atmosphere  it could be the food  it could be the incredibly friendly service  chefs  staff  anyone you end up meeting or cramming next to for lunch   If you eat meat  get some meat  If you don t eat meat  you have fantastic options  Regardless of your  possibly non  carnivorous preferences  get some corn  Honestly  you can t go wrong closing your eyes and just choosing anything on the menu at random  Come with a few more people and convince them you know what you re doing so you don t feel too guilty choosing more than one thing at random   What makes a great restaurant  I m not so sure  but I think Gaucho has it figured out  This is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh ,5,2015-07-01
Not thrilled at all  After a wait of    minutes approx  the food was burnt in parts  By burnt I mean charred black  The only good tasty thing I liked were the four kinds of sauce available here unlimited  Instead of forcing customers to stand in line may be a registry service would have been more convenient and time saving for the customers  The table service was nice  Not going back and won t recommend this place  I have been to other non over rated restaurants which serve better food with a similar menu,1,2018-09-23
I know I m going against the grain because most people seem to love this place  We found it to be a mixed bag  First of all  they have a unique way of handling customers   You wait in line to get to a counter and place your order and pay for your food and drinks  They then seat you  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly    I ordered the Skirt Steak  The small portion was      The large portion would have been      It was very flavorful   probably one of the better steaks I ve had  The small salad was good  but was tiny  I also got the beef soup  but it was too salty for my taste  My wife took it to go   My wife ordered the ribs  They had little meat and she found them dry  with little meat on the bone  Her ratatouille was flavorful and she thought that was the best part of the meal  It was too spicy for my taste   Clearly based upon the size of the crowd they are doing something right   though I thought that they were overpriced for what you got  The approach of having you order and pay at the counter before being seated results in long lines snaking out the door at peak times    I m glad we went  but it will probably be a while before we return ,3,2017-03-20
The food here is awesome  It is a very unique vibe  It brought me back to my days spent at the Beehive  It is an interesting setup  You go to the front counter and order your food and pay  Then  you go to your seat and they bring your food to your table  We had the mixta  which comes with steak  chicken and your choice of sweet or hot chorizo  We got the sweet  We also got an order of provoletta and pork empanadas  We got sides of yams  mushrooms and greens and beans  I did not eat the yams  so I won t comment on those  though my wife did love them  The mushrooms were fine  nothing spectacular  The greens and beans were very good  if you like garlic  which I do  The steak was great with a really nice char on it  which gave it a really nice and smoky flavor  The chicken was good  a little bland  But let me just talk a bit about the chorizo  I love good chorizo  This was among the best chorizo I have ever had  It was packed with flavor  The provoletta was awesome and I wish we had gotten a large versus a small  The empanadas were good  if not a little dry  which is fine  There is a self service bar to get dipping sauces  They are all great  It just depends on what you like  We got the bread pudding for dessert  which was incredible   The only thing that dings it for me is that if you want dessert  you have to rely on one of the waitstaff to get the dessert for you  which they will do  In which case you have to pay separately for that  My wife did make a good point that because they bring out all the food at the same time it does start to get cold  especially since the serve them on wooden plates  which is very pleasing  but it doesn t help retain heat  But once you are done  you can just leave and you are not waiting for your check ,4,2019-02-23
Best food we ve had in years   fantastic flank steak platter   the roasted squash   eggplant on point   the house sauces are amazing,5,2018-10-20
This place is a hidden gem in the strip district and always busy    I ve been here a few times and never leave hungry   The selection of meat especially the steaks is very extensive   They don t take reservations and you literally walk in order and grab a seat   The bread is delicious and recently they went from BYOB to offering beer to buy with your meal   This is one of my favorite dining spots in Pittsburgh   ,5,2019-11-24

Food  Great   Their meats and sauces are incredible  Hands down best Argentinean resturant in the city  Must try and definitely worth the wait  Bread pudding is delicious   Service  Excellent   Everyone is very attentive and prides themselves in serving  even the owner   Overall  Highly Recommend   If you re only In the city for a short time and want a memorable food experience  this should be the first place you try ,5,2018-07-15
Wow what an amazing meal   The steak was perfectly cooked and so flavorful   The sauces were delicious   The food makes up for the weird way you order and get seated but for food that good  I d swim across the Allegheny in January if they asked   If you love meat this place will give you the good type of meat sweats   Definitely will be going there more often ,5,2018-12-27
Friend and I spent the afternoon in The Strip and planned to wrap it up checking out Gaucho Parrilla   We thoroughly enjoyed our first outdoor meal of the season at about  pm on Saturday   The place is a meat haven and we had two wonderful sandwiches but we found the show stealer to be the PROVOLETTA   That would be grilled  aged provolone with thyme  oregano  olive oil and lemon   Such a show stopper that the table next to us  who had finished already  asked what it was and they started all over again   with their own order   Oh yes  and surprise   There was a small salad on the side   So  yes  the sandwiches were fab  but the provoletta was fab     Almost forgot   the outside seating is complete with the firewood supply  little wagon and all    how cool is THAT  ,5,2014-04-13
What more can possible be said about this place  It is simply delicious  I was so excited to try this based on all the amazing reviews here  and the only thing that disappointed me is that my boyfriend got to try here before me    It is such a small unique place  everything about it is interesting  The menu being on a huge chalkboard is super cool  although I have no idea how to pronounce most of the things on the menu properly  Makes for a good conversation    I have come here twice and shared food each time  Everything was so good  I highly recommend the corn on the cob and any of the tamales  Pick litterally anything on the menu and you will be a very happy person    Seriously if you have not been here please get in your car and go asap ,5,2014-12-17
I am usually that fool that doesn t end up going to places once there is so much hype about it but I have finally gone to Gaucho and I am proud to say that I am forever changed  I got the rosemary braised beef con pan and it was amazing    The sandwich was huge and the meat was delicious  However  what truly stole the show were the condiments  I ate all the chimi and pepper relishes and loved all of them    Everything was so bright and fresh tasting  I would never need another condiment in my life if I knew how to replicate one of these sauces  ,5,2016-05-16
I was only able to eat here once  because I was never able to get past the long lines  I still love the place   especially their chimichurri is to die for  My favorite was the filet mignon and ribeye  And not overly expensive ,5,2018-08-23
Came here on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch  Gaucho opens at      AM  and I arrived at        I was second in line  The staff was great  They were extremely friendly and helpful   For the food I ordered the Sirloin plate  and asked for medium rare  The meat was super tough to chew through which was disappointing but had great seasoning  I d recommend trying all of there sauces that compliment the steak  Besides the meat being tough to chew everything was amazing   Overall this place is a unique place for Pittsburgh and has a wide variety of Argentinian food  Dispite my meat being tough to chew through I will still return to try the rest of the menu due to the reputation of the restaurant for quality food  and quality customer service ,4,2019-07-02
All   times have been excellent dining experiences  Food is all so appetizing in its description on the menu  and in the finished product   The only bizarre part of dining there is at the counter where you order and prepay  they have a big tip jar  They provide minimal assistance in table service  if you want to go back and grab dessert  you have to get back in the long line and order it yourself   so how they ve earned a tip at time of prepayment  I have no idea  Pretty presumptuous ,5,2016-04-16
Gaucho did deliver  I ve been skeptical and find some of their signage off putting  Maybe I m getting too old or whatever    Anyway  despite them botching our order and totally forgetting one of our entrees  they did fix it on the fly and offered us a free dessert  So  in the end they did the right thing  The root cause ended up being a new  inexperienced person at the register printing out a bad duplicate ticket for the kitchen  So it was not the kitchen s error to begin with    So on to the food  it was absolutely delicious  I ve been thinking about that skirt steak since I ve had it  I ve even gone so far as to call around to butcher shops and ask if they sell skirt  turns out not everyone does     Let me review our order  an Argentino salad with medium rare flank  the grilled winter mushroom salad with medium rare skirt  along with a large order of the grilled shrimp  We ended up choosing the alfajores as our comped dessert    I just wrote about the Rainbow Salad last week at Kaya s and said that it was a salad I would go back for as a meal  Well I guess I have to add the grilled mushroom salad on to that short list as well  The oyster mushrooms were just flame kissed and the brussel sprouts were charred just enough to make the whole salad have a meaty flavor and texture even without a bite of steak  The steak itself was truly spectacular and made my dinner date jealous despite their flank steak being excellent as well    The Argentino salad was very good as well and got rave reviews by my date  The flank steak was cut into thick  meaty slices that were cooked perfectly    Finally  grilled shrimp were excellent  And for a dozen at      while not cheap  totally worth the extra protein   In the end  even the impromptu alfajores were delicious  And that coupled with the BYOB made it an absolutely perfect dinner  So  five stars it is  despite the wait ,5,2017-02-19
Best meal I ve had this year  maybe even ever    We had steak  empanadas  charcuterie  potatoes  salads  good lord we had a lot of food and it was all amazing  All the sauces were great  we particularly loved the red sauce   I m obviously very cultured and that s definitely the proper name for the sauce   You will probably have to wait in line but it is      worth it  I ll never go to Pittsburgh without going here ,5,2019-05-23
The hype is real folks  Read this review and get thee to Gaucho if you have not been there yet  Seriously  Don t wait  Do it   I split the Rosemary Braised Beef and the Carne Steak sandwich with a friend  GREAT idea because it was the best of both worlds  While I enjoyed the Rosemary Braised beef more  because I love horseradish and caramelized onions  the Carne Steak was just as good  The steak was so flavorful you didn t need anything else      Unless  you re into sauces like I am  I love sauce  They had four different kids of sauce on the table in the middle of the place  I wish I could tell you what every kind was  but all I know is that they were delicious  I just wanted to steal them and put them on everything I eat all the time    It s s small place  so beware you may have to do take out  but don t fear  they re looking to expand shortly and will hopefully offer dinner service and more   So get thee to Gaucho ASAP ,5,2014-03-31
I was PLANNING on taking a picture of my food  but the second I got it  I started cutting  I don t want to exaggerate because I love steak  but this was probably the best steak I ve ever had in my life  I had the sirloin and the potatoes and it was unbelievable  The steak was cooked perfectly  it was juicy  it was tender  it was flavorful  The potatoes were unbelievable as well  Don t listen to anyone who says anything other than   stars  The wait in the cold was abworth it    Second time back and somehow it was better than the first time  Can I just go ahead and give this place    stars ,5,2019-03-30
I loved my first experience in the newly expanded  well renowned Gaucho  I ordered the chicken sandwich  which came out on a toasty grilled ciabatta  crunchy on the outside  chewy on the inside   yummm   I was unaware chicken could taste that good  obviously I shared only under duress    My lunch partners ordered the skirt steak and the lamb rack  The skirt came out with an incredible marinade  with just the right preparation  an inspired performance  The lamb  while perfectly seasoned and cooked was the only reason for a star deduction  Compared to the other portions  which were huge  the lamb was a paltry   ribs and a tiny side salad  Perhaps they need to charge more and offer a larger amount of lamb  but we were very surprised by the notable difference in meat on that plate    The ambiance is changed from the joint s humble r  roots  and feels a bit more like the hip  buzzing restaurant it became  There is still a great view of the kitchen  and intimate seating  though you are no longer elbow to elbow with the next diner    In summary  We loved it  we ll absolutely be back  just not for the lamb ,4,2015-06-23
There is a reason that there is always a line out the door for this place   it s just that good  Gaucho is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh and one I always tell out of towners to try  I ve never had anything I disliked  My husband and I usually want to try multiple dishes so we get some sandwiches  empanadas and all the sauces and split it  We always leave with some for lunch the next day too  Definitely a spot to try  You won t be disappointed ,5,2019-04-30
First I called to get a pick up order and they said they don t do pick up orders   So we went there and ordered and it took    minutes to get our food it was cold and the service was terrible but I could see where the food would ve been good but I will never go back and you re a fool if there s any indication that they re busy and you go,1,2019-05-18
I mean   what is there not to love about Gaucho   This weekend we had guests from out of town visiting us and knew that we had to take them here  I was excited to come back because I haven t been here since it first opened a few years ago  I was impressed when I saw the amazing work that they had to the inside  We ended up getting here around      PM on a beautiful Saturday afternoon in PGH  The strip district was buzzing  so I was sure it would be packed here  Luckily  there was only about       people in line ahead of us and it seemed like the crowd followed us as we stood in line  We only ended up waiting about       minutes  which worked out great    When we finally got inside to see the menu  we were overwhelmed with the menu and how amazing everything sounded  We ended up deciding to order a few dishes to split between the   of us  this is a great idea if you are coming here with a group so you can get a taste of everything  We decided on an order of   each of the empanadas  vegetables  pork  and beef    side of potatoes  the Parrillada Mixta  NY strip steak  chicken  and spicy chorizo   and the vegetable sandwich  we ordered it deconstructed    Where do I even begin  Everything was mouth watering  The meats were all cooked to perfection and were accompanied by the fabulous self serving sauces that they have  You can tell that all the food is super fresh   it all has the perfect amount of char to give it a unique   delicious taste  The empanadas were all amazing and I loved to try the variety of them  They were unique from any other empanadas that I have had before  Even their bread is phenomenal   My ONLY complaint is that they got rid of the vegetable dish that was on their older menu  We ended up ordering the vegetable sandwich as a replacement but I didn t love it as much as the older vegetable dish  please bring it back     Aside from the fabulous food  the interior of Gaucho is also a winner  As I said before  the renovations that they have done in the last few years are outstanding  I love that they are able to fit more people inside and it is still super spacious and a comfortable environment  The staff is also helpful and very kind here  Most importantly    Gaucho is BYOB  I always love a good BYOB spot  I promise you  if you see a line here  stand it  and wait    it is so worth it  Can t wait to come back again ,5,2017-10-10
We got here just after   pm and got right in  The menu is on a huge chalkboard as you come in  Lots of good stuff to chose from  Every thing we had was great  Good service  great atmosphere   It s BYOB but that s ok   The sauces are really good too  We had a great time and great food   When your in Pittsburgh and in the strip district this is a must   ,5,2016-05-06
The food is really good  I love the seafood soup and the ribeye  The price is a bit high for the amount of food you get but it is worth it ,4,2016-03-05
Pre wedding weekend bliss with my soon to be bride  We shared the ribeye platter which was INCREDIBLE  We opted for the large    oz  which was plenty to feed us both  My girl is a meat fan  but one of the best things she put on her plate was the sun dried grilled tomatoes in the salad  We liked them so much we asked for extra  The ribeye was tender and flavorful and grilled to perfection  The smoked red pepper sauce was our personal favorite  but all of the sauces were fresh and flavorful  We also ordered the grilled pineapple with blackberries  mint  and creme fresh  My lady had never had grilled pineapple before but I can tell by her reaction she will have it again    I ve read some yelpers had long waits  I can see why there is a line out the door on most weekends  We came on a Thursday afternoon and maybe had a    minute wait to order then probably another    minutes for our food    The biggest applause should go to the staff  Super friendly and helpful  The cooks have a thankless job over a hot grill but are masterful at their jobs and produce a fantastic product    The best advice I can give is talk to Dillon when you get here  He was extremely helpful and professional  and clearly enjoys his work  Great customer service and I m already looking forward to our next trip to this gem ,5,2016-07-21
Outstanding food and service  The flavor profiles are out of this world  The wait isn t too long so don t be fool by the long line which is usually out the door    My favorite meal is the flank steak with a side of the small veggies and a glass of Guinness or red wine   btw It s also BYOB ,5,2017-03-03
This is easily the best restaurant in Pittsburgh  Do not let the long line steer you away  The wait is usually    minutes to an hour  but the time goes fast knowing you are about to enjoy some pretty amazing food  We ordered the Asado platter  which is   cuts of meat  It was     and well worth it  The meat was cooked perfectly and was so tender  We also tried the empanadas  cremini mushrooms  broccoli and butternut squash mash  Overall  everything we ordered was tasty    It is BYOB  but we were informed that at the end of October they will be charging a     corking fee  That is sill not bad compared to what you would pay elsewhere for a whole bottle of wine ,5,2019-10-20
Food still SO good  but Gaucho just got their liquor license  so while you can still BYOB  a     per bottle corkage fee makes it a different experience  My large group went last night and decided not to BYOB but instead experience their beverage program   Gaucho   get your act together or roll the new policy back until you do   First  the disorganization in how they serve booze has severely slowed table turnaround  We stood at the register when it was our turn to order for half an hour because all tables were full  We went at the same time we always have  about once a month for over a year  and we have never had to stand and wait like that for a table  We figured out why when people at our table wanted another glass of wine  Not having waitstaff means having runners who have to be flagged down every time someone wants another glass   they take the order  Then you wait  And wait  About    minutes later they bring your little carafe of wine  Then you have to give them your credit card to run  Then you have to sign for it  Lather  rinse  repeat  We probably ended up extending our time at our table about a half an hour longer than if we d BYOB   Second  you have a nice selection of spirits but virtually no mixers and no clue as to how to make even the most basic cocktails  And you don t even have a lime for a vodka tonic ,3,2019-11-07
Amazing service  Amazing food  Portions could be slightly larger but I still think it s worth the price ,5,2018-07-13
Amazing   The carne sandwich with ribeye as the meat option was delicious as well as the rosemary braised beef sandwich  Their vegetable side also awesome with a great smokey taste   The newly remodeled interior is beautiful and very inviting plus the BYOB option with no corkage fee adds extra bonus points ,5,2015-06-19
I couldn t believe there existed a restaurant with      reviews and   stars so I had to check this place out  Of course I decided to do this on one of coldest days of this year  Despite the tiny space  the guys working there made me feel at home  With so many options to decide  my friend and I got all the options we wanted  jamon serrano  the meat and veggie empanada  gaucho papas  and rosemary braised beef sandwich    My description of the food will never give it justice  I highly highly recommend the jamon serrano  All the components of the dish was picked out carefully to complement each other  I even took the left over goat cheese and picked onions and added to the rosemary braised beef sandwich  If you don t have time to sit down  the sandwich is your best option  Hearty and satisfying  it can even satiate a caveman  The meat and veggie emapanadas were seasoned well and the emapanada dough was flakey and buttery  I preferred the steak but I am also a meat lover so my preference is biased  The gaucho papas weren t anything special but served as a nice accompaniment to our meal    I think their sauces deserve a separate paragraph  One of their workers explained to me the ingredients in all of the four sauces  Their main ingredients for each are  onion  parsley  onion  and red pepper  The chimirri  parsley based sauced  was  my favorite for it s potent flavor followed by the garlic  red pepper  and onion  Their sauces are great companions for any of the dishes  I personally enjoyed the chimirri with the bread and red pepper sauce for the potatoes   Gaucho not only serves awesome food but is one of the few restaurants that have excellent service  The workers truly looked like they enjoyed their job and even offered my friend and I to warm ourselves up by their grill  Their antics along with the food makes Gaucho a must stop  You know I ll be there again ,5,2015-01-12
I had been eyeing this place since a brief trip over a year ago  but did not have time to wait in the line that wrapped around the block  Luckily  when I walked by most recently  there were only about    people waiting to get in  It was my lucky day   The menu had so many wonderful options that it was hard to choose  I ultimately went with the   oz  Vacio  sirloin plate  and it was amazing  I loved everything on that plate  from the fresh side salad  to the delicious toasted artisan bread  to the caramelized onions  and finally  to the star of the show   the steak  which was cooked medium as I ordered  with a nice char on the outside  There were a variety of sauces for the steak  but my favorite was the chimichurri sauce  It was nicely herby and garlicky  and its acidity complemented well with the steak    This platter was definitely a lot of food for one person  but I was so hungry that I finished it  For dessert  I tried some alfajores   one vanilla and one chocolate  I ve tried alfajores a few times before  and these were the best I ve had  I believe they make them fresh    The service was great   everyone on staff was so friendly and helpful  They really exuded warm Argentinian hospitality  With such great food and great vibes  I can definitely see why this is a crowd favorite in Pittsburgh ,5,2019-05-28
Can t say anything negative about this place  We went on a Saturday evening so a wait was expected  Line moved quickly  I ordered the parrillada mixta which was chicken  chorizo and ny strip  All the meat was tender and delicious  They had    dipping  sauces that really complimented the meat  Empanadas were delicious  but smaller than I expected  We left stuffed and had only eaten half of what we ordered  Will be returning here in the future ,5,2019-12-09
Great restaurant  Argentinian steak house  First time trying an Argentinian steak house  Got the ribeye  Was cooked well  Came with salad and a piece of toast  Chimicurri was a nice touch  There are different chimicurri flavors you can try like smoked pepper and garlic  Service was good and restaurant had a nice vibe  Would visit again and try something new ,4,2018-11-28
I ve only been able to go to Gaucho three times I think   It s a tough place to get in because everyone wants to eat there   The food is just so magical  It really is  I absolutely love the chicken sandwich and the roasted corn on the cob   If I could eat here on a daily basis believe you me I certainly would ,5,2019-01-11
This is honestly one of the best places in Pittsburgh  Well worth the wait and never disappoints ,5,2019-11-27
One of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh  We are here for few days and we got lucky the day was very nice and sunny  Long line in the restaurant but was well worth it,5,2016-02-20
There s already a million rave reviews on this place  but just in case you need another one to convince you to come here   please do visit this place if you re in Pittsburgh  There was a wait   it was a Friday night and I probably waited about    minutes  give or take  They seat you in order of the line rather than how many people are in your party   I ordered the sirloin steak plate with a side of mushrooms  Absolutely delicious  The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked  The mushrooms were so delicious  I also got the apple pie bread pudding dessert  I was under the impression they would bring out my dessert immediately after I finished my dinner  but it actually ended up being like a    minute wait between when I finished my dinner and when I got dessert  All of that being said  though  I m still giving a   star review so clearly that dessert was BOMB  It was SO good  I don t even like dessert and I loved that apple pie bread pudding   Do yourself a favor and go eat here ,5,2019-11-25
EDIT  This meal was from December  I was trying to add Gaucho to my BYOB list  and I realized I hadn t posted my draft   end  The hype is real    Ordered   Bife de Chorizo   NY Strip  rare Los Sprahts   Brussel Sprouts  sweet peppered bacon  and cider reduction Caldo del Mar   Mussels  clams  squid  fried capers  lemon  garlic  tomato  and a secret ingredient   My favorite part is that it s not ridiculously expensive  I recommend the steaks  and the brussels were really good  I was disappointed by the seafood  next time I ll just stick to the land meat    I ve looked through the many pictures  and I d want to come back and try the sandwiches too   The only downside or unimpressive part of Gaucho is that the eating area could be improved   it feels like a McD s dining room  Wobbly chairs and tables ,5,2016-06-09
I cannot add much more than already was stated  but here it goes   Waited in line for about    minutes to get in  but it was    degrees and it is February  so I did not care at all   Walking in  greeted by a large chalkboard with all the menu items that are available   Tons of options here and if you love meat options on your menu  then you came to right place   We ordered two small flank steak platters  recommended by a fellow yelper  along with   Empanadas    Beef    Chicken    Veggie    My steak was medium rare and was cooked perfectly   The other half got medium and she was quite pleased   The steak smells and tastes so darn good  lots of flavor   The empanadas were also really good   Nice and crisp  with flavorful  guts  on the inside   My favorite was the veggie  shocking for me  but it was spicy and tasty   The staff here  for as busy as they are  are quite upbeat  fun  and courteous   They really did a nice job   The food was delivered within a very reasonable time frame as well     Though a tad on the pricier side  it is absolutely worth it   It certainly has earned the praise it has gotten and it should continue to do so   Go  wait in line  order up and enjoy  all worth it ,5,2016-02-20
We went here for lunch   the food is absolutely amazing  Just the wood burning ovens emitting that beautiful smell of fire is nose happiness    It s a bit pricey but so worth it  I ordered the Chirozo sausage in spicy   sweet and the red skin taters  My mouth was tingling in it s most happiness  Even the roasted garlic was amazing to eat whole  It came with a few pieces of roasted garlic bread and it was so yummy    I highly recommend eating here   ,5,2019-11-08
Food gets   Stars as long as you like meat   However and not to be negative but line is long    hour with my    year old mother in law   They seem to cater to the young crowd only  No menu outside so people in line could have already decided  Too long to order ,5,2016-08-20

The steaks here are best in town     We had waited almost an hour to be seated but it was completely worth it  this place has waiting so make sure to arrive soon and u won t be disappointed as the food served is awesome  The sauces were real good  it s a must visit place and unique menu ,5,2019-02-21
This place in one word  Damn    I don t know how this food is so delicious  The spices  the cooking methods  the presentation  the atmosphere  the service  It s truly exceptional  We heard it was one of Pittsburgh s best restaurants  and I believe it  I enjoyed the casual atmosphere  but that the food tasted better than a  fancy  restaurant    It s in the Strip District  so you can walk around and visit all the other shops  which makes for a great date    I told my boyfriend that I was actually sad the meal was over  i e  All the food was gone    He got the huge steak plate with   different cuts of steak  The Ribeye was his favorite  I had the fish of the day on a deconstructed sandwich  which had the most amazing grilled onions and arugula with it    A little expensive compared to some places you could visit  but we ll worth it for the quality and flavor ,5,2018-11-01
I have to start by saying I did not like how they tell you to know what you want when you get to the counter  no menus outside so that you can figure that out  That almost made me pick a different restaurant   I don t like carrying my drinks to the table   And I don t like a TIP jar at the register   How do you know if you are going to TIP     before you have received service  But then I took my first bite   I am hooked   My husband and I ordered the empanadas  cauliflower  green beans  beef with rosemary  and the pork sandwich   We shared everything   Every single bite was delicious   It was way too much food for the two of us   But we managed to eat every bite   It was that good   I will definitely be a return customer ,5,2018-09-22
Not typical of an Argentinean restaurant but man was it some of the best meat I ve eaten   I had the rosemary braised beef Sammy and it was to die for   They have chimichurri  sauce and   others you can choose to add to your food  They were a grilled onion sauce  a red pepper and tomato sauce and a garlic sauce  The only one I didn t use was the pepper tomato sauce  The other three were an excellent addition  I also tried the vegi empanada which I wasn t fond of but I m an empanada snob so my expectations are high especially when you use the word empanada which shouldn t have been used here  It was more like a vegi turnover but if they called it that I would have never ordered it   The employees are so friendly and helpful  They had big smiles and that goes along way   The line was long but seemed to go fast  It was definitely worth the wait  The only thing I was disappointed in was the sides  They really could do better with the options   It was very unique that you could buy a bone for your dog for     Awesome way to keep from wasting them    I can t wait until the next time ,5,2016-10-23
If you are visiting Pittsburgh just add this to your list of restaurants you must eat at  Or if you live here and haven t dined here yet   get here ASAP  Just make sure you choose the time wisely  The hype is real and there will be a line  It does go fast though given the ordering set up    I ve dined at Gaucho twice now  The first time was in the summer when they had the shrimp and grilled veggies on the menu  This recent time I decided to get the carne sandwich and campfire yams  I have never ordered something I didn t like here  If you love yams  I highly recommend the campfire yams  I felt like I was out in the woods eating roasted marshmallows  Such a perfect fall dish  The sandwich was bigger than I expected which is why I cut it in half and made two meals out of it  You have your choice of meats and I picked the flank steak for my sandwich  Also  do not skip out on the sauces  They take your already delicious meal to the next level ,5,2018-10-28
There s a reason there is a line out the door of this place nearly every time you go there  Everything I ve had from Gaucho including veggies  potatoes  papas  and especially the meat has been absolutely wonderful  I m a person that usually goes for chicken over red meat  but order the steak here  you just have to  Their Chimichurri sauce is amazing  Another place you really can t go wrong with anything on the menu  Try to hit it this place on the off hours though there really aren t any ,5,2018-04-24
Wait was stupid long  hr   on a day that was raining like hell   Atmosphere was good   Staff was friendly   My steak was supposed to be medium  but came rare   It was very good overall  but not really worth a hr wait   Prices were very reasonable ,4,2017-04-29
This was my first time here  Since I have moved from Pittsburgh they have definitely done an amazing upgrade to its foodie scene and this place fits right in  If you come here though you are most likely going to have to wait in a long line that usually goes fast  that s if their POS system doesn t go down like it did tonight  that was the only down fall lol they said last time it was down for   hours  We waited for    min but the food is definitely worth it  They have flavorful selections cuts of steak cooked to your liking  I chose the steak medium well and it wasn t over cooked and was tender  They have difference sauces you can use to put on your food  My favorite was the garlic one  I also got the roasted vegetables with a fig dressing that was very good  And the peanut butter bread pudding was a perfect ending  It wasn t too sweet and very soft ,4,2016-09-03
Gaucho s meat sex shop is a MUST   I mean  this place was voted in a top ten spot on some national foodie list  I really don t feel like googling what list right now    And you might be thinking   well  I don t know  how good could a little local Pittsburgh area steak shop actually be   Why don t I just go to some chain restaurant that I know can cook the BEST filet mignon   with butter     well    Gaucho s is much much different  my friend    I think Gaucho is actually from Argentina   He must be  because I never tasted flavor like this in my LIFE   Whatever his prep process is from his meats  it s      grade prime material  Really talented stuff this guy does     On separate occasions I ve stopped by Gaucho s   Expect to wait  the line is usually out the door   even after he expanded his little stand up shop into a sit down  libation serving restaurant   All of my trips to this joint consisted of me ordering his steak sandwich for lunch  You can order straight up steak plates but for the    I ll save that for a dinner some other time    I mentioned he runs a meat sex shop  because his sandwiches are created as if they were put together in such a place  He combines the perfect amount of steak juice bread combination you could ever want in your mouth ,5,2016-02-21
I m newish to the area and have driven by a few times  it s hard to miss the line wrapped around the building so I figured I needed to see what the fuss was all about   First  this place smells amazing   Seriously  waiting in line isn t even bad because you just get to take in all the free smells   It will make you more hungry than when you arrived though    Second  the man that took my order was great   I believe his name was Patrick   Extremely knowledgeable and professional while maintaining efficiency with the line and keeping his cool   I m a district manager  so I know and appreciate good service when I see it   I d love to have this guy on my team         would recommend ,5,2018-12-16
My favorite eatery in the Burgh  Delicious  Argentinean fare  no pretension  long waits  and totally worth it    Everything is fresh  seasoned perfectly  and their chimichurri and other sauces taste like the meaning of life ,5,2017-12-27
Visiting from Orlando  FL  Very cute little counter order service Argentina restaurant  You need to make sure you are ready to stand in line  The line sometimes loops down and around the building   Ordered the porky emapana  it has chicken and pork stuffed inside  Ribeye Carne Steak sandwich with onions and red peppers   Corn on the Cob   And my favorite dish  QUI QUI chicky  two legs  two thighs with an awesome quiquirimichi sauce on it  The chicken practically melted in my mouth   All that with a Mexican coke only cost     ,4,2017-07-15
Awesome food  worth the wait in line  I have eaten here a handful of times and definitely will go back ,5,2018-04-27
The hype is real   I think I just ate one of the best sandwiches  The Carne  I ve ever had in my entire life   SUPER friendly and FUN staff   Great menu  Generous portions   Incredibly delicious food   The place is a small  meat Mecca     It offers relatively confined indoor seating or a charming  street side patio right next to the place   Plus  they effortlessly handled an ever growing line of hungry customers quite quickly    Gaucho is instantly on my  favorites  list  as I can t wait to be a return customer   Believe the hype     Star  Rock Stars  ,5,2014-05-25
My favorite dream is when I eat    of these steak sandwiches covered in every sauce ,5,2014-06-23
Awesome   The lines around the corner tell the story  great Argentinian grilled meats  and everything to go with them   Nice bright space in a building that sat empty for too long   Can t wait to go back ,4,2015-09-21
I have been hearing about Gaucho s for the past   years but only recently had an opportunity to go there   Wow   It was delicious   I had the fish sandwich and then  a week later  had the steak sandwich   This is definitely in my top   go to places for anyone visiting Pittsuburgh ,5,2016-09-04
Very rude customer service and not accommodating to serve me  The restaurant closes at  pm during the week  I showed up at the restaurant at    pm and was refused service with only   people in line ahead of me and I was a single eater  I talked with one of the employees and she said that I could not be served  I even offered to take it to go  Please do not waste your time with customer service such as this  I had been waiting for about   months to get off of work in time to try this place out  Never again ,1,2018-06-07
A line out the door and around the corner on a Thursday    I think it took me around    minutes to get in and get my food  so it wasn t too bad of a wait   I got the carne con pan   It was good  but a tad smaller than I expected it to be     Wish I could ve tried more food ,4,2016-07-24
Ok  I do really really like this place  food is fantastic    been there I bunch of times   But      They do need to work on the experience    I can accept waiting outside in the rain because they have nowhere for customers to wait  and I can accept setting my own table once you claim one    Last night my wife and I made the trip into the city to hit one of our goto places  we arrived at      to a pretty short line  great right   Nope  the poor schmuck at the end of the line had the unpleasant job of telling anyone who comes in the he was the end of the line while holding a giant end of line sign   Really   it s      and they  advertise closing at     I found the whole thing just stupid   Now it s late and we have to find somewhere else to go    I get this is one of those places who s thing is all about the food that you can t get anywhere else   it grew out of that self serve concept which is kind of cool the first few times    Now it s annoying   BTW our flank steak with chimichurri with red beans and farofa recipe is pretty awesome    Look out  haha ,3,2016-08-19
Best meat   great service staff  Love their attitudes  Decor is comfy ,5,2018-02-15
I love Gaucho   Whether for lunch or a special event  they have been fabulous   I only wish that they were open   days a week ,5,2017-01-22
My boyfriend ordered the mixed grill which had the pulled chicken  chorizo  and New York strip steak   I ordered the grilled shrimp   Food is freakin delicious and You need to eat here  Seating is weird but who cares when the food is freakin awesome and the people who work there are sweet as pie ,5,2015-06-20
Go here immediately     The meats are amazing  They are cooked to perfection  Make sure to get a cup of each sauce so you can dip your meat and bread into it  The grilled corn was so good  I tried the filet and flank steak and they were full of flavor  I don t think that you could make a bad decision when ordering from here   There is a reason this place had five stars  I am craving it like crazy ,5,2013-09-25
 HIGHLY RECOMMEND  Especially for steak lovers    This was rated one of the top    places to eat in the US according to Yelp a few years ago  Many people raved about it and I knew I had to try it out  I went here to celebrate one of my friend s birthday on a weekend  We were forewarned about the line and had to wait in line for about an hour  But was it worth it  YES  Everything was under     and for the amount and quality you get  it was definitely at a good price point  Service was great  The waiter gave us free dessert because he overheard us say it was our friend s birthday  I would go back again and try their famous paella that can feed like a whole family    DINNER   We ordered   steak platters  one fish platter    appetizer  and rosemary pulled pork sandwich  The rosemary pulled pork sandwich was sooo gooodd  It was juicy and fragrant  The steaks were all perfectly medium rare  and comes with a side of bread and salad  There were different dipping sauces to dip the steak in  The fish was tender  The yellow rice was standard and the corn was okay  Since this place is known for the steak  it definitely did not disappoint    We ordered banana bread pudding and we got free cookies from the waiter  The bread pudding was good  but a bit too sweet for my liking  However my friend thought it was  life changing  ,5,2018-11-10
The food and wait staff were excellent but the experience was more than puzzling frustrating  The MENU BOARD NEEDS TO GO  It s a cluster     of confusion  You are standing in a TINY little space trying to read this massive handwritten menu that is all OVER the place while people behind you hover  The ambiance is LOUD and hurried  My party barely talked to each other because no one could hear anything  So  Food A     Experience D   Get it to go and you ll probably love it ,2,2017-07-27
I realized I ve been too liberal with my star rating  From now on  my mind has to be blown to get a   star review  Gaucho Parilla wasn t mind blowing but the food was OUT DANG STANDING   I took my fianc  there for his birthday last night and WOW   What a different experience  I got a steak burger  I m not sure what his entree was  and we got empanadas  Everything was so good  especially my steak burger  That was a GREAT burger  Downsides   it was a little bit intimidating for an introvert like myself  You walk in  stand in line and order and pay for your food right away  Then you find a table yourself and your food is brought to you by some waiter coming into the dining room and yelling your name  I didn t like this  I want to be seated  have a waiter and a menu  But that s just my personal preference  I ll go back for the food ,4,2015-11-14
Smoky  meaty  authentic food   Really amazing cuisine served up by a friendly staff   I had the steak sandwich  rib eye  with potatoes   There are only about   seats inside but also some tables on the outside   The decor is nothing fancy  but the food is the real deal  I would give them   stars  but I had a half hour wait in line  then a    minute wait for my food ,4,2014-04-12
We love it   I have tried to find fault  but the food is consistent  the chimmi is flavorful  fresh and free  the settings is clean and casual     I am usually frustrated with how stodgy Pittsburgh is when it comes to convention and I m glad to see Gaucho break with the typical   sit down and wait an hour for your food  routine   As in Nashville and other foodie cities  you line up at the counter  with a large printed menu on the wall to look at as you wait  then you place your order and choose your own seat   They ll hand you your drinks on the spot and bring your food out when it s ready and usually  that s not too long   I gave it   stars because the food is as good as it gets  but there is one notable flaw  The line is insanely long    I wouldn t say Gaucho is to blame for such a long line  other than producing a hit restaurant  but they generally have exactly   person working the line ringing people up even if nearly     people are waiting  Sometimes the same person gets all the drinks  takes all the orders  and rings each person up   If a party of   pays separately and asks questions about the menu or for recommendations  you might wait    minutes for one table of people to place an order   This makes the wait longer than necessary  even with Gaucho s great popularity  I can t think of another business where that flies     I can see that if they had more than one register  there might not be enough tables  but we ve never been forced out without a seat but we have waited for over an hour to place our order      Keep up the excellent food  Gaucho   You ve already broken with tradition  but tweaking the way you take orders is in order   No restaurant  no matter how lauded  is guaranteed permanent success and it s always a good move to consider your customers first ,5,2016-05-06
I was shocked to see how much the place has changed since the last time I was here  It is way more spacious and I really liked the ambiance  The food is still as delicious as the first time I had it  Their chimichurri and garlic sauce are amazing  I usually get the carne sandwich   Fillet mignon  with papas and a beef empanada ,5,2018-11-08
Best steak experience I ve had in a long time  A little bit of a wait  but worth it as the atmosphere more than makes up for it  Would go again ,5,2016-05-25
Still   stars  This is our favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh hands down  I tried one of their salads with sirloin on it and it was the best salad I ve ever had in my life  I was this close  to licking the bowl clean  Can t wait to come back and try more of their food  AMAZE BALLS,5,2018-01-09
There s likely to be a line  and you ll wait while smelling some of the grill scents and watching happy people leave the restaurant  Around   PM on a weekend  we waited about       minutes  Once inside  you get to see the full menu   by that point I was so hungry I wanted everything  We got lamb and shrimp plus a large side of vegetables   I was surprised  The food was uniformly perfectly cooked  The shrimp were juicy  the lamb was tender and the vegetables were perfectly smokey yet still crispy  We cleaned our plates   The staff was friendly and helpful despite the constant crowd  the food came out reasonably quick  and the variety of seating makes it a social environment  Gaucho is a must try on any trip to Pittsburgh ,5,2016-04-08
If you like waiting in line for an iPhone this is about the same experience with no phone at the end   just some tired feet   The key which I didn t know but know now is to just be rude and push past the line saying a friend is already inside  This happened to me tonight and I ll never go back   I waited here for almost   hours and I had one Guy in front of me   then his   friends show up and I let it slide thinking ok he saved a spot for his friends but yeah   of them all Pitt students   So I let it go and the line slowly moves and right before I got inside a lady and her kid come around the bend and pushed right in   then I didn t make it in the door and they shut the door on me    and no this kid wasn t young or crippled or in any way shape and form couldn t wait the dang   hours i had to wait   another    minutes of me waiting went by all the time I see the lady and kid go to the counter now to order   finally I wised up and went to Kuhn s and bought my own flank steak for   dollars and   dollars of seasoning   People are probably still waiting in line there now and I already ate   This place has by far the worst system I ve ever seen for a restaurant   Next time I ll know to fake throwing up and just run inside   Anywhere else it would probably have lots of fights from the poor queue system,1,2018-10-28
Stopped by for lunch  Amazing quality and flavor for such a quick meal  Choice of four sauces which were delicious  Cool atmosphere as well  This place should be a role model for the burgeoning Pittsburgh foodie scene ,5,2015-09-22
We ate at Gaucho s today for lunch when visiting the strip district in Pittsburgh for the first time  This place had good yelp reviews   The reviews were right    There were plenty of vegetarian options  I ordered the provolone toast and charred brocollini and would def order again  My friend enjoyed the veg soup and a big salad   The staff were all terrific and decor was fun  Hope to eat here again on my next visit ,5,2018-02-21
I couldn t help noticing that I was the only female in line on a busy Friday lunch hour   I guess it makes some sense since this is place is known for their steak sandwich and men love their meat     Since I m not much of a beef eater  I went with the small plate of shrimp  carones  and the potatoes  papas    The shrimp and potatoes were lightly seasoned but you could definitely taste the fire grilled taste   YUM   I m a big fan of grilled food so this is a place to keep in mind when you have a craving for some fired food   They do have a selection of sauces and I got to try a few of them  can t remember the names    the one I liked the best had cilantro and chillies   it was also the one that was nearly done so it must be popular     Next time I go  I d like to try the grilled veggie sandwich ,4,2014-06-09
Delicious  Based on the staff recommendation  I had the steak sandwich with filet minion  It was fabulous  Very well seasoned and the bread was soft without being all soggy  I also love that the sauces are available separately because I m a spice a phobe  but my boyfriend isn t  so we can both be happy  The sides were also excellent  The grilled corn they had in the summer was great  but every side I ve tried has been good   I was tempted to deduct a star for the lack of seating  but the food is just too good  Just be ready to eat it standing up  This place is tiny  It is better in the summer when they have the outdoor seating available ,5,2014-03-11
I gave the place             and will look at the place from   different perspectives      Food quality        it is by far one of the best pieces of steak I have ever eaten  Juicy  tender  well cook and seasoned to perfection  Similar to the steak you will get in a good restaurant in Buenos Aires       Place        it is small and there is not enough space to sit  You can always order your food to go BUT it will get cold by the time you get home  Not setup for a large family or group of friends      Service        we waited for at least    min before the steak arrived and there was only   parties waiting  I was getting pretty hungry and antsy and the salad was not helping       Price        It is overprice  The price you pay in a restaurant is not only for the food quality but also for the comfort and atmosphere  and the service  I did not mind the tag because the food was awesome      Parking        the place is located in the strip district and has not private parking  Therefore  eating there requires a bit of planning  a bit of driving around  or a bit of walking   In summary  a GREAT place to eat AWESOME meat if you don t mind the parking  the small place  and the big price tag ,3,2015-05-23
You cannot believe your own heart  You cannot deny your own mind  You cannot free yourself From the memory Of beef Of beef like this Between two pieces Of bread Like ass cheeks  Of salted yeast  Tender as starlight  Real as a circus animal s desertion Savoury as the last drop of sweat released  expunged in a faraway land  still clinging to your sunbeaten brow  You gaze at the vast endless new territory Of the rest of your life  You have arrived    but can you leave ,5,2017-05-18
Came for lunch around      and waited maybe    min  when they took our order the line was around the corner  So we came at good time  We had the braised beef sandwich and ribeye steak  and grilled sweet corn  All delicious  The salads looked amazing  I d love it they had seating outside or rooftop  Cool place  but felt a little rushed  Service was good  nice staff,5,2019-05-08
Going to Guacho was such a fun experience  The food was phenomenal and the fast paced environment gave it such a lively feel  I ordered the Vacio sirloin plate  the meat was cooked perfectly medium well  It came with a salad and piece of toast   the toast was amazing  The salad needed more dressing so I added the garlic sauce into it  They have stations where you can get the sauce from in little cups  The Papas Al Horno potatoes were good as well  the garlic and rosemary were a great addition  I added the pepper sauce to them and it was amazing  My brother got the Catch of the Day Atlantic Salmon Pescado sandwhich and it tasted freshly made  and caught   Overall I loved the experience of Argentinian food as well as the fast paced Pittsburgh vibes the restaurant gave ,4,2019-11-27
Great little restaurant if you like Argentinian food  the quality of the food is sublime and the sandwitches have fresh bread  Alot of sauces to choose from and the dishes are pretty unique if you are unfamiliar with Argentinian food  I would start with a couple different steak sandwiches and work my way through the menu   FYI the lines here can get alittle ridiculous  especially during dinner time so go a couple hours before to prevent standing in line for    mins  Although the wait is worth it ,4,2018-06-16
What are you waiting for  Eat here already   The steakburger may be the best burger patty you ever have  It comes on a big crunchy brioche bun which at first I thought was too much bread  but upon further reflection and analysis  I must conclude that a mere mortal burger bun would crumble and disintegrate against this burger s juiciness      Tip  Come early on a weeknight  Like right after work  Do not attempt to come here on Friday  Saturday  or Sunday  It s too small a place to serve all the people who want to eat here ,5,2015-12-03
Delicious   Everything we ordered left us wanting more   It does take a little bit of time to get your food once you order  but the quality is well worth it   The staff was very attentive  and the employee who took our order took the time to explain all of the sauces and package up a container of each for us to try   He even told us a little bit about the origin of the restaurant and mentioned that they had converted their small parking lot into a little bit of outdoor seating   Definitely make the stop ,5,2013-06-16
If you re in Pittsburgh for any numerous reasons  you HAVE to come here  The lines can get long but with great company and BYOB  it goes by quickly  My friends and I have all heard stellar reviews of this place and they re all wholly valid  We ordered a variety of things off the menu but we left wishing we had more stomach to try everything else  Basically can t go wrong  ,5,2018-04-02
This might be my new favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh  It is a meat place and I am vegetarian and it is actually fantastic  You have to order your food at the counter when you get there and have your entire party before you can be seated  This is efficient since there is typically a line  The menu is large and has many vegetarian options  I ordered the small Provoletta and the broccolini with a cold yerba mate  Both were so  so good that I wanted to get back in line and get more once I was finished  The service was good and the place is clean and lively  An definite stop while in Pittsburgh ,5,2019-10-14
Everyone s crazy about this place  I like the atmosphere  and they have some nice outdoor seating for the summer  but every time I ve gotten a sandwich  it was so greasy  The quality of the food is pretty good  but the line is always so long for something I m not truly crazy about ,3,2016-11-07
I finally ate at Gaucho Parrilla Argentina  We showed up around   PM on a Saturday  We stood in line for about    minutes  but we were lucky enough to get one of the last available tables  I ordered a flank steak  which was cooked medium as I had requested and was quite tasty  My husband ordered the Parrillada Mixto  NY Strip steak  grilled chicken  and chorizo  and said that it could have had a bit more flavor  My side of potatoes also needed a bit more seasoning ,4,2019-11-24
Okay okay    I m glad I came back here  well I didn t really come back  I made a coworker bring me back something for lunch  I got the rosemary braised beef sandwich and it was really out of this world  Large sandwich  tons of meat  a perfect balance of flavor  I didn t have to deal with the ambiance which probably helps my review  Solid A ,4,2016-05-27
The food here is great   Don t let the line scare you  well worth the wait   We enjoyed the flank steak  the NY strip and the pig and pickles  various picked veggies with roasted pork and a yummy aoili      The ear of corn was cooked to perfection and seasoned wonderfully   The steaks were grilled nicely and full of flavor   We also tried the grilled wings  which easily could have been the best wings this eater has ever enjoyed   Oh   and there sauces  the traditional chimichurri and   others    the garlic one was awesome   You wont be mad or diappointed if you stand in line   This place does not disappoint ,5,2016-07-09
One of Pittsburgh s most talked about spots did not disappoint at all  We went for a date Friday night around      and did not have to wait at all  We split a chorizo  chicken  and steak dish  Plus we ordered potatoes and shrimp  It was the perfect portion for us to split  My favorite was definitely the chorizo and then the shrimp  But everything was great  Their meat is cooked perfectly with delicious sauces to accompany them  The garlic butter sauce was heavenly  We were certainly satisfied with our experience and will be back again ,5,2019-06-16
Worst service and host please do not go to this restaurant  They are liars and trash  Have no representation of Argentinian culture or people   Please spit on them  ,1,2019-09-14
I was sold on this place the minute I walked in the door and was greeted by the heavenly aroma of grilled meats   If I had it to do all over again  I would order differently  but this place is awesome    I ordered the skirt steak sandwich  the grilled corn  and the fried potatoes   All were absolutely delicious      So why would I order differently   One   because I d want to try more stuff    But mostly because I ordered way too much food and I d prefer something a little easier to eat    The sandwich was great   Flavorful  and nicely commplimented by charred red peppers and onions    The ciabatta bread was a nice choice  but skirt steak is a tougher cut  which perhaps would have been better in a non sandwich form    It was tasty  but really hard to eat    Next time  I would order the filet or something that is a little more tender   or get it in a salad or something    The corn was served with the folded back husk as a handle    Would absolutely order that again   The potatoes were also good  but completely unnecessary   The sandwich and the corn were more than enough     Overall  this place is a winner   Not good for groups  since it is tiny   Maybe six seats inside and eight tables outside    Staff members weree super friendly and took the time to explain everything   including the four complimentary sauces  all of which were good  ,5,2014-06-13
Walked in there with our own craft beer  the rib eye was sooo good  Every thing like the empanadas and the dessert were great  Is totally recommend this place to anyone looking to try out a legit Argentinian place ,5,2018-05-26
A definite go to place  The people who work there are friendly  You can take them beer or wine to show thanks or just for yourself  My go to favorite is the Carne sandwich with NY Strip  I love   of the   sauces   the one that kinda looks like mucous is the one I leave behind    I ve never heard any complaints from friends about everything else on the menu  Whether you eat in or get it to go  it s a great choice ,4,2016-03-04
Steak sampler was disappointing   Every cut of meat tasted the same  All the meat was  blue    I understand rare but this was flat raw   I ll give it another chance in the future because I ve heard many good things   My experience was a let down ,2,2017-09-30
Always an amazing experience with fantastic food  Sad bc they were out of filet mignon but can t complain much  Nice people wonderful experience and the most excellent quality food,5,2019-01-20
Meat cooked perfectly  service was excellent  we went here for lunch but I wish we would ve came for dinner so I could order ten Million more things   so flavorful  I definitely agree with this rating   The sauces were SO good too  I understand now why they sell them by the jar ,5,2019-04-06
So glad they expanding this fabulous little place to get great food  Everything I ve had here is tasty tasty tasty    ,4,2015-09-14
So amaziiiiiiiing    We came full and this was only supposed to be a snack pitstop and the   of us ended up demolishing our plates     The seating is a little intimate but get all   sauces and find an empty space and get ready to chow down   The staff is a hoot and even if they poke fun at you  they add to the experience    definitely make this a regular if you live here and make this a stop if you re visiting ,5,2014-11-23
Exceeded my expectations   Had the Ribeye medium rare and it was excellent   The beef and pork empanadas were also very good  I especially liked the pork   We also had the mushrooms  spaghetti squash and sweet potatoes as sides all of which were nicely done     The sauces are excellent as well   I really like the red version      Preserved the gaucho salad and it wasn t much more than the salad that already came with the steak   It was just a couple extra beets and some avocado   If you already have a house salad with your meal I would do other sides over this     Great place   Be prepared for a wait ,5,2019-03-31
The food here is a   so I ll start with that    We started with the picada  which was a huge portion for an appetizer  It was enough for my husband and I to have it as an appetizer for two days  The picada included Serrano ham  Iberico Chorizo  provolone  cabrales  which is another word for amazing blue cheese   dulce de membrillo  which is another name for pear paste   I don t like pear  but thought it was tasty   marinated olives  green and kalamata type olives   toasted almonds and ciabatta toast  We love charcuterie plates and this was by far the best    Next we shared the carne sandwich with flank steak  Originally  we were going to get either sirloin or skirt steak  Then I asked which steak would be the most tender and flavorful  A man who worked there said the flank steak would be the best for what I described  So happy we took his recommendation  It was delicious and made even better when I added chimichurri and some of the cabrales  blue cheese  from the picada  Absolutely delicious  We d order both again in a heartbeat    Now to the reason why I gave them   star less  Their ordering system is a disaster  There is always one person on the register who barely wants to be there  There may or may not be someone else there watching the giant line but not jumping on the second register  Then there is a girl giving out drinks  I think her time would be better spent on the second register ringing people up  There was a woman who took you to your table  Again this seems silly  Why can t she ring the second register and let people find their own seats  There were lots of them  It would be so much better if they just had table service  Then there is the crazy list of rules outside    If you can deal with the dumb ordering process and waiting forever to get to the one person ringing the register  the food is so worth it    You can also call ahead and come in for takeout  You can t eat there after though ,4,2017-04-30
Yeah  I know what you re thinking    stars for Gaucho Parrilla Argentina  You re CRAZY     That actually may be a true statement about me  since my mother has never had me tested  But nevertheless  I did not enjoy the charred  ashy flavor of their meats  particularly the ribeye steak sandwich   I didn t add any additional toppings  which might have helped   but I wanted to taste the purity of the meat  Also  the ratio of meat to veggies was ridiculously lopsided with thick cut roasted veggies being probably     of the sandwich  Considering the cost of the sandwich  I would have expected more meat   Although I liked the burger much more  I was not a fan of the hard breads they use to compliment their sandwiches  I also did not enjoy the strong flavor of the roasted potatoes and the beef empanadas were just okay    My tweenage kids took a bite and refused to eat any more of their food  They have a serious dislike for anything that has a burnt flavor and I honestly couldn t argue with them  I love a decent char  but today it was like eating cigarette butts from an ashtray  I felt so bad because I really hyped this place up to them after reading reviews and getting recommendations prior to my visit  So I took them down the street for a bowl of pho to make amends  Another visit may yield a better result  but as a first time experience goes  the food did not live up to the hype  The restaurant itself  the decor and the staff on the other had were awesome  What an eclectic collection of humans     FINAL THOUGHTS  This place came highly recommended  which makes me dread writing this review  I definitely don t want this to be a slap in the face to all the awesome yelpers who suggested Gaucho as THEE place to visit for my one day trip to Pittsburgh  but I gotta be honest  Besides  there are so many positive reviews here that I doubt mine will even be noticed    Ribeye steak sandwich       stars  Beef Empanada    stars  SteakBurger    stars  Roasted potatoes    star  Decor staff    stars          ,3,2016-05-24
Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is my favorite place to eat and dine  Very recommending,5,2019-12-11
This place was legit  A group of us decided to venture to Pittsburgh and choose this place for dinner   It s situated in downtown and fairly easy to spot  Arrived at  pm and there was already a small line  We ordered  Grill shrimp Empanadas Halibut  fish of the day  Asado Platter Apple bread pudding   The Asado platter was cooked to very well to our desired med rare with a good amount of meat for   men    Only comment is the sauces couldve been better and the bread pudding was bur a bit dry ,5,2019-11-09
always perfect  friendly staff  excellent food  wish I could go more often  I d give   stars  but the lack of table service hurts ,4,2017-05-17
The food is delicious  as good as it gets   The set up  trying to get a table can be a little taxing   We had seven and all the tables and counters were taken and it did not look like any table was ready to leave so we shared a little table on the patio and were offered a few extra seats from a couple of other tables  We shared the NY strip  ribeye  flank steak  veggie platter  potatoes  corn pudding and shrimp  and pork   All very good  cooked perfectly and with a nice wood smoke flavor    The four condiments were good on everything and are made in house   BYOb and enjoy ,5,2015-08-28
An ok place when there s nothing else around   In the midst of the city so parking is at a premium   Decent sandwiches and small plates   Very accommodating service as we had a wheelchair bound person with us  Long lines and limited seating though   BYOB ,3,2018-07-04
It may have been because of all the positive reviews  but I expected much more from Gaucho Parilla than it delivered  Don t get me wrong  the food was great  but not amazing    I came here with my brother at what I thought would ve been at an off time  It was neither lunch nor dinner  right around     pm  yet  there was still a long line outside the small entry way  Mind you  Pittsburgh had just received about a foot of snow the night before so most of the streets were empty  however  Gaucho Parilla must be doing something right for it to still have its patrons wanting it when it s freezing outside    It being our first time here  and seeing how busy it was  We could only imagine it to be worth the wait  The prices were a little on the steeper end  but I wanted to try a little bit of everything so we shared the Parrillada Mixta  NY Strip steak  grilled chicken boob and spicy chorizo with   pieces of toast   an order of the beef empanadas  and a small El Gaucho salad    The steak was prepared at a perfect medium rare and was delicious  The chicken boob  sic  was juicy and paired perfectly with the Pimenton Red Pepper sauce  The spicy chorizo was also very tasty  The portion sizes weren t too large and honestly was the perfect amount of food    The beef empanadas are highly recommended  The outer crust is very crispy with the innards seasoned well and yummy  I could ve had just these empanadas and been perfectly satisfied  although it would ve probably taken    of them    I would recommend Gaucho Parilla to anyone visiting or even residing in Pittsburgh if it didn t take forever to get into the restaurant and order  I would not recommend if you re coming with a super large party  although they can very well accommodate for one ,4,2018-01-24
Fantastic  fresh  awesome  Try to sample all the meats  Mushrooms  potatoes  and corn are also on point  Try all the sauces too ,5,2014-11-29
Had the rosemary shrimp  grilled veggies  and the rosemary beef brisket  It was good but there are better places to stop in Pittsburgh  Sit outside and make sure you grab some spices if you want them  It s BYOB too ,3,2014-09-05
it is nearly impossible to find a restaurant that accommodates my paleo diet   and isn t just a boring salad  Gaucho absolutely blew my mind in flavor   service  and our meal was prepared quickly  a relief because the smells in there made me salivate immediately   My friend   I shared sides and an appetizer   do NOT skip the Provoleta  guys  seriously  We had the honey goat cheese carrots   garlic potatoes which perfectly complimented our steaks  each was prepared to absolute perfection  I m still dreaming about this meal  and almost went back the very next day for lunch ,5,2019-04-24
Amazing  It s worth the long line ,5,2015-12-04
When I came here  I got the corn on the cob and the Pescado special  which was an Arctic char  The Arctic char was incredible  one of the best pieces of fish I ve had  Corn was excellent too  It s BYOB  so if you re looking for a drink  be sure to remember to bring your own  I can t say enough good things about the food quality and service  I ll definitely be back ,5,2019-07-10
Great atmosphere and excellent food  We had the flank steak plate and we all devoured them  Thumbs up Gauchos ,5,2019-07-23
This place was pretty decent  The staff was super friendly and helpful and the ambiance was super cool but I had to knock off a couple of stars because flavor was lacking a little bit  I ordered some ribeye   medium rare  and it was pretty good  but it was sooooo charred and needed some salt  The chimichurri kind of saved it  but not enough  The potatoes were good  but again  missing salt  I think I might try there again and try a different cut of meat and a different side  The bread  sourdough   was so great  and the salad was good  nothing great about it  but nothing bad  ,3,2019-10-26
One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh  worth the wait  Love their sauces ,5,2016-11-13
Why aren t there more shops like this around   On the West end of the Strip is this little Argentinian restaurant called Gaucho  It s easy to walk by without taking notice     but the wood paneling and the amazing grill aromas will draw you in  They even have fresh rosemary growing in the store to use for their marinades and sauces  There is limited bar style seating along the walls   The staff is super friendly and inviting  The shop is about two months old  so they re still soliciting feedback on menu items and concepts from customers  I believe they are soon opening up their outdoor seating section as well   The menu is actually quite big for such a small shop  with everything from sandwiches  to salads  to full entrees available  We decided to go for a Saturday lunch  and it wasn t too crowded inside at all  We asked one of the staff what the most popular items were  and he said the carne sandwiches were the hot item  I went with a ribeye carne sandwich  you can choose from different cuts of steak    while the rest of the family tried the chorizo and pollo sandwiches    The carne and chorizo sandwiches are loaded with roasted peppers and onions  while the chicken sandwich is loaded with portobello mushroom and onion  They all sit on ciabatta bread  The meats were all extremely flavorful and generously portioned  The ribeye had an amazing rosemary marinade on it that just elevated the taste experience to another level  While there are four different sauces you can experiment with in the center island  I highly recommend trying them all   the carne sandwich really didn t need any extra flavor at all  So good  The rest of the family thoroughly enjoyed their choices as well  I really wanted to try some of the grilled vegetable items  OK fine  I wanted to try everything on the menu   but I was full already   This is such a great introduction of Argentinian grill food to the Pittsburgh area  and I can only see Gaucho gaining infamy as THE place for an incredibly authentic bite of Argentina ,5,2013-04-29
I go against the grain  I thought it was an amazingly salty place  I had my month worth of dietary sodium all in one sitting  Still don t know why if it is a steak place they don t ask how a customer prefers his meat like rare medium or well done    ,2,2014-09-09
Gaucho is always fantastic   This trip three of us shared the paella   Paella is served in a    inch pan  which was more than enough for all of us for a total of       We did not get any bread or sides   With apps or sides the paella dish would feed     people   The dish itself was very good with a nice amount of mussels  shrimp and clams along with chicken and sausage ,5,2016-02-20
Ate here last week Tuesday and lunch time on Wednesday  This place is a must if you love open fire flame cooking  The Cordero lamb chops were the best lamb chops that I have eaten in years  The Papas Dulce had amazing seasonings on it  The lamb was cooked to perfection during dinner time  The Lunch time chef didn t get my lamb medium rare like I requested  but it was still tasty  I ll be heading back there in the coming months for work and will definitely make it a destination ,5,2017-03-13
I ve been to Guaucho twice now for lunch  once with my fiance and most recently this past Tuesday with my father   The inside of this restaurant is quite small and probably seats only around    people with seating for    or more outside next to the restaurant   There s not too many decorations inside either although there is a chalkboard menu which you can order from and then on a center table there is an area where you can grab your utensils or serve yourself any of their four sauces   Both of the times that I was at Gaucho I ended up ordering the Carn  for my entree   The Carne is their steak sandwich which allows you to choose between one of the   cuts of steak that they serve and that comes with roasted red peppers and onions on a nice ciabbata roll   The first time that I was there I ordered the skirt steak but I heard the owner mentioning this last time that it is no longer on the menu and has been replaced by the hangar steak   So this last time I ended up choosing the rib eye as the cut of steak that I wanted   As with all of the meat that I have tried here it had the wonderful wood smoked flavor to it   My only complaint about it is that it was a bit tougher than I expected and so made for some hard chewing   We also ended up ordering the large portion of vegetables which I have had both times that I have visited now   They consist of onions  roasted red peppers  zucchini and asparagus  Surprisingly  this ended up producing my favorite part of the meal as the roasted red peppers have a great natural sweetness to them and when combined with the sweet balsamic drizzle on top  makes for the perfect counterpoint to the wood smoked flavor   Honestly  I could probably eat those red peppers all day   The rest of the vegetables were good as well and most had a hint of the smokiness but none came close to what the peppers absorbed   My dad was also a big fan of the bread  both the ciabatta that my sandwich came on and also the crostini like object that came with his meal   He really enjoyed dipping them into a few of the four sauces that they have laid out for you to taste and even passed up eating more steak to dip some more bread   The bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here again in the future   While it has a downside of only being open      Tuesday Saturday and also is small  it is well worth the trip to the Strip District   Their food is pretty amazing and I especially love the smoky flavor on everything that comes out of Gaucho ,5,2014-09-23
Their food is always perfectly cooked and full of flavor  The staff is ahead of the game  I would say I wish the place was bigger but I don t think it would matter  Their food is so good it is worth waiting for and I think there would always be a line ,5,2019-03-15
This place is perfect and completely worth the long wait you ll have in line  They also have surprisingly good vegetarian options  I have thoroughly enjoyed every meal I ve had here  The staff is friendly and welcoming and the decor is adorable  Pro tip  Go at       and the line is much shorter ,5,2016-03-09
Tried the steak burger because the thrillist article   It was pretty good but not mind blowing   I got cheese and grilled onions as toppings   I probably should have gotten another topping  The bread it s on is fantastic  I also got one empanada and it was pretty good  Nothing spectacular   I will be back sometime to try something else   I guess a plate of meat or something ,4,2015-11-30
We had an amazing meal here about an hour ago before the game  We looked up healthy places to eat in Pittsburgh and this place came up  They have a wide variety of options for meat lovers and vegetarians alike  All their food is wood fire grilled  The service here is so kind  I m definately going to recommend this place to everyone  We will be returning very soon,5,2015-08-28
Worth the wait  Being in line wasnt too bad  Maybe ten mins  They have a good system so by the time u get to the end u sit right down n the food comes right out  And boy was it delicious  ,5,2019-11-26
We visited Gaucho in the strip district after seeing many reviews and pictures on social media  We  were prepared for a long wait so we arrived early  and not hungry yet  on a Saturday night  We arrived around     p and the wait was about an hour  Not bad and totally worth it   would have been a lot worse if we arrived famished    Staff was nice and handed out waters to the line as we waited  My hubby and I  ordered the asado platter      cuts of meats  and the grilled vegetable plate  We just split both and it was the perfect amount and we loved that we got to try a bit of all cuts of steak they offer   Amazing amazing amazing  And the four chimichurri sauces were the icing on the top of the cake  We will absolutely be back  We would love to see another gaucho location pop up in Pittsburgh so the wait times could decrease   But     none the less  ,5,2019-06-30
I was PLANNING on taking a picture of my food  but the second I got it  I started cutting  I don t want to exaggerate because I love steak  but this was probably the best steak I ve ever had in my life  I had the sirloin and the potatoes and it was unbelievable  The steak was cooked perfectly  it was juicy  it was tender  it was flavorful  The potatoes were unbelievable as well  Don t listen to anyone who says anything other than   stars  The wait in the cold was absolutely worth it ,5,2018-12-29
Excellent quality meats and food  Very friendly staff as well  Not big so it s either a take out place or you can eat on the patio outside if it s nice out ,5,2014-10-01
Sometimes going to a multi hundred five star reviewed restaurant is taking a chance  because how could anything really live up to that sort of expectation   Well  Gaucho does   My first encounter with them was at a Yelp Elite event at which they were one of the caterers   I was really taken with not only the absolute deliciousness of the food  but also the very down to earth attitude of its owner   It took nearly four months since that first encounter  to finally drop in on their tiny  but soon to be expanded  space in the Strip  but it was abso freaking loutely worth the wait   My  God   I got a small plate of the flank steak  plus I split the cheese toast with my friend   Another customer who was waiting for a takeout order also made sure I didn t forget to grab one of each kind of sauce  all of which seemed to be variations on chimichurri sauce   I probably would have found my way to them regardless  but I was glad of the advice   They made what was an incredible lunch even better   I couldn t stop dipping both  my bread and meat into them   I just   I can t even describe how delicious this food was   The best part was that I still felt really good afterwards   More than satiated  but not sluggish like one might be after dishes that rely on heavy fat  salt  and or sugar to get the yum factor   This was just expertly prepared meat  a delicious salad  and perfectly chewy grilled bread   Next time  for there WILL be a next time   I m getting at one of those sandwiches  though ,5,2015-03-31
I ve gotta keep this succinct solely so whoever is reading this see s this review  reads it  and go s right to Gaucho to hop in line  Simply put  the food is incredible and ardently cooked and created    The first two or three times I went  I wasn t a vegetarian and I had my pickings with the chicken and steak  Both indubitably incredible  The potatoes on the side are a must    I ve been back  ironically  as a vegetarian and still  the food is just as good  I ve gotten a few salads  without the meat  And I still have no complaints  The vegetables and produce are fresh  and everything is tossed beautifully with tasteful dressing  I feel like I m eating a   star meal without the   star price  It s pragmatically priced and seriously good ,5,2018-08-03
I cannot wait to go back         This place gives me an excuse to eat well during the week  and then splurge here   We ordered skirt steak on field greens with carmelized onions  and the shrimp with rosemary and lemon   We loved everything we got   We forgot this place was BYOB and the manager even offered me a glass of his own wine   Super nice people  AMAZING steak   The next time I go back I am doing the sampler   I will say  if you want a standard restaurant with a server  and a sit down menu  and lots of indoor tables   It is not for you   If you don t mind standing  or sitting at a bar or outside tables  then you are golden  It has a New York  Boston  or Paris vibe to me  Which is exactly what Pittsburgh needed   I am a huge fan  and I can t wait to spread the word ,5,2013-06-17
Gaucho is nice   the food is good and varied and I love how you can customize all Your orders   Make sure to get the potatoes with garlic and rosemary  I don t appreciate all the waiters there   But the majority were nice   Worth trying and going back  ,5,2019-06-27
Damn  Get anything  Get everything  It s all insanely good  Don t sleep on the bread pudding ,5,2019-07-12
I m never disappointed leaving Gaucho  I have been visiting the restaurant for a couple of years now   ever since they just had the little spot with the nice patio  Everything is delicious  And they have treats for dogs  too   ,5,2016-05-03
Best meat in the city  I usually always pick the skirt steak  The only downside is that it s quite small so there is usually a wait and not much seating  These guys should definitely expand their restaurant size    they have plenty of customers to fill it up ,5,2014-06-25
Amazing quality and taste   Most restaurants lack consistency of  execution  Not here   Every item comes out consistently well cooked and seasoned   If there is a negative it s the lack of space to accommodate the ever growing crowds that galdy wait in line for a taste of heaven ,5,2015-03-02
I m obsessed with this place  always a wait because the food is so good  BYOB and reasonable places,5,2019-03-09
Steak and empanadas were perfect  BYOB  come prepare to enjoy your liquid libations  Prepare for the wait during dinner but totally worth it  Will not disappoint  Staff were nice and courteous ,5,2019-03-29
I really like the idea of this place and was excited to try it  We ordered the ribeye steak and the camarones  shrimp   The steak was tasty and was cooked properly  and the side salad with grilled vegetables was nice  The shrimp were good but a little on the small side  I was expecting bigger shrimp for the price  Overall  it was good and I like the idea a lot  but the price is high for what you get ,4,2015-01-01
Wow  This place is amazing  Hands down the best food I have eaten since visiting Pittsburgh  Take the recommendations from staff they will not steer you wrong  I went in at closing and they still were well stocked with the menu items and everything was so fresh  I had the salmon and it was amazing  The yams were like dessert and they have free refills on soda  The place is BYOB so grab your drinks and put one back for me too ,5,2016-03-30
Great ambience  Friendly  knowledgable staff  Fast service  I tried the El Gaucho  which was delicious but I must confess kind of small for     that I paid for it  ordered the large   Will definitely go back  I can t wait to try the steak ,4,2014-07-11
Great environment and food tastes great  It s like a party here  Terrible drink selection and not much on vegetables  but everything else was amazing ,4,2016-03-03
Meats are good  sauces are fun  but the filet is totally not worth it    usually a lot tougher than the flank and cooked not as well  Compared to the rest of Pittsburgh  this place is probably the best meat you can get for the price    although it s not cheap  still a good deal for getting pure meat chunks   Overall  a great meal and you ll get what you want  I think the salads and side dishes don t stand out as much as the meat  This is a great stop to have if you re ever in the Pittsburgh area    Wait times can get unbearably long  and the waiting area is poorly designed    there s a risk of fire hazard when there are too many people bunched up so they force you to be outside  Lunch times are usually better I ve heard  so maybe try to visit then ,4,2019-12-03
We found this great gem via Yelp and it had rave reviews   We went for dinner while visiting the Pittsburgh area for a college visit   As everyone mentions   be sure to arrive early as lines do form and service is first come   first serve   The porters do a fabulous job of seating you and checking up on you throughout your meal  Gaucho is BYOB so if that s your thing   bring a bottle or two   The food was spectacular  We tried the beef empanadas   rosemary beef sandwich   artic char sandwich   veggie platter and carrots roasted in honey with brie cheese   No complaints   but the noise level from time to time was a bit much   We d definitely return and highly recommend Gaucho to anyone visiting the area ,5,2019-07-12
This was my first trip here and I was a bit overwhelmed at first  as I have never had Argentinian food  however  the employees were very helpful and I am glad I tried this place  as the food was excellent   I ordered the chor y pan  which was a chorizo sandwich with a beef empanada and my wife and I ordered the Picada to split   Everything was excellent and cooked to perfection   The food was a bit pricey  but worth it   I will be returning ,5,2019-09-26
I will always  ALWAYS rave about Gaucho  I m a pretty easy going lady  so my friends and I usually opt for playing  Heads Up  in line instead of just complaining about the wait  which makes time go much faster  If you re upset that the menu is on a giant chalkboard inside  it s also online  And you know you re always looking at your phone anyway    Last time we bought a bottle of wine  and between the   of us we did not mind splitting the     corking fee  We only had one bottle  so I personally cannot speak to any additional time incurred when ordering multiple beverages  We ordered the Asado Platter  rare  and it was perfect  We paired it with some chimi sauce and extra tostado  along with a few empanadas  As for atmosphere  the staff has always been friendly to me and the music is always chill neutral  Love ya  Gaucho ,5,2019-11-17
I ve been here twice now when visiting Pittsburgh  And I must say  it has solidified itself as a go to for steak  Both times I had the Ribeye  medium rare  And both times it was perfectly cooked and seasoned  I like the variety of dipping sauces  I d recommend that you go with the beef cut that you like  I personally like Ribeye   Others in my party ordered salads and added steak to it  they looked really good  I will need to go that route next time   We also ordered the empanadas  I liked the veggie and the beef ,5,2019-02-25
I have been hating to try this place for a very long time  had tried it about   months ago and had stood in line for about    minutes and line was not moving and we had a concert to go to so we had to leave so this time we made sure to get there well ahead of are plans for the evening  We only had to stand in line about    minutes and was in   Just so you know you will have to wait anywhere from   minutes to an hour to get in  You order you food at the counter and pay and then they will seat you  They have four different sauces for your meats all of them are delicious   We started out with Oui Oui Chicken    legs and   thighs  My husband said it is the BEST chicken he has ever had  We also had   pieces of Empanadas one beef and one chicken  they were so delicious I could have just made a meal out of them  Then we both had Carne Sandwiches you pick your choice of steak and it also has peppers and caramelized onions  it was very good but it is very hard to eat as a sandwich because the bread it so big  I had to eat it as a open face sandwich  the bread is very good and fresh but just to big for a sandwich  They are closed on Sunday and Mondays  the restaurant is very clean and staff works very hard and very friendly ,5,2019-03-03
Absolute best steak sandwich I ve had in years   People of Pittsburgh should flock to this place and be lining up out the door   The sandwiches  salads  and apps are amazing   The sauces to accompany the empanadas and sandwiches are also delicious    Wow is all I can say ,5,2013-09-28
Food is pretty good  Went with friends and am vegetarian  Had the veggie sandwich and potato empanadas  Good bread  veggies were grilled and a bit soggy  so I removed some  Empanadas were more bland than preferred  but they offer delicious sauces to add a kick to them  Friendly staff and services  I would try something else going back ,4,2016-04-09
Everything is amazing  I love all of the sauces  Just don t come here if your in a hurry at a prime eating time ,5,2017-10-24
Very poor customer service  I wish i could give them zero  Our friends recommended this place  We decided to have dinner here  We called before we go there  Nobody even bothered to pick up the phone  We were there    minutes before their close time  They said they are closing the kitchen and they wouldn t serve us  We insisted since we drove from Virginia but they didn t even respond and shut door on us  I guess she didn t care ,1,2016-12-31
This place was AMAZING  The food was spectacular  the ambience cute  people extremely nice and service fast  All around easily a   star experience  This will be the thing I remember from my trip to Pittsburg  It was easily the highlight and if I make it back to this city  I would eat here again in a heartbeat ,5,2018-12-11
I had really high expectations for this place  as I had heard about it from so many people  I knew we would have to wait in line  which we did  but the line went pretty fast and we were sitting down eating within a half an hour  The quality of the meat was very good  but it was not quite as delicious or flavorful as I expected  Regardless  the food was very good  It is a little on the expensive side  but worth it for the quality  Also dessert was fabulous ,4,2018-10-25
The steak sandwich  with filet mignon  was probably the most delicious sandwich I ve ever had   The meat was so tender that it was almost of the same consistency as the soft bread   This is one of the few restaurants in the Strip District that I would go to regularly ,5,2013-08-26
I will definitely go back  It was delicious  the service was good  Dessert took a little long  but we got it ,4,2018-11-08
We have been to this place twice now  After this time we will never return  To start with the food is not very good at all  Second  the place is way over priced  Third  the service is terrible and five minutes after we were finished eating we were asked to leave so they could use the table   The place is super small but they are supposed to have a private banquet facility downstairs  Why not open that up to seating so your not kicking you customers out       for dinner and we were promptly kicked out  Don t go  this place isn t worth it at all   ,1,2017-02-09
Delicious  Can t go wrong with anything on the menu  I ordered the flank steak sandwich with a side of potatoes  I would order it again   The staff is super friendly  too with good tunes playing in the background  It s BYOB with a selection of soft drinks    Be careful of when you go  For those of you that are not familiar  you wait in line to order your food and then you are seated  We went there around      on a Tuesday and only had to wait about    minutes in line  I m sure it is much long on weekends   But it is worth the wait      Definitely check this place out if you are looking for a good meaty meal ,5,2016-07-12
Food was good My only issue with the place is the wait  We waited    mins at  pm To me it s just not worth it  Standing in the hot sun just waiting to get in  I thought would have produced mouth watering food  And by the time we got out the wait was   hours ,3,2019-08-13
Definitely one of the best steakhouse I ever ate  and I ate a lot   The skirt steak and the ribeye are my favorite  Really really recommend on this place  Why I gave only   stars instead of    It s because I don t like to wait outside and wait to be sitting  Especially when it s so cold outside  most of the time it s really cold in Pittsburgh   They have to do something about that ,4,2018-11-28
The only bad thing to say about this place is the long line but that s testament to the great food  great customer service  and good times you ll have  once you get your food  ,5,2016-09-21
The only bad thing about Gaucho is how long the line can get  I ve only been there a couple times because I never have time to wait in the huge line  but it would probably be worth it  The food is absolutely amazing  There aren t a ton of tables  but they seat you after you order so at least you ll know you have a place  Then they bring the food out to you too   The sandwiches are all awesome  I love the Carne where you get to pick which cut of steak you want on your sandwich and it s paired with chimichurri  peppers and onions on delicious bread  It really holds up to the sandwich  I got NY Strip this most recent trip  but want to try them all  It was just a perfect sandwich  Depending on the sandwich you get  you ll be able to try some of their sauces  I loved the chimichurri that came with this  but also want to try one of the sandwiches where I can add my own sauce   The roasted potato side is delicious  Also really good is the mushroom side  I d trust any of their food  The alfajores are delicious and a great finish to your meal   if you even have room after all of the tasty food  We were told they were good with coffee  but chose not to get any this trip  I ll have to try it next time since I definitely plan to go back ,5,2017-02-17
My first time here after hearing a lot of hype and it didn t disappoint  The line snaked outside on a Saturday afternoon but it moved quickly and as soon as we entered the building we could smell the delicious aroma  The menu was extensive and we had difficulty deciding what to get   We settled on the seared shrimp   camarones   to share and I got the Carne sandwich  one of their staples  All was delicious and service was quick   Would definitely come back ,5,2019-03-31
This was my first time trying Argentinian food  and let me tell you  wow   I chose the deconstructed chicken sandwich and my boyfriend had the steak burger  We both really enjoyed our meats  served hot and cooked perfectly   as well as a side of baked cauliflower  which was delicious  The best part about Gaucho is definitely the sauces  though  They have four different sauces you can choose from  and we had a hard time picking which was our favorite  so we used them all  of course   Additionally  the restaurant is BYOB  with no corkage fee which is a plus  The only downside was the wait to get in  since they dont take reservations  There was a steady line out the door the entire time we were there  from about   PM     PM   The food is definitely worth the wait  and I cant wait to get back there to try out some of the other stuff on the menu ,4,2018-06-28
I didn t believe this place could live up to my expectations but my food was simply incredible  After much internal debate I got the skirt steak sandwich  Perfect grilled bread and tender meat at just the right temp    Service was also fantastic  The guy taking orders came out from behind the counter and gave us a thorough run down of the menu  His enthusiasm was refreshing and a great example of what service should be like   Can t wait to try this place again ,5,2014-05-06
Caramelized Onion Soup with Portobello and a side toasted cheese bread was fantastic  And the Chorizo sandwich with their  Chimmi Churri   homemade dressing with TONS of fresh herbs    was ridiculously flavorful     Love this small little GEM  I just happened to stumble across this place in the Strip  The friendly staff was also great and helpful in explaining the menu if I had any questions   I will definitely be trying it again ,5,2014-03-26
Amazing food  We found this place on yelp and decided to try it given all the rave reviews  It was a fantastic meal  We tried steak  chicken  shrimp  cauliflower  and salad and everything was delicious  Don t worry about what to order  Order small plates so you can try lots of variety ,5,2018-07-25
It s legitimately one of the best places to grab food in Pittsburgh   A destination for foodies as it is a serious introduction into the up and coming culinary movement going on in the steel city ,5,2017-12-27
Delicious food but not worth the wait  If the line is out the door and wraps around to the side restaurant window  you re looking at about     hours   of standing in a line   to order your food at a counter   at a place that doesn t serve beer and wine  If I m going out for a meal  I d rather go to a place where I can sit or put my name in for a table and then come back ,3,2017-09-13
Such good food here  And fast service    Came here for a lunch on a Friday at noon and there was a short line  which took a bit to get through  However  after ordering  the food came out super fast and it was so tasty  I ordered the Picada and a set of   empanadas    of each type   The chicken chorizo empanada was by far my favorite  Great textures and flavors  For the picada  the meat was cured very nicely and went well with all of the other components  The toast was a little too hard and crunchy for my taste  but it was still really good   Highly recommended ,5,2019-11-16
I asked a few locals  cashiers  uber drivers  etc  what their recommendations were since I was visiting Pitt for a weekend conference and every single person recommended Gaucho Parrilla  It was such an easy decision to come here  and I would do it again     Came in on a weekday and there was still a line out the door  although waiting area line is kind of a small space   and the line went by fairly quickly    I m sure all their selections are good  but I had to go for the flank steak plate because it was one of the cheapest  but it was still sooooo good  It was well seasoned  not too salty  juicy and so flavorful   Also ordered all   empenadas to share with the group  Great textured breading and flavorful meat veggies  Great for sharing  and try a little bit of everything    Great ambiance  service  and food  Highly recommended ,5,2019-05-21
Whenever you see a place on Yelp that has over      reviews and     stars  you have to stop in and that s just what I did and I am SO glad     Now I just have to convince them to open a Gaucho Parrilla in Columbus  Ohio    For starters  if you re going to GPA  you need to get there as early as you can because the lines get really long  really quickly   My group of four arrived at around  pm on a Saturday night and the line was already out the door     Once you re in the line  you can check out their chalkboard menu   Be aware that they will erase items as soon as they re sold out of them so have a backup in mind just in case they run out before you can order   After you place your order  the restaurant staff will hook you up with a table in their dining area   The decor is really cool with an old western feel   They have plenty of non alcoholic drinks for your convenience but this is actually a BYOB establishment   They will provide you with stemware and you can bring in whatever you want   This is a great way to ensure you ll be able to drink what you want and it comes at a lesser cost   They don t even charge a corkage fee     Now for the best part  the food   My meal at GPA ranks in the top ten meals I have ever consumed  in my life   I am not exaggerating   I ordered the sirloin with a side of grits   My steak was cooked to perfection and had the most delicious seasoning   It came with a side salad that was fresh and tasty   I also enjoyed a piece of chargrilled toast and it was amazing   Finally  the grits were the best I ve ever had in my life and that is no tall tale   This place gets ALL of the stars     We all loved it and next time I go to Pittsburgh  I will likely eat all of my meals there because that city definitely has nothing that could top Gaucho Parillo Argentina   Keep up the work  GPA   See you next time I m in town    Unless  of course  you decide to take up my offer to come to Ohio    ,5,2018-01-04
Oh man  This place  guys  Well worth the weekend     minute lunchtime wait  but Gaucho can also be the source of overwhelming joy when you find  as I did  an empty sitting room awaiting you and a buddy on an overcast pre summer weekday in the  Burgh  The rosemary braised beef sandwich is absolutely out of this world  If you are a horseradish fan as I am  read  this classy lady will take some horsey sauce with her fried zucchini at your average nondescript yinzer suburban strip mall pizza joint  yes please and thank you ma am   you will love this sandwich  but the star of the show is most definitely the melt in your mouth beef  The sandwich is big enough for leftovers  but you might find yourself going in for that second half whether you re still hungry or not  Would also highly recommend checking out the sides  which I believe are seasonal   especially if you re with a friend  on another visit in sunny summer  we split a corn salad of sorts which was as fresh as can be  Absolutely love me some Gaucho ,5,2016-09-17
Spent   days in Pitt had to eat here twice  Food service atmosphere are awesome  Everything on this menu is simple fresh and amazing  Try the piscada starter and any meat dish  You will not be disappointed or mind that you waited on a huge line to get in  BTW it s BYOB so bring a bottle the staff is more than happy to uncork you and supply glasses  I have three things more to say  GO HERE  go here  GO HERE  Returned back on          it s as good as ever       ,5,2016-04-17
Best steak salad in the city  I routinely crave the charred but definitely not over cooked goodness that is a gaucho steak  The blue cheese and baby potatoes on top seal the deal ,5,2018-12-15
One of the best spots in PGH  but expect a wait  Fast casual and line is usually out the door  But it s so so worth it  Shrimp and flank steak are incredible  Even the cauliflower is fantastic ,5,2019-01-10
On my trip to Pittsburg I heard through the grapevine that this place was somewhere I had to go  Well this place was fantastic and it is a must go to place if you are in Pittsburg and you love meat  Everything tasted extremely good  The steak came out to perfection and the sides were very good as well  They also server about     different meat sauces  These are probably the best part and take the meat to a whole different level  This place is kinda expensive so be prepared to spend a little  But it is totally worth it for sure    The building is small  but the food is good so I could understand why there was a long line when I arrived  They have a very nice setup that relied on mostly natural lighting  I like that they had l  containers of spice next to the line so you could taste them  We had to wait about    minutes to get to the desk then about another       for the food  But it was worth the wait  I would suggest maybe googling this place to see when the least busiest times are and go then ,5,2018-02-20
We went to Gaucho at around     pm on a    degree Saturday and  you guessed it  the line was out the door  We waited an hour from the time we got in line to the time we placed our order and it was worth every minute  Our party of   shared the pescado  the grilled veggies  an empanada assortment  the smaller meat platter  rice  the short rib special  and the rosemary braised beef sandwich  It was ALL delicious and we ate every bit with the exception of about a half cup of rice  Fun  relaxed atmosphere and the food is served quickly  BYOB makes it even better   we brought a bottle of red to share and then capped the meal off with some cold Rumchata  One of the employees  Micah  was chatting with us  getting refills and brought us rocks glasses with ice for the Rumchata  He was extremely friendly and helpful  My only wish is that you could sit down and order like a  regular  restaurant  And that they held off a bit on the cowbell  it was extremely loud and happened too often for my parties  taste  It won t stop me from going to Gaucho again though  I look forward to the next rosemary braised beef bite ,5,2016-04-18
Superb  Long lines at times though  Try going before or after the lunch rush during the weekdays  I talk about this place often  Do yourself a favor and go ,5,2018-10-05
I had lunch at Gaucho s today  Let s get the cold prickly s out of the way first    This place is small  There are   uncomfortable stools with very limited counter space and it gets really crowded in that cramp space   Not a very good place to go if you re looking for a nice sitdown meal    It s also pretty expensive as far as a lunch sandwich goes   My sandwich set me back           No sides  no drink    Lastly  it s a bit of a hike if you work in town  To get here from town you would be walking past a number of other pretty good and much more comfortable eateries just to get here  And if you planned on take out  your sandwich would be cold by the time you walked back to you desk    Now on to the  warm fuzzies    The sandwich I had was unbelievably good  Quite possibly the very best sandwich in the Burg  I got the Carne with ribeye steak  It was a generous serving of real ribeye steak right off of the grill  not some shaved imposter    I m a bit shy when it comes to ordering steak when I go out   I like mine well done and most places can t seem to comprehend what  well done  means   This ribeye was grilled to perfection  no pink on the inside  no char on the outside  It was brown all the way through while still retaining its juiciness   Topping the sandwich off was chimmi  caramelized onion   pepper all between a lightly toasted bun  Perfection    Well worth every penny I spent on it    I was lucky enough to snag one of the six stools and enjoy my sandwich as soon as it came off the grill and while it was still warm   If it weren t for the cramped and limited seating I d give this place a five star rating  Unfortunately the accommodations knocked it down a notch       NOTE                  As Lisa G  mentioned in her review of Goucho s  they are planning on expanding their restaurant to include better seating accommodations   I m looking forward to the new and improved Goucho s    Thanks for addressing that Lisa ,4,2015-03-11
I ate at Gaucho s for the first time on a date this weekend   We didn t get there until after six  so we waited a while in the line outside  but the food was definitely worth the wait  even considering the cold   The restaurant is BYOB so come prepared with your favorite cerveza   We ordered the Parrilloda Mixta  the Provoletta and the Gaucho Papas   I promise you everything was exceedingly delicious   We ordered the steak medium rare and it was cooked perfectly   The chorizo was perhaps the best I ve ever had and the chicken was well seasoned and tasty   Once we ordered  we did not wait long for our food   You order at the counter  collect your plates and sauces and then find a seat   I think we probably waited       minutes for the food   I must say it s a shame they re closed on Sunday  because as I write this review  I want more Gauchos   Also  they have some really original Pittsburgh art on the walls that is for sale  just an extra touch I thought added to the overall appeal   Great pick John ,5,2016-01-25
My new favorite place in Pittsburgh  Food was amazing  staff very friendly and outgoing      well wirth the wait ,5,2016-03-26
D e l i c i o u s place  You must try the empanadas  both pork and beef  with the red pepper sauce  The steak was really good  we ate parrilla mixta it was really good  a little bit small to share  but good  this plate cost      You must try everything  cause everything looks good   ,5,2016-12-30
Gaucho is always packed  The food is delicious given everything is firewood charred  You wait in line to order before sitting  so it s a great place to go with friends  I ordered papas al horno  oven roasted red potatoes with whole garlic cloves and fresh rosemary  as a side  and it does not disappoint  It s extremely flavorful and goes well with the free side dips as well  I also ordered camarones to share  cast iron seared shrimp with rosemary  garlic and lemon   which the searing of the garlic and lemon really brings out the flavor  The bondiola sandwich  roasted pulled pork  spicy mustard   caramelized onions  was also good  but the flavor is lighter in comparison to the  I other dishes  My personal favorite was the cordero  wood fired New Zealand lamb chops done with grilled lemon  toast and fresh tossed salad   The lamb chops were well charred and the added berries as topping to the lamb was perfect ,5,2017-06-01
There are very few restaurants that I will wait an hour in line for  Considering Gaucho has some of the best reviews in Pittsburgh  I decided to give it a try and accept the possibility of a wait  We arrived around     pm on a Saturday evening and waited about an hour to get inside  Luckily  it was not very cold outside so we didn t mind    The menu is quite vast  We decided to each order an entree  I went with the rosemary braised beef sandwich  and sides of the provoletta and butternut squash  Everything came out quickly  The sides were fantastic   I particularly enjoyed the butternut squash  The braised beef sandwich was massive   I could only eat half of it  The beef was tender and reminded me of home cooked Sunday meals  Overall  it was great food  very neat atmosphere  and I can understand why people will flock to this restaurant and willingly stand in line for the food    Beware  there is a     corkage fee  This fee seems pretty hefty to me and I have rarely heard of restaurants choosing to opt for only BYOW  Bring Your Own Wine   I would be interested to know why they went that route ,4,2019-11-03
Best steak sandwich I ve ever had  You can see them grilling the steak as you order  so fresh and delicious    I got the rib eye steak sandwich and it had     large pieces of steak on a large cibatta  don t quote me on the cibatta bun  it could have been something else   with caramelized onions and roasted red peppers  Mmm  salivating just thinking about it    The server came outside to their patio seating and asked me how the sandwich was  Nice touch    Not much seating inside  but nice patio seating    Very pleased and a must try when you are in the Pittsburgh area ,5,2014-06-09
This place is wonderful  I was fortunate enough to get in during the lunch rush and ordered,5,2015-08-16
Awesome Food but there is a line  it does move quickly       Okay   I may get grilled  no pun intended  with this review    Imagine Brazilian Steak House meats served on a plate as an entree with a variety of sauces      This is what you get at Gaucho     We had several plates   My meal was     and I had   ounces of each chicken  beef  and chorizo     The food was done very well and tasted great    The place was busy the food was good but the price was a little steep comparative to other like places I have visited considering what I purchased     It is   stars and I recommend but drink in the experience   The line is fast    The service is fast  in my opinion     The drinks are good   We were in and out in about    minutes off to our next stop ,4,2017-08-21
Bon appetit   Being as this was my first time dining here after hearing all the hype  I have to admit that everything that has been said is true  The food was nothing short of phenomenal  I couldn t have asked for a better experience  I especially appreciate the ease of ordering  being seating and the numerous options of entrees and chimichurri    I arrived with a party of   and was delighted that we had a table ready for us  What eas even better was our food was coming to us hot and steamy no more than   minuted later  I found it impressive to prepare appetizers and entrees for   in such an efficient time   I ordered the small plate of shrimp    total  the roasted potatoes and a veggie empanada  All were amazing  I m ready to come back here next week  and how could I forget BYOB completely complimentary ,5,2018-03-10
I found heaven    Its the steak burger with portobello and caramelized onions  I ve never been to a restaurants were everything I try is amazing  Until you go  your life isn t complete ,5,2015-06-05
Love the food at Gaucho  but was super disappointed when we showed up at      PM on a Saturday night and were told by the last couple in line that they weren t taking any additional patrons  they have him a red stick to hold to show they were the last table of the night   Given they list they re closing time at        I would have expected getting in a short line at      would have been fine ,2,2019-02-17
I rarely review but Gaucho is extraordinary   The employees are super nice  the food is unreal  i want to swim in that green sauce whatever it is    Haven t done the bodga yet but can t wait to try it   Love it ,5,2019-02-22
I took my boss there who has been to a lot of restaurants  around the world and he said  that s the best restaurant I have ever been to ,5,2017-09-23
This is one of my favorite Pittsburgh restaurants  I only go at   PM on a weekday to beat the crowds  I love that the byob has no charge and that the food is consistent  The Ajo sauce is my favorite so make sure to try it,5,2018-10-24
Gaucho does have some great food  but my last visit was quite disappointing  My burger was so salty it was difficult to eat  my dining companion noticed the same  I always worry that cooks add more sat when something is wrong with the food       I don t expect restaurant food to be necessarily healthy  but when the salt burns your lips   something is really wrong  Whats wrong with regular seasoning  not going overboard ,3,2018-12-13
The food here is really good   You might have to wait in line to get in  but Gaucho takes the sting out of the wait if you ve brought your own beverages by opening your bottle and giving you a cup   The food  though  is the draw   Customer service is good  and the atmosphere is fun   Always fun ,4,2017-01-26
It is hard to open your mouth wide enough to fit the sandwich   GREAT authentic food     My son said it was his FAVORITE place that I took him to eat on our international  gastronomic tour of the Burgh  ,5,2015-07-03
The beef was top notch   The sauces are great   The non beef was just okay ,4,2016-09-01
Hands down one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh  tied with DiAnnoias   If you plan on dining here  get ready to wait  They don t take reservations and there is usually a long line  My husband and I made the mistake of going on a Saturday night and waited about an hour  This restaurant recently changed there alcohol policy  it used to be BYOB  but is now bring your own wine  with a     corking fee  and they now serve beer and liquor  The food is      worth it  Come hungry so you can experience as much of this amazing menu as possible  The only thing I would ve possibly skipped was the roasted potatoes  they weren t bad but we re pretty basic  Definitely do not forget to get some of the amazing serve yourself chimichurri sauce to pair with your meats ,5,2019-11-27
Wow I ve not had a better sandwich in a long time    The bread is soft and delicious  It s not one of those sandwiches you need to fight with to get the job done     it just cooperates  Your teeth slice right through but it s not mushy     it s just perfect    The meat is flavored marinated all the way through  And the wood fired grill makes anything they throw on it taste delicious    And the sauces  My goodness they are to die for  Try every single one  Chimichurri is of course a winner  but favorite is the white garlic one    Bonus  I love the fact that they achieve super savory and flavorful food without tons of mayo and cheese   At least the cheese is optional   I love that most things are olive oil herb garlic based    We ordered the chicken with a side of grilled vegetables which was obviously tasty  and I hope to get back to try the steak    Disclaimer  If you are looking for a place for sit down service this is not for you  It s a small cozy space with a few stools inside and tables outside and you order at the register  I can t wait to get down when the weather is nicer ,5,2014-02-23
Went with my sister and brother for her birthday   Had read a lot about this place and must say it was even better than expected   Had heard about long lines   but we got lucky   Arrived around   for late lunch early dinner and spent a few minutes trying to decide what we wanted   The plan was to get a lot of different plates and share     Ordered way too much   but everything we had was great  The service and staff were awesome   Had the ribeye and strip steaks   both were very good   Tried all the sauces and they were very good with the red pepper my fave     Liked the wings best of all   so much so that we got another order to go   Had plenty of leftovers which the staff helped us pack up for our trip home  Now we have to go back to try the sandwiches ,5,2016-04-21
Seriously good meat  Extensive menu and efficient ordering process  We had a weekday lunch and were seated very quickly    The flavour of the steak was intense and delicious  It was cooked perfectly to order  Also shared a beautiful burger   Can t wait to go back next time we are in Pittsburgh  Hopefully my Aussie    note is on the wall ,5,2017-05-10
Hands down best meal in Pittsburgh  You more than likely will wait in a ridiculously long line on the weekend but this is one of the few restaurants I would always wait for  The prices are amazing for the quality of the meal  Not to mention the service is outstanding  The steak was cooked to perfection  the shrimp were the best I ve ever had   grilled and seasoned wonderfully  They offer three homemade sauces you can help yourself to  I basically wanted to drink them  The atmosphere of the restaurant only adds to the experience the food already provides   eager  helpful and happy staff  happy customers  delicious food  Gaucho is a must ,5,2019-05-27
Still by far the best steak in Pittsburgh  If you leave here hungry it is your own fault ,5,2017-07-14
My husband and I have been here over a dozen times and love the food  We know to go off peak times so we don t have to wait in line for very long  We arrived on Saturday         around      pm and the line was only to the door so we decided to stay even though it was    degrees   Based on prior visits and the length of the line  we expected to wait about       minutes   Well  over   hour later  we still had not ordered at the counter and  in hindsight  should have left  as many other people did      We know that they often time orders  but this time it was excessive  We over heard the lady taking orders tell a couple in front of us that they were taking turns with live orders  those of us in the restaurant  and then phone orders   Well  when we were next in line  she immediately took our order   We counted     clean and open tables both upstairs and downstairs at any given time while we were in line    Once we ordered  we payed by credit card and were immediately prompted to leave a tip when we signed   Apparently  there is a way to not leave a tip but it was not a clear option on the screen and would not let me complete the transaction without leaving a tip   Manager later said there s a way to not leave a tip and that should have been explained to us    We were led to our table after ordering and told there was water on the table  After waiting and waiting  no one brought water so I had to get up and ask for water  I was handed a bottle of water and told the guy we also needed glasses and he pointed to them on the shelf    I ve worked in the restaurant business  I get it   But  have common decency and communicate to your patrons if wait time are excessively long or the kitchen is backed up  Offer water to those people waiting in line outside your restaurant in    degree heat since this is the business model you want to follow   Do you know how many people left the line  I can only imagine how much money this place loses from this business model  Maybe they just don t care and that s okay    I spoke to a manager before leaving and was told   sorry  sorry  Next time you come  hopefully you will have a better experience    WOW  Too bad he ASSUMES we will be back  The next     we spend for our meal will now go to other great restaurants in Pittsburgh that focus more on their customer satisfaction ,1,2019-09-22
The food at Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is literally other worldly  I m so happy for the Yelp event that introduced me to this restaurant   My coworker and I came here for her birthday in late January  We were a little surprised to walk into the restaurant and find seating for less than    people  Thankfully  a lot of people ordering were picking up takeout to take back to their offices  so we were able to snag some bar stools   We began chatting it up with the    owner  I forget    who had also been at the Yelp event several months prior  telling him that we had to check out the restaurant after tasting the food at the event  He is such a friendly  outgoing  eccentric kind of guy and is a lot of fun to talk to  He told us all about Gaucho s expansion plans  I can t wait for Gaucho to take over the neighboring space so that there will be more seating in the restaurant   Let s get to the food    We ordered Steak Empenadas  Provoletta  Vegetales  Rosemary Braised Beef Sandwich  and Camarones  Even though we had enough food to feed   people  we somehow inhaled almost all of it  The Steak Empenadas were wrapped in a flaky pastry and filled with a flavorful steak mixture  The Vegetales were tasty  roasted vegetables covered in balsamic vinegar  The Camarones were flavorful shrimp cooked in simple seasonings  My friend ordered the Rosemary Braised Beef Sandwich  but since I m not a horseradish fan  I only stole a bite or two and let her enjoy the rest  The only item that didn t totally knock my socks off was the Provoletta  There was nothing wrong with the dish   toast covered in provolone with arugula on the side   but it just didn t impress me like the other items did   The food was so good that we just couldn t resist getting dessert  When Gaucho heard that it was my friend s birthday  they gave her the Alfajores cookies  We didn t try them until we had returned to work that afternoon  and they were the perfect hit the spot melt in your mouth afternoon treat  The Panqueques were sweet crepes filled with a whole lot of caramel and topped with chocolate drizzle  This dessert just requires a love of caramel  The Crema Quemada   aka Creme Brulee   was perfectly smooth and creamy and crunchy   I can t wait to return to Gaucho and bring my husband here to try all the delicious food  He was disappointed that I came without him  and I know that he ll be blown away the same way that I was ,5,2015-03-03
This was one of the most amazing restaurant finds ever  and the food was nothing short of exceptional  I wanted to come here for every meal afterwards it was so tasty  It is an interesting ordering process where you wait in line and place your order first thing   then you are seated  The meat was so good   all the chimichurri sauces were mouth watering  We also tried the pork empanada of the day and some chorizo  This place was simply phenomenal  They don t have a liquor license  so you can bring your own bottle of wine and with no corkage fee either  Unbuckle your belt and dig in  it s delectable ,5,2019-07-25
Let me just start by saying if you haven t been to Gaucho yet you need to get there ASAP  All the hype is real  I was hesitant to give this restaurant a try as I am not a big meat eater and the menu is mostly meat  However  I had to give it a try since it s the    rated restaurant in Pittsburgh for         My first visit I got the Bondiola sandwich  The meat paired with the ciabatta bread was just spectacular  It was made even better by dipping it in the dipping sauces they have available  I also tried one of the steak empanadas which was also delicious    My second visit I tried the pollo sandwich but I wasn t as impressed with it  I also tried my friends grilled veggies which I would highly recommend    As for the service and environment   the service is very quick and we did not wait long to get our food either time  I ve heard a lot of people say the line here gets crazy so keep that in mind because my guess is the line moves fairly quickly  I personally had no wait because I got there at      and  pm before the rush started  The restaurant is very cute but not really a place for a big group ,5,2016-02-22
Highly recommend this to anyone    Best foods I ve tried so far on my trip  Thanks for such a great experience ,5,2019-01-31
Favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh  Very affordable  great meat  and it s byob  Would recommend anything on the menu and it s always cooked to perfection ,5,2019-02-21
Over hyped   Dishes are too expensive for what you get   Got a salad with shrimp for over       Got four pieces of shrimp  very small slice of avocado  and little else   The atmosphere is decent   I don t know what else you want me to say ,2,2019-03-09
My wife and I went a few weeks back after Gaucho was featured on local news food feature  Being hispanic and recent transplants from Texas this place was a must try    The place itself is unassuming but very clean and smells great  It was cramped during lunch hours on a weekday but all outside space was closed due to snow  When the outside is open and downstairs lounge is done this place will be less tight  We didn t mind the tight spaces because the food is absolutely worth the wait  You won t get traditional churrasceria steak served from a skewer here but the meat that ends up on the plate holds up the true argentinian standards and flavors   We shared the rosemary braised beef sandwich and added a grilled corn and two vegetable empanadas  they were out of stock of beef ones  for sides  I was THOROUGHLY impressed at the food    It was delightful to eat and portioned generously such that the two of us had a nice filling lunch despite splitting  The empanadas  although veg  were well seasoned and cooked and generally  southwestern  in flavor profile due to choice of chiles and black beans  Our grilled corn was gently coated in salted butter with just the right amount of creaminess to the smoky bites of corn  The braised beef itself and the bread it was served on were the absolute highlight  Every bite was tender and full of rich marinade and rubbed spices and complimented well by both the chimichurri or aioli sauces provided  It was a damn good sandwich  simply said   We will definitely be returning  I hope that they get more space but it s in no ways a deal breaker ,4,2015-04-03
The steak is top notch   Really chill atmosphere  A great place to go with a group   ,5,2018-05-25
My husband and I went here while I was on the keto diet  Lots of low carb options  He ordered the sandwich and said it was the best he ever had  I ordered the steak and that was good  but next time I will be sure to try the sandwich   I love how they leave the sauces out so you can refill as much as you want   Along with the water    We can t wait to return  ,5,2019-01-17
Not only delicious  affordable food  but an incredibly pleasant staff  Looking forward to their expansions as the only problem right now is the lack of seating  I would avoid it during the peak lunch hours as you will have to wait a decent amount of time   Favorite is the skirt steak sandwich with a side of corn ,5,2014-10-25
I went here with two co workers for lunch on a Friday afternoon   We had to drive around the block a few times to find a parking space as the Strip gets very busy around lunch time   My co worker said this is his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh so I had high expectations   We had to wait outside because if was very crowded for the lunch hour   I thought this was a good sign   I don t eat red meat and none of the sandwiches appealed to me so I ordered a large side of grilled vegetables  roasted potatoes  and grilled corn on the cob   The vegetables were black and mushy because they were so overcooked   They had a good flavor and the optional sauces were tasty  but it was hard to overcome that they were so grossly overdone   The potatoes were also overcooked and blackened with way too much rosemary seasoning   I had to brush a lot of the seasoning off of them so they could even be edible   The corn was the best part of the meal as it was the only thing cooked and seasoned appropriately   My other co worker ordered the carne sandwich and was happy with it   His potatoes were also overdone and over seasoned   My vegetarian co worker ordered the same thing as I did and also commented that the vegetables were overcooked   I think this place is probably great if you re a meat lover  but probably not the best choice for vegetarians   If I go again  I ll give the chicken sandwich a try  but with so many other great options in this area I m not sure if I ll be back ,2,2016-07-01
Oh my god   Yes   This place smells AMAZING as you walk up to it  I was excited before entering bc I knew it was going to be good   The place is tiny inside   There s outdoor seating  but it was raining  and there are maybe   bar stool spots indoors   So there s that  but that doesnt take away from the   star rating  and I overheard someone say they are moving into a larger space next door   My father ordered the ribeye with a side of mushrooms  and I had the flank steak sandwich   Both were amazing   Smoky  moist  flavorful  these adjectives sound so creepy used together but it was like a cornucopia of delicious on my place   I can t believe I haven t been here sooner   I declared that from now on  I only eat at Gaucho but then my bank account was like   LOL  no    This place isn t cheap but who wants discount meat   Don t even get me started about the chimmichurri sauce   It was divine   You need to eat here  trust me ,5,2014-09-15
Please open a location in Milwaukee   This place was amazing   I love how it can be an easy going casual lunch or you could BYOB for a pricier dinner  The sauces were delightful  steak sandwich delightful  empanadas delightful  Anyone who comes to Pittsburgh I am suggesting that they come here ,5,2019-08-14
We stopped by for lunch    wow   Super tender beef with tons of fresh yummy sides   The people there are very relaxed and there is a fun vibe ,5,2019-01-05
Everything is wonderful  just be sure to get there early or you will be waiting in line  but even if you do get stuck in line   worth it ,5,2019-08-27
Amazing food   I usually get the small El Gaucho salad with flank steak   All of the sauces are excellent   Get there early because the line is out the door otherwise ,5,2019-06-14
We had our eyes on this place for about a year before we worked it out to stop in  We were down in Pgh to see Phantom of the Opera  without the kids  so the timing was perfect  We ended up ordering several empanadas and a couple sampler plates then sharing everything  Don t miss the dipping sauces in the dining area  lots of tasty combos to try  The plates are simple but they re delicious and more filling than they look like  If you can  try a variety and share ,5,2019-04-28
Great restaurant  Bit more affordable than a full Argentinian restaurant  The lines for lunch can be very busy  I once waited for a full hour  I recommend going at nights and off hours  The empanadas are crispy  I love their bife de gaucho ,5,2018-07-10
Whenever I am asked for restaurant recommendations I always mention Gaucho  Meats are always perfectly cooked with a great selection of unique sauces that are all self serve while dining  and can be bought for future use  The restaurant itself is relatively small making it chaotic in front of the register during their peak hours   over all the staff is excellent  atmosphere is fun  and they have one of the best   most affordable steak sandwiches in Pittsburgh ,4,2019-01-30
Awesome   worth wait  which moved faster than I expected   Staff very friendly  Can t wait to go back   I ordered the Rosemary braised beef and side of Brussels sprouts  Delicious  Love the bacon on the Brussels sprouts ,5,2016-01-16
Worth the Wait  Waited in line for about    minutes in the sun and goodness every second we had to wait was worth it  They have a sign on the entrance explaining that space is limited so patience is key    I had the steak burger  cooked medium rare  with grilled onions and bleu cheese  Super flavorful and perfectly cooked  The sandwich was the perfect amount of food   If you have the time to wait in line I would certainly recommend checking out Gaucho the next time you are in Pittsburgh ,5,2019-07-01
This is by far the best restaurant that I have been to in Pittsburgh   The staff is very laid back and creates a straightforward but friendly atmosphere   Any time I have guests in from out of town  I make it a point to take them to Gaucho   My favorite menu item is the Carne sandwich   You get to choose the cut of steak on your sandwich and there is no upcharge   I usually end up with a Filet Mignon steak sandwich for       The sides are easily shareable   Our go to is always the potatoes  some corn on the cob  and one of their rotating vegetables   The desserts are also fantastic  although they do rotate   I usually go with whatever seasonal bread pudding they offer ,5,2016-09-17
So  Where to start  Well I ll start by saying  EVERYTHING was amazing  Like wow  First of all we did wait in line for a good    mins  But if any restaurant has a line  You KNOW it s gonna be good  We went at   and the line was still very long  But it got even longer as the night went on  But anyways for the food  I order the filet mignon  medium  and it was probably the best steak I ve EVER had  They made it sooooo good  The outside of the steak had a nice char to it  but the middle had just enough pink  And it was just filled with juice  It was so freaking good  The salad that came with it was delicious  It was very fresh  And ya know how some salads are chewy when they use real greens  well this one wasn t  It was very light and tasty and just great  I also ordered the carrots with goat cheese  and omg  These were sooooo good  Idk where they get their cheese but holy crap  So good  It was like a dessert  And I also ordered an empanada and that was also delicious  But so if your deciding if you want to wait it out in that huge line  just do it  ,5,2019-04-28
By far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh  You can taste the flame in all of their meets and the sauces make the already good food exceptional  I recommend the qui qui chicken for anyone that has not eaten here before but I really haven t had anything that wasn t delicious,5,2019-08-03
The     steak came with no sides except bread which I had to ask for twice and was over salted  The portion was very small too  Very disappointed,1,2018-06-30
Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is a must go to experience to have while you are in Pittsburgh  Don t let the long line out the door fool you  It goes fast  and is worth every second of wait time  The food is absolutely delicious and flavorful  They have an assortment of homemade sauces you can get on the side that really go well with just about everything served there  This establishment is also BYOB  so feel free to bring a bottle of wine  etc  to go with your meal  I also liked the process this restaurant has set up  You wait in line  choose your items  get your drinks and pay upfront  They will give you a table number  so you go find whatever table you d like and they will deliver your food when it s ready  After you are all finished  you just leave  Very simple    Can t say enough about the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff  The staff put their heart and soul into their work when preparing meals  I highly recommend this place to anyone    This would be a good place for a date  or a small group of friends  etc  The atmosphere is intimate and nice ,5,2019-09-24
This place rocks  yes you have to wait in line but trust me goes quick and it is worth it ,4,2019-08-31
wait too long outside   steak and bread are burnt and it taste bitter  The chicken has no taste inside              ,2,2019-12-01
Believe the hype  Totally authentic vibe  Incredible smokey  grilled flavors  Delicious sauces and seasonings  This is a meat lovers paradise ,5,2014-09-06
Great food  HORRIBLE service for the following reasons  all of the below were after spending            After waiting     hours in line  we had a standoffish waiter who was rude  abrupt  and obnoxious  seated at        see below for the rest  of timeline   Waiter s name is Patrick      After finishing dinner  they didn t clear any plates and instead  basically put the bread putting dessert on top of the unfinished paella    They started putting chairs up on the empty tables around us at     pm  this was a SATURDAY NIGHT FYI     We asked for an extra chair for a friend who was coming to meet us for drinks  this was at         remember that we got seated at        they said no   HERES THE WORST PART  sorry we ve been here for   hours and want to go home so we re locking the doors  No more guests allowed   We then ask for the manager      Manager refuses to come  waitress comes back and says  sorry my manager supports me      and doesn t want to come up  sorry bye  ,1,2018-12-16
Great service  AMAZING food  Loved the empanadas and the lamb chops    the steak sandwich was the best I ve ever eaten   Incredible chimchurri and garlic dipping sauce ,5,2017-05-21
I m Argentinian  so when I heard there was a restaurant in Pittsburgh that served Argentinian meat  I was ecstatic  It s really hard to find beef and steaks in America that match the texture and flavor of Argentinian steak  There is a world of difference between how cows are grazed  and therefore how they taste  in America and in Argentina  A few details     Argentinian cows are actually of a different breed than American cows     Argentinian cows eat zero corn  Nothing  None  Cows can t process corn well  which is why in America cows need a ton of antibiotics to survive     Argentinian cows live in large  flat plots of green and healthy land  rather than in cages or small plots of land  Because of these reasons  no matter how you cook American beef  it will never taste like Argentinian beef  The food at El Gaucho is pretty good  don t get me wrong  but it would be a stretch to call it Argentinian  I couldn t recognize at least half the items in the menu  The chimichurri  as well as the chorizo  didn t taste quite like it does back home  I heard the owner is American and actually lived in Brazil for a long time  so this may explain the inauthenticity of the food   I bet that for someone who has never been to Argentina  this restaurant will be a good place to eat meat  But for the Argentinians expecting to get a taste of home    don t come  you ll be disappointed ,3,2016-10-25
    stars  Worth the hype  Not really  Delicious  Yes  There are   tables outside here folks  So if you re lucky enough to get one there are constantly people staring at you because they want your seats  When there is a line its mass chaos inside and while the employees are friendly there s a hipster vibe  or something  that didn t feel welcoming  The menu is on a chalkboard right before you order so you have to make a quick decision even though you were standing in line quite a while already   The smells in this place are fantastic and really increased the anticipation  We had the carne sandwich with filet  excellent   the hangar steak lunch  very good and with a salad   veggie empanadas  just ok  and fungos  solid   Portions were generous  Overall  I d go back but I m not going to be raving to anyone about the experience ,3,2014-11-11
Wow   What an experience for the family while visiting Pittsburgh      Assada platter  chorizo app recommend the spicy    roasted potatoes  empanadas beef and pork  and salad delivered     The kids cleaned up the beef empanadas   We wish we got more ,5,2019-07-27
As good as it gets  I would gladly go back to Pittsburgh just to have this steak again  My friend used this place to cater her wedding  so with that kind of recommendation I knew I had to check it out  There s street and lot parking nearby  BYOB but also keep in mind that a lot of liquor stores nearby close by   pm  Be prepared to wait in line  which is        worth it    I split the Asado Platter with another person which was honestly the best case scenario  We loved being able to sample all the types of steak and taste the difference between all of them  Out of the five  the loma was my favorite but I would get all of them again just for the experience  Make sure to get all the self serve sauces as well  I would also highly recommend the bread pudding  Such a nice way to end a meal ,5,2019-05-03
      reviews with an average rating of      Does this place really need another bangin  review  DUH  Lol  I need a story to go with all the cool pictures I want to post  In town on business and I wanted a unique place to eat so I do what I normally do  I find out what the most reviewed place is in the area and go there  Here I am     minutes before they closed and there was a line out the door a little up the block  Fun Fact  Before closing someone will come outside to assess the line  They will then hand the last person a medium sized board with a Johnny Bravo picture on it that says  End of the Line   With this great power comes great responsibility  It s their job to turn everyone who tries to get in line  away  You get a free t shirt out the deal  It was hilarious and I had never seen anything like it before  The funny part is  people actually respected the sign  being held by an ordinary customer whom they ve never met before  People CAN be kinda awesome   Atmosphere Appearance  Set right on the corner of Penn Ave and the David McCullough Bridge is this place  Apartments above it and a very simple concept  Walk up to the counter  order your food then you go sit down and wait for it to come to you  The menu is GIGANTIC in size and posted as soon as you walk in the door  You can see it for pretty much down the street  Lol  High ceilings  bright woods and a few plants decorate the inside  There are   main eating areas  One in the front right by the menu and the second is up some stairs toward the back  As busy as it was  it wasn t very loud  Just the sound of normal conversation   Service  Like I mentioned earlier there isn t much service  You order and it gets brought to you  Cuts out the need for a tip right  Lol  Everyone was very friendly though and super helpful explaining the things on the menu if you struggle with ordering   Food  I wanted to try several things since I can t remember what Argentinian food may taste like  I ordered all of these at once and here they are in no particular order  The Qui Qui Chicky is  two chicken legs and two thighs with ancient alien quiquirimichi sauce from outer space and grilled lemons   It was phenomenal  I don t think I ve ever had grilled chicken that was so tasty  so seasoned and so    awesome  Chorizos were next up  They re hefty sausages  You can get them in a sweet or spicy variety  The come with grilled red peppers  caramelized onions  toast and pimenton sauce  They come in orders of      or    These were also incredible  Like  can this place just not disappoint   Moving on  I also ordered the Camarones which are cast iron seared shrimp with rosemary  garlic and lemon  They come in a small and large portion  I wound up with the small since I was trying a variety of other things  but they were quite good  Shrimp can be hard to season  I probably would stray away from these in the future  but give them a try  I needed my vegetables so I tried the roasted cauliflower which comes with chili oil  scallions and lemon juice  Delightful  Light  flavorful and you don t feel bad eating a lot of it  Lol  Last  but not least was their Maiz  it s basically street corn that s grilled with olive oil  salt and pepper  The food was all incredible  I want to try everything on their menu  but my eye is set on that quintuplet of steaks next time   Value  Not too bad  but can get spend y if you wanna try multiple things  Maiz         Roasted Cauliflower         Camarones   Small        Large        Chorizos                            Qui Qui Chicky           This place was freaking awesome  I was able to dine with   gentleman I randomly met in line so we all shared a table  not food  Lol  I d love to come back here time and time again to explore the rest of the menu ,5,2018-08-29
Great place and so delicious food  I love this restaurant  The sauces are so cool and very yummy  Especially the onion sauce  We ordered the ribeye small and pescado plate  Not too many roasted vegetables  Will try others next time  Thanks ,5,2018-06-05
Another   star little spot in Pittsburgh  My brother found this place on yelp when they came to visit me and we went before the remodel  It was a tiny place  only seating was outside but it was well worth the cramped quarters  I got the lomo  filet  sandwich and added some chimichuri sauce for a delish finish  The sandwich itself was a ton of meat  cooked to perfection and the chimichuri was a nice spicy fresh finish  A  on the sandwich  Loved the ambiance of the small place too  menu written on the chalkboard  loud cooks and a friendly guy taking my order   I recently went back and found that they were remodeling  I didn t know and was disappointed that I didn t get to fulfill my Argentinian steakhouse sandwich needs for that day  BUT I went back and LOVE LOVE LOVE what they did with the place  They moved right next door into the vacant building that was next to them  I think it may have been another restaurant at some point  The decorations are adorable  very Latin American retro  They have expanded their menu to include salads  appetizers  veggies and other items  including breakfast   There was already a line at    on Sunday when they were getting ready to open  We were first in line and I couldn t help myself and had to get the Carne con Pan  So steak  bread  onions  red peppers and chimichurri  I had the filet again and my partner had the ribeye  Both were delish and spot on  I also ordered some grilled corn  which was also spot on   Can t say enough good things about this place  Will continue to frequent and hope their business thrives  they deserve it ,5,2015-07-24
This place is stellar  We ve been here a couple of times and stopped in today while running errands in the Strip  Like always  there were numerous people eating and then experiencing food nirvana  you know  when your eyes flutter and roll in the back of your head  and you can t speak for a solid minute because your taste buds are break dancing  Nirvana   We got the Chanchito  the Ribeye with the casa salad  a steak empanada and the fungus side dish  We ate it at the store and I collected all of the little dips that they offer  The ajo sauce  just pure garlic goodness  was hands down my favorite  They had another sauce  a red color  that was pureed sweet red peppers  which was equally amazing   The atmosphere was really positive also  The owner is usually at the front of the house  making sure that everyone is having a pleasant time and continually shouts out positive affirmations    All in all  the food is spectacular and it was an awesome time  Definitely will be back  ,5,2014-11-06
I feel like I arrived pretty late to this party  At least we re there now  Clearly it was better late than never    I held off in the beginning because past experience with Argentinean restaurants had been underwhelming   typical seemed to always be piles upon piles of mediocre meat  Well I stand corrected  This isn t what they deliver at Gaucho  Here you get incredible flavors infused into their meat dishes with well thought out sides and enhancements also packing a punch for your taste buds    We had the good fortune to sample   of their dishes at a Yelp Elite event held at The Pittsburgh Winery  The guys from Gaucho were memorable in personality and their food was absolutely unforgettable    I ordered their skirt steak which comes with a salad and bread at their restaurant the other day and honestly I may have to order it several more times before I ll be able to stray to other menu items  Yep  that perfect   I have no idea how much effort goes into making that skirt steak taste this amazing but I know I certainly will be eating this again   again  It came served over mushrooms and onions that were also infused with all that flavor  Home run   It s very obvious that the team who works here love what they do and their enthusiasm is pretty contagious  They are beyond thrilled that something they enjoy doing so much has been so well received by our city  They started off with such a small space that it s been tough to get in   another reason it took us so long to get here  Soon that will change when they expand their space next door  It s a classic success story  start small doing amazing food  crowds will come   you grow your business    We will return to Gaucho   next time it won t take so long ,5,2015-03-14
Best foodie spot in Pittsburgh  Yes  the wait is long  Really long  so y all can step out of line and go down the street to McDonald s   I ll wait ,5,2016-01-26
Phenomenal  Saturday mornings afternoons will be tough getting seats  but food is delicious ,4,2017-03-14
This is by FAR the best restaurant in Pittsburgh  Bug claim I know but everything is amazing  A bit pricey but worth it  Great flavor  BBQ  South American fusion food ,5,2016-10-21
Very tasty sandwich  Can be very busy with limited seating  but worth it  Make sure you have time ,5,2018-01-07
Argentina salad  You would think getting a salad at a steak based place would be a mistake  Key to a good salad is veggies and there was so much good stuff and even potatoes with rosemary   Rosemary braised sandwich was delicious  Caramelized onions made it perfect  Bread was incredible  The sauces are plentiful and the best I ve ever had  The vibe is awesome and clean  Super friendly people here  And the girl up front is hot  Dark hair with bangs I m looking at you    ,5,2015-08-21
Typically I have fun eating out but rarely do I feel that the price is warranted given what I could make it home  This is the only restaurant I ve ever been to where I felt like the price really represented something amazing it was very cheap for the quality and some of the best food I ve had in a long time  We came in well before   o clock   probably      at least   and by   there was a huge line out the door   Try the desserts  too  They are also amazing ,5,2016-10-24
Great unique spot in Pittsburgh strip district  The people working there are super organized and friendly  So much tasty choices to order from  Don t forget the home made yummy sauces you get yourself and try on your food  If you order the plates instead of the sandwich  get the toast on the side  So many meat options to order  They also carry fish of the day and had mahi mahi when I went  Satisfying  flavorful meal ,5,2019-05-16
This place used to be great but as they ve grown in popularity and in physical space  it s really gone down the tubes  The food is still good  but they ve developed the snobby hipster attitude you d expect in San Francisco  We arrived at      pm on a Saturday  on which they closed at    pm  We were told they weren t accepting anymore customers but managed to finagle our way into seat at a high top in the hallway  We asked for the menu and were told  we don t have menus  you need to look it up online   We proceeded to try and read the lo res photo of a chalkboard menu  Neither of us could actually read any of the descriptions so just crossed our fingers and hoped we would like our order  The experience was downhill from there      The food was fine but everyone from the cashier to the   different waiters we interacted with were down right rude  We will NEVER come back to Gaucho  I won t recommend readers of this post do anything on account of our experience  but I tried to warn you  ,1,2017-11-26
Excellent food at a very reasonable price   not the absolute best in Pittsburgh  but certainly very good ,4,2019-11-09
Tonight was our second night visiting Gaucho  One word to best describe this place   FLAVOR   The food is amazing  I think I could eat the pork tenderloin every day  All that being said dining at Gaucho is unique  Usually the wait is so long you are standing outside on average for    minutes and then an additional    minutes inside  The ambience in the front dining room is fine   there is a lot going on around you with the wait staff and the ordering desk right behind you  The back dining room leaves much to be desired  it really does resemble a fast food joint   Last night was our second time dining at Gaucho  The first time I was so blown away by the food I couldn t wait to go back  But after waiting again and lack of atmosphere we might take a break and go back in a year or so when we have friends in town ,4,2016-06-29
First time visiting Gaucho after hearing great things from friends  It lived up to the hype  It is so hard to decide what to order because everything looks great  We enjoyed it all  amazing flavors  I d recommend Gaucho to anyone ,5,2017-11-05
We wanted to try Argentinian food and were very pleased with the food  I ordered the NY strip medium with a side of oven roasted red potatoes  Absolutely delicious and would certainly eat here again  The sauces were great too ,5,2018-01-18
This place was a solid find  A bit off the beaten path  it s a trek from the convention center but well worth it    Their menu is loaded with authentic argentine dishes and can suit any taste  The queuing tanking system is a bit unorthodox but at lunch it didn t really matter    I had the flank steak meal   it was cooked well and the side salad and veggies were amazing  Make sure you try the chimichurri sauce on your steak and bread ,5,2017-06-03
If you happen to stumble upon my review over any of the other hundreds of reviews for Gaucho  look no further than the average rating for the restaurant and this piece of advice  Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is entirely worth the hype   If you must read further  the story is this  I had been hoping to make it to Gaucho for months but could never squeeze it in during trips back home  Now that I m back in the     for the foreseeable future  I legitimately hope to eat here multiple times a month  I came with a friend during the days immediately proceeding the re opening  I hadn t seen the inside before the re open  but I can say the new restaurant is gorgeous  modern  and well ventilated  take a peek in the kitchen from the street  you d never know there is a wood fire in there from the inside    The day of my visit they had to close down early and re open after prepping more food  This apparently had happened a few times and it feels like the restaurant is getting in its groove to accommodate the larger crowds  The line was long  but we were inside  had ordered  seated and fed within about    minutes  I don t think Gaucho will ever not be busy  so plan accordingly   The staff was incredibly friendly and eager to talk about any piece of the menu  I had the rosemary braised beef con pan  sandwich  and my friend had the bife de gaucho  ribeye  cooked to order  con pan  Everything about my sandwich was perfect  The meat was cooked to tender perfection  the horsey sauce was not overpowering or overused  and the caramelized onion probably spoke to my soul  I only managed to steal one bite of the gaucho con pan  but I suspect I will be getting a whole one for myself in the near future  We shared a side of the corn pudding  a warm  savory and spicy dish that did well to complement the meaty sandwiches   If you made it to the end of this review  I appreciate your patience  and for goodness  sake   go eat at Gaucho ,5,2015-06-03
I ve been going here since it opened a few years ago  Best food in Pittsburgh  They re always adding to the menu  so it never gets boring  Too crowded on a Sat  Best to go during the week or early evenings on the weekends ,5,2015-06-19
Delicious food  This place is worth the wait   friendly staff   quality food  I went here for my birthday in May   loved every bite  ,5,2018-11-17
Where do I even begin with Gaucho  This is one of the best restaurants in the city  and an absolute must try if you haven t been yet   Gaucho is a tiny little place in the Strip that you might miss if you re not looking for it  Often times when you drive past you ll see lines out the door at this small brick building  I actually like the way Gaucho is set up   instead of being seated and having a waiter  you just wait in line to order at the register and then go scope out a table  The employees will call out your order as soon as it s ready  Overall I think this strategy makes the process go a little more quickly  which is good since it s always so packed  They don t take reservations here  but if you come on a weekday before around   PM you shouldn t have to wait long at all  My boyfriend and I came on a Wednesday at      and had no problem finding a table and getting our food in record time  Bring a bottle of wine with you   this is one of the only restaurants in the city that I ve discovered that is truly BYOB  no uncorking fee     I ve been to Gaucho twice now and have been overly impressed with the food both times  Absolutely everything on the menu here is so deliciously flavorful  you honestly can t make a bad choice when deciding what to get  I highly recommend the classic steak sandwich with the rib eye  The roasted vegetables are also a favorite  I have never had such delicious grilled veggies in my life  The steak empanadas are also wonderful  The best part about Gaucho s food  in my opinion  is the way that all the strong flavors mesh together so beautifully  You won t find a bland dish here   This is one of those restaurants in Pittsburgh that I will keep coming back to again and again  If you haven t been  you need to go TODAY ,5,2016-01-28
I had an amazing time here with a college friend  The staff couldn t be more friendly  The bill wasn t too high  And the staff was wonderful  Jean our waiter had an excellent knowledge of the menu and gave us a lot of help sorting through the dishes  I settled on a fish dish and my friend had a steak dish  Both were fantastic  Definitely will be returning ,5,2019-07-04
Delicious steak and vegetables roasted to perfection  Go on a weekday during off hours to avoid a wait  Friendly staff ,5,2017-10-08
At last  I made it to Gaucho  I ve been waiting to check this place out for years  and I m so happy that it lived up to the high expectations that I had for it  The space is small  and yes you will be greeted by a line  The line leads you right to the counter where you are given your drinks  your wine is uncorked for you  BYOB  and you are then someone takes your order on an ipad  The line seemed to move very quickly  mostly because I couldn t choose what to order off of the chalkboard  so so many options    Once we were seated  our food didn t take long to arrive at all  I absolutely loved all of the food that we ordered  We had one main course  which came with a salad  and then we ordered some of the sides and features  Everything was hot  and high quality  There wasn t much service while we were seated  as in  you don t have a specific waiter waitress they all just help each other out with refills and busing tables    The employees here were all extremely friendly  which is always a    star in my book  I loved that this restaurant is BYOB  I expected the decor to be different  would be nice for them to spruce up the place a bit  Also  i would have loved to have some music playing in the background  We sat on the top floor and it was extremely difficult to have a conversation because it was just so noisy with all of the other tables talking    Would highly recommend Gaucho  Check the hours first  they are closed on Sunday and Monday  I can t wait to go back ,5,2018-12-19
Rachel was amazing  great host  Made the time pass easily as it was a long wait  expected at such a famous place  Overall great spot,5,2019-03-21
Third visit for my dear wife s birthday was again outstanding   The carne asada skirt steak was amazing   We tried the campfire yams that really blew our tastebuds away with super charred big marshmallows and potatoes that became uber carmelized in the fire   OMG   Just delicious   And the beans and greens and side of mushrooms was stellar   We love their sauces and their servers cannot be beat   We arrived around  pm on a Saturday and waited an hour to order and be seated   It goes pretty quickly because there is always some primo people watching to be had   Just love you Gaucho ,5,2018-11-21
I don t see what the big hype is   If you like under seasoned  over cooked  over priced steak  than this place is for you   Ordered multiple medium rare rib eyes for the table and every one was grey on the inside and basically tasted only of charcoal unless slathered in the house sauces  Chicken was pretty good though   Lol,2,2019-05-19
This place is a meat lovers heaven  I enjoyed my food and encourage everyone to visit this place when in the area ,5,2019-07-06
Did I really forget to review this place   Been here a couple times  I very rarely get to the Strip  but I have much more of a reason to go now that I ve found this place    LOVE the grilled veggies  I feel like their  thing  is meat  but wow these veggies are amazing  I am not the type to choose a veggie sandwich  but after having some of them on a salad on my first trip  I went for it the next trip  and I didn t miss the meat  I also love their bread  I love unique eats  and this fits the bill  Nothing too bizarre  but def not your usual fare  either  Wish I could go more often ,5,2016-11-02
Definite   stars      I would even give them    or     stars if I could  If you haven t been then stop reading this and go    I had the Rosemary Beef sandwich  Oh my goodness    Lots and lots of goodness   The sandwich was huge   My husband and I split it  The beef had to have been marinated and then slow cooked  I don t like to cook but I would definitely want the recipe to make is  The bun held up to all of the roast beef  That was good because there was a lot of roast beef   My husband ordered the Pollo ala Parilla  It is a grilled chicken  but it s not what we as Americans think of as grilled chicken  It had the skin on which was crispy  You could taste the lemon and thyme  The chicken fell right off the bone  And you definitely want to lick all of that goodness off of your fingers   We shared coleslaw  It was a big helping  You start eating it and you are thinking of how good the crunchiness is and the sweet sour combination and just as you swallow you start to sense the after burn  It s a deep spiciness  It was a compliment to both of our meals   There are a lot of other options on the menu and we want to try them all but we really want to take friends back to try the Pallella ,5,2016-04-25
I had to visit several times before I was ready to review  OK  so first off  Gaucho can be amazing  But you need to go with a group  It s not really the place to go as a couple or alone  The reason for going in a group is to try lots of what they have to offer  When I went the first time it was just me and my husband  and we were underwhelmed   it was expensive and we didn t really get much variety as you just order at a counter and your food comes to your table all at once so its not a coursed dining experience  That said  I have now gone several times with a large group  it s not expensive  and we get a ton of food to share  Get you and your friends a few Asado platters  some potatoes  some shrimp  provaletta  and dig into their sauces  which are amazing  Remember to bring your wine  and come early or be prepared to wait in a long line  Four and a half stars   if they had table service it would be five ,4,2018-11-15
Padilla Gaucho is a   mazing  saw it listed as a top     Yelps actually    in PITTSBURGH   YUP Pittsburgh    I grew up in Pitt  and have been back and forth once every few years for about    years  I had to try it  I went yesterday      with my sister  I had an idea where it was  I knew the area very well  beginning of the  strip  old old building  they are expanding into the next space this spring and have a pation on the opposite side weather permitting   If you are not going right to it and know its there you would walk by    out of     times  FIRST THING   if the braised beef is available do not hesitate  eat this sandwich   Flavors out of this world  Caramelized onions  Horseradish sauce  You will not eat s better sandwich   But get there early they do sell out of this one  Ate this sandwich on my third visit because it was sold out the first two times I was there     I had the Tilapia plate fire grilled   nice size portions  with carmelized onions   greens  asparagus  grilled tomato they have a little sauce bar    mason jars  but do your self a favor and try each on your meal   sandwich  they each have solid flavors    Tilapia was grilled perfectly  which is not easy to do with this very thin white fish  also ordered the Provelleta  sharp provolone on crisp grilled bread  Sister ordered the steak burger well done and it was again made perfectly hanging right on the edge of well and medium  they give you many options for add ons  she had greens and pickled onions and sharp prov  I could not even speak when the food came out it looked amazing and tasted even better  The staff was so friendly and talkative  never felt like we were being rushed or bothering them  George took our order and walked us thru the whole process again never trying to move us along even as the small area was filling up behind us  He was very kind to every single person that came thru    well folks  the next day  I had to go back this place is addictive  took niece and sister back in today and was greeted with  two days in a row Bob  George greeted us  sister  creature of habit  had the steak  burger again but with some different add ons  I went for the Spanish prosciutto  and niece had the picked chicken  pulled  all these have lived up to the billing as this place makes nothing shabby  Spanish prosciutto is a tad less salty than US or Italian  sharp provolone tops it and I added carmelized onions   Picked chicken was moist and exploding with flavor  we actually cut the sandwiches in  rds so we could try each one   EAT HERE         PERIOD    ,5,2015-02-28
I did a roadtrip from Chicago with a friend over   days and this was my favorite restaurant by far  We got the rosemary braised beef sandwich  chicken empanada  and argentino salad with flank beef added as a side  Minds blown  The chicken empanada and the Argentino salad were stellar  The beef sandwich was great       but the other ones were      especially with the different sauces  we tried them all and they were all so good    Highly  highly recommend  Wish they would open a location in Chicago     there s nothing like it here ,5,2018-10-19
The simplicity of the food and the way it s prepared is what makes it so great  Haven t eaten anything here that I haven t loved ,5,2016-12-30
Welcome to hipster hell   This place seems like it is always packed with a line outside the door  However the line is more due to unqualified staff than it is  actual demand  The people taking your order seem to go on a union break or a pause on a regular basis when they think the kitchen is busy or they just need a smoke break or pause    Also really appreciate the guy who took my order and told me all about how sick he was with a fever while taking the order  Really hope this guy was not also preparing my food    As for the food it was great  If you can put up with questionable service and a hipster crowd then by all means try this place ,3,2017-04-01
An incredible restaurant in Pittsburgh  This BYOB  Argentinian restaurant took us way too long to get to  as locals  We got four small plates  the flank steak  the sirloin  the Cerdo  pork with carmelized onion   Dijon  and the Provoletta  grilled provolone cheese   The sirloin and the cerdo were outstanding  The flavor in all of our dishes rendered me speechless  We highly recommend getting a few small plates to try together  The menu is so extensive  you d be cheating yourself if you didn t  It s pricier but it s worth it  Tip  get there early before      on a weeknight and avoid the rush       we will definitely return ,5,2019-09-04
The good  The food was really good  We tried a little of everything  Skirt steak  excellent  perfectly cooked  with the house salad  funghi  yummy   papas  the potatoes were fine but I loved the addition of the rosemary and grilled garlic   beef empanada  flavorful   vegetable empanada  subtle   not bad   and the grilled provolone  awesome   Once we ordered  the food arrived promptly   Parking was easy to find  They allow you to bring your own beer wine and don t even charge a corkage fee  The coffee was dark and smooth and perfect    The not so good  I guess it s their shtick but I just don t understand why they think I d want to wait in line like cattle to order at the counter before I am seated  then have someone yell my name across a crowded room while I m chatting with my lunch mate   We only ended up eating here because we happened to get here when the line was still only inside the front door  And the line moves SUPER slow  I get that it s a small place so there s going to be a wait  but either let me make reservations or take my number and text me when it s ready  So unfortunately  I m not likely to come back  there s just too many other options without the wait ,3,2017-05-08
Believe the hype  It is absolutely as good as everyone says it is ,5,2017-11-16
This place is amazing   I definitely recommend  We got Ribeye  chicken  and mussels  each was better than the other ,5,2019-07-13
GREAT food  There is nothing bad  The only thing I d say  is that the line is very long  so make sure to get there early  I don t believe they have reservations either ,4,2019-10-09
I went to Gaucho Parilla two weekends in a row    the first time was forgettable  I got the rosemary braised beef sandwich which was only ok   but the second time was soooo good   I hear that they used to be much smaller and not really have seating  but the new place  although there is a wait  has basic seating after you ve ordered at the front  and the servers are all so nice and helpful   As everyone has said  GET THE STEAK SANDWICH  We got the ribeye cut  and it was a spectacular slab of beef  Juicy  tender  delicious  All the adjectives of greatness for a steak   We also got a pretty well dressed and well seasoned salad  which was as satisfying as a side salad can get  and the humita  corn pudding with chilis and fresh herbs   The humita was addictive  a bit sweet  a bit savory  a bit spicy  and entirely delicious  I d highly recommend that as well       stars rounded up because the steak sandwich and the humita are truly remarkable ,5,2015-09-01
Very disappointing service   we arrived and sat down only to be told there was no table service and to join the queue  which was by now longer than when we came in   being there first  would have been nice to be advised earlier and escorted to the queue    rather than told oh you are now last as you missed your spot on the queue   but there was no queue or line when we came in   rude and definitely not Argentinean    should be more organized and patron friendly   this put us off and we left     Definitely won t be coming back    ,1,2018-12-04
I have a couple good things to say  a couple not so good things to say   However  Everything aside our lasting impression was made the last few moments as we were about to leave the waitress approached our group spread out her     dollar tip and said  this is all you left   just wanted you to know  If that s okay with you then fine  I just did a lot    I did not drink that evening  everyone else took advantage of the BYOB  Someone in my group handed her    more dollars    before I could stop them   The cash she claimed to  have left over  as her tip didn t match with The money she was given  Additionally  she did not include the     dollars in off those who paid with a credit card   I won t be back  it was so uncomfortable  And I feel she was dishonest  whether by mistake in counting wrong or on purpose  In general not okay    Update  this took place in the downstairs bodega  Never have been to the upper portion of the restaurant ,1,2018-11-16
Very nice staff and atmosphere on the interior   wish there was a little more room to sit though  Regardless  the beef sandwich had a lot of potential but it fell short due to a lack of balance in two major categories  texture and flavor profile  This was mostly caused by the roasted red peppers and sauteed onions  Having three smokey ingredients on a bun is a bit overpowering and was too overwhelming on my palate  Concurrently  these roasted peppers and onions combined with the soft meat and bread robbed every bite of a much desired crunch  having cast ironed vegetables would have been a much more welcome exchange   I also felt the onions were overcharred   With all that in mind  I d still gladly come back here and try it again  Nice people ,4,2013-03-14
Visiting Pittsburgh for a conference and dropped by here for lunch  It was my first time trying Argentinian cuisine and I really liked the food  place   the people  Will definitely recommend to others,5,2019-08-06
Wow  It doesn t get much better than this  The steak platters were phenomenal    of us each tried the flank  filet and NY Strip  with small salad and piece of toast  however the chimichurri sauce on the steaks was a flavor bomb  Comes in two sizes  oz and   oz  The roasted carrots  with honey and feta  side dish is not to be missed  as was the spicy chorizo and empanadas  Do forget the superb flan for dessert  Incredibly inexpensive given the quality       for     BYOB  Brought a bottle and they gladly opened and served in wine glasses with no corkage fee  I can see why there is a line out the door and down the block even on weekdays    Have an unusual system  You queue in line  no reservations   winding past menu chalkboard  You approach cash register and pay  getting any drinks  including water   If you brought a bottle of wine you give it to them  After paying your bill  you wait at the cash register until they seat you at a table  When we got to the table  wine glasses were already present and wine opened  Food was served quickly as it was being prepared while waiting for a table  Service was excellent   contemporary casual atmosphere  Wait was    min at  pm on a Tuesday  Easy walk from Homewood Suites   Highly recommended ,5,2019-04-20
By far the the best steak I have ever had   Every time I am in the area it s a definite go to place   I can t say enough good things about this place and the food    It s on point and Definitley worth the wait in line    I can t wait to go there again ,5,2019-07-22
First off I probably venture to Gaucho s no less than   times a month if not more for lunch during the week  not because of the close proximity to work  but for the exquisite lunch food at a decent price  Gaucho Parilla opens up at      am but you should wander over if you don t want to wait in line  preferably   minutes before     This leaves you ample time to browse over the  chalkboard  menu on the wall  A couple of suggestions  if you are overwhelmed by the menu   Appetizers  I would suggest the  beef or chicken  Empanadas or Provolleta  Lunch  Haven t had a bad sandwich yet but my go to is the Rosemary Braised Beef and the Carne   Also  their wings are smoked and grilled with the sauce layered after cooking    They offer   main sauces set in various places around the restaurant that you can grab and taste to your liking   If you are looking for a quick bite or a sit down lunch with friends this is the place  A modern  yet rustic look  topped with friendly employees and reasonable prices leaves this as a go to for me every time ,5,2019-04-16
We had a party of     and despite the huge lines  were accommodated happily and efficiently  Food was delicious as well  Would       recommend ,5,2019-05-08
Great food   Worth stopping by   The mahi mahi and steak dinner were wonderfully made ,5,2015-02-28
What can really be said that hasn t already   Went for my birthday  Had wine  had meat  had sides  had A BLAST         It was incredible ,5,2017-08-09
Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is a very unique little restaurant with a lot of flavor  I can see why it is so popular  but since I m vegan and can t partake in the  full  experience which would likely include their meats  I also can t  So take my review with a grain of salt    And some of their delicious sauces because that stuff is ADDICTING    Since I m on the topic  Gaucho Parilla Argentina has four free flowing sauces available to all patrons  I probably consumed too much of the ajo garlic one because it was out of this world  It was creamy but not in a weird way and the garlic was subtle and blended so well that I drizzled  ok  drenched  my food in this sauce  I also love the chimi sauce  but I have a feeling it goes together much better with meats than the veggies I ordered    Speaking of which  I ordered the beans and greens as a side for    and the large Argentino Salad for      The prices are pretty awesome  My boyfriend ordered meat things  and he seemed to really enjoy them  I absolutely loved the beans and greens because they had an awesome smoky flavor  so I didn t really feel like I was missing out by not partaking in the non vegan experience    I think it s totally possible for vegans to get by on the sides and salads here  with the incredible sauces     because they are all so delicious  Just be prepared for a bit of a line and plan accordingly  Also BYOB   ,4,2018-11-02
Best sandwich I ve had in Pittsburgh by far  So we walked past this place today and the smell of woodfire BBQ stopped us in our tracks  It s a tiny spot and it was a bit of a wait but oh man was it worth  We got the pollo con pan  Pulled chicken sandwich it was phenomenal  Tasty chicken and potatoes The bread was amazing  Also must try the dipping sauces they have out  All of them were bursting with flavor  I also ordered the alfasmorez which was a twist on a s more nilla wafers marshmallow  chocolate  and ready for it  Dulce de leche   Caramel  sooooo heavenly   Must have a sweet tooth for this though   While waiting I saw a bunch if delicious things being served  I also realized we should have came earlier in the day because since everything seems to be in house made they run out later In the evening  First come  first serve  Everything looked and smelled great  Service was also friendly and funny  All in all a gem I never expected to find  Will be returning soon ,5,2014-02-23
Three stars because the line is stupid  Figure out the serving system  Is it McDonald s or is it a sit down restaurant    When you finally get into a seat   after waiting an ungodly amount of time  regardless of how long you perceived the line to be  it s always longer than you estimate    you feel guilty for staying and enjoying yourself for even a second because you have the thought of the other hangry patrons waiting in that stupid line    Buck up and be a regular restaurant  It makes no sense and doesn t cater to the regular person who enjoys your food tremendously but doesn t have the time to sit and wait for it  The food is good but is it worth that wait  Probs not more than once or twice ,3,2017-12-28
Stopped by Gaucho on a Saturday night date  It was a holiday weekend so the line was extra long  It took us  a party of two  about an hour and a half to get seated  When we were seated we realized there were tons of empty tables and that the congestion was at the ordering register rather than the lack of tables available    I ordered the carne sandwich with the lomo steak  The bread  peppers and onions on the sandwich were wonderful  I thought the steak was good but a lot of it was too charred for my taste    My husband got the chorizos   one spicy and one sweet  He really enjoyed it  He also got a pork empanada which was fresh and yummy  I tried a bit of his sweet chorizo  I am not a sausage person but the flavors were great    I definitely recommend ordering a side of tostada so you can dip the bread in the sauces  There were four sauces at the sauce bar   cebolla  chimmi  ajo and a red pepper sauce  My favorite was the ajo which was garlicky  My husband liked the chimmi sauce which was oily and cilantroy and also good ,3,2017-07-02
So after waiting so long to come to this wonderful establishment I am glad to say I finally made it   I ended up paying this place a visit over the weekend at around   pm when the lunch crowds had dissipated and the dinner crowd was yet to show up    Came here with hubby and the in laws when they were visiting from GA  Anyway I was initially overwhelmed by their menu but we started with the empanadas and fungos  mushrooms   For mains  my husband had the seafood soup and I had the Argentinian salad with filet    The empanadas were delicious  and were highly complimented by the various chimichurris they had  Chicken went really great with ajo  garlic sauce   and the beef went great with the regular chimichurri    My salad was excellent  it had greens  tomatos  mushrooms  onion  bell peppers  and some other stuff I dont remember along with a perfectly cooked filet  It was beautiful  it was tasty  and it was a great bang for your buck  I will have that again   As for hubbys soup  it had all sorts of sea monsters  clams  muscles  and calamari in a delicious broth which had a bit of a kick to it    Alll dishes had impeccable presentation  the whole establishment had an extremely clean feel and the wait staff was very helpful and attentive  I honestly could not ask more    I can t wait to go back ,5,2016-09-02
Gaucho is a great and offers some of the best menu items in Pittsburgh  We ordered the Paella and three empanadas  The Paella is sized for     people but reasonably for     people  Advice for the next time is to use the paella as a side dish  not a meal  The steak looks too good to resist and use the paella as a massive side dish ,5,2018-10-15
Cute location  Restaurant was clean and spacious   I ordered steak and empanadas  The steak was cooked well  Very tasty and nice side of salad that came with it  I ve tasted better empanadas  but no serious complaints ,4,2019-03-28
Food was amazing  great place within walking distance  definitely coming back  Also  Steve was a great guy  great energy and a positive attitude ,5,2019-09-12
In town from Los Angeles  where there have been some really excellent Argentinian restaurants over the years  in particular the Gaucho Grill    Stop the presses   The Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is the new champ  lucky those of you who live in Pittsburgh  or are visitors   I had the half Pollo  with the roasted potatoes  and the delicious selection of chimichurri  Mr  Atkinson  you have some competition    The prices were reasonable  the portions generous   Can t wait to return   ,5,2014-09-05
I have been converted   Praise El Gaucho ,5,2016-02-16
Ate here   days ago with   new friends  very busy   you have to order in the front desk and then wait to be seated  so there were a huge line waiting there  it took us about    mins to sit in front of table  Ordered Ribeye steak  Quiqui chicken  fried fish  seared shrimp  my ribeye steak was juicy and tasty  other dishes seems all fine too  Ps  The cookies at the front desk are quite nice,4,2019-04-06
The pulled pork and caramelized onions are incredible  Try all the sauces  So good  Would highly recommend,5,2019-06-26
Really long line to get in but that s part of the experience to some extent  Went there about a year ago exactly and still remember how good the quality of the food was,5,2018-10-14
Came here with my fraternity family this past spring  I forget what we were celebrating   Ended up with a whole bowl of paella and lots of appetizers  no complaints on anything  We had gone with a few bottles of wine but now there s a     corkage fee ,4,2019-11-03
I wish I could give this place        only downside is that the price is a little steep    However  the food is solidly delicious    Check out my pics for what we got this last time   If you can get past the line  it s got a pretty good vibe in there    Their meat is delicious   and they seem to run out if their signature flank steak occasionally because it s really so yummy    I also forget what healthy portions you get for sandwiches and we usually end up ordering a meat platter     This last time  I got a little daring and ordered their seafood mix soup   and it was really really good   The broth is rich and just full bodied    I could have just had the broth  but the seafood just brought this dish to a future always order category    Anyway   I ll be back ,5,2016-05-30
Yesterday was my  th time coming to this establishment       never fails to delight     unbelievable meat   Great atmosphere and friendly  outgoing staff   Only complaint would be the ordering process     it is always a bit tedious  especially when the folks in front of you are new and not familiar with the menu,4,2019-02-14
This place was phenomenal   I went with my friend and her mom and we all got different things and shared and everything was so delicious  Very filling without being too heavy  And I thought it was pretty reasonably priced  Definitely worth the wait   Can t wait to go back  ,5,2016-05-24
I love this place   I m shocked it took me so long to finally give this place a chance   Just walking by the smell tries to lure me in   Finally  we decided to go after being told we have to  I m so glad we did   They have some of the yummiest meat here    And I m a sucker for good steak   I have tried the NY Strip  Flank and Strip and have zero complaints  Everything we have had here has been great actually  papas bravas  provoletta  corn on the cob  etc     The only complaints are hours    Some days I just can t get here before  pm   Seating  in the winter  it will be tough unless they expand  that is unless you get it to go   I m sure that these are a possible change as they evolve   I can t wait to come back ,5,2014-07-07
My husband and I stopped by this gem on a Saturday evening around     pm or so  and boy am I glad we went when we did  When we went to go back in  we were seated outside  to grab some sauces  the line was wrapped around the building  Speaking of sauces  they all went well with the sandwiches we ordered  Sweet Sausage and the steak sandwich with flank  The sandwiches are a bit messy  but very delicious  We also tried the beef and pork empanadas  yum  I don t think anything on their menu would be a wrong decision ,5,2017-06-27
This is hands down  the best restaurant in Pittsburgh  I think about going there whenever I am hungry  The meat is unparalleled  the brussels sprouts are a favorite  but seriously  there is nothing they do not do well  I believe  My mouth is watering even writing this  Excellent  Loooong lines  so have a small snack if you need to wait  but stick it out  because it is so worth it ,5,2017-01-13
Such a long wait for bad service and an unnecessarily expensive meal  The waiters were eh,1,2018-07-03
I really don t understand why everyone is obsessed with this place  The food is good sure    but the line was an hour and a half when I went  Then you have to stand and wait for a table after you order  The chances are pretty good that you ll get your food before you get a table  People are just hovering over everyone to grab their tables when they look like they re ready to leave  The atmosphere is terrible   more like a Chipotle or Fazolis than a nice steak place  I give it   stars because the steak was tasty  but everything else was just average ,3,2015-12-19
Came for dinner around    pm on Thursday night and we were one of the first parties there before the big craze  It really fills up around  pm and the line gets backed up  Bf and I ordered the sampler plate and a cauliflower and avocado salad and   steak empanadas  Our bill was around     and the food was pretty delicious  The sauce options were great but you couldn t really taste one from the other   ,5,2016-01-15
I have never left Gaucho hungry or disappointed   Wood fired meats and munchies  all world class  It was one of the few places we could eat out while doing Whole   and it was well worth the effort  I ve had much of the menu and absolutely nothing here will let you down    The Empanadas here are phenomenal  Generous portions and so  so flavorful   The El Gaucho salad is a delight  as it adds roasted Beets and Avocado to the already excellent La Casa salad  Get it with the Braised Beef and do a tiny happy dance while you eat it   Speaking of Beef  meats   They are most well known for their meats here and they deliver every time  Get that Asado Platter and share it with someone you love  Nothing brings people together like   cuts of steak   One last thing  Sauces  GET  THEM  ALL ,5,2018-12-07
Unlike Yelp  this place is amazing  Order a thing from the menu  eat it and be happy ,5,2016-08-22
Rosemary Briased Beef and ALL THE SAUCES   Gaucho has quickly and easily become one of my all time favorite restaurants in the area  If you catch it at the right time  there is no wait  If you go when it s busy be prepared to wait  but it s always so worth it  This is a great place for date night  family night  girls night out and lunch  Still haven t tried the Brussels sprouts but hope to on one of my many return trips ,5,2018-09-13
Pretty good food  And the price is fair  But the wait is so weird  It took us an hour to move about   feet   from just outside the door to the counter  And there was almost no one sitting ,3,2018-12-20
Just do it   Come for a great meal great service great fun   What an adventure of flavors   What an amazing menu   It is truly a wonderful experience   I look forward to my next meal here   Thank you Gaucho team this was a great food taste explosion ,5,2018-12-29
We were recommended Gaucho by some friends and were not dissapointed  the food is delicious   I had the sirloin and my gf had the pollo mmm mmm  The ordering is a little strange and it took us a bit to figure out what we wanted but it did not disappoint ,5,2016-08-16
Show up early  bring beer and be prepared to wait  Crazy packed on Saturdays but oh so worth it ,5,2019-06-29
This place is AWESOME   If you love steak and are human  you have to make a stop at Gaucho Parrilla Argentina  Everything looked and sounded so good  so we ordered a little bit of everything  We ordered the Asado Platter which comes with all the varieties of steak that they offer  the Rusted Roots  the Chikki Empanadas and the Papas al Hornos  I wish I lived in Pittsburgh so that I can go here once a week  okay maybe everyday   TIP   they don t serve beer wine but they allow you to bring your own   ,5,2018-01-30
A great twist to Argentina food  Grilled to perfection a very relaxed atmosphere and easy to share plates  You get to choose the best meal for you ,5,2018-07-21
I welcome meat coma wholeheartedly when I dine at Gaucho   Their sauces are phenomenon   Chimmi and Ajo are my favorite    I probably spent     of my dinner time contemplating about how to take some sauce home   So standard procedure   you can always expect a long line at Gaucho  except when it is raining on a random week night   We waited about    minutes at      PM on a rainy week day   Here s how the line works   The line is for ordering food   You are only allowed to order if they have a table for you   For easy sharing  my party opted for no sandwich   For starters  we got the chicky and beefy empanadas   They are two bites and done empanadas  so if you love empanadas then be selfish and get your own   Knowing all the meat we were about to consume  we ordered the only non salad vegetable on the menu   the mushrooms  They were glazed with sauce and soft to the bite   For the main courses  we ordered the lamp chop  ribeye  and NY strip  All small at   oz    We ordered the meat at medium rare but the steak all came out a little over medium   However  the sauces made all these problems go away   The lamp chop was medium rare and it was not gamey  thumbs up   I would love to come back and try the flank  but we had a pretty amazing spread   The special of the day was sopa de mariscos   tomato based soup with assorted seafood  clams  shrimp  mussels    It s a great broth to dip your bread   Oh  and this place is BYOB   Apparently many restaurants are    guess we are still learning about Pittsburgh as we go ,5,2017-05-01
The food here is amazing  Really nice dipping sauces for your sandwiches ,5,2015-12-31
  star rating  Well worth it  They are currently expanding to larger location incorporating the next door location  Tried the Bondiola and Ribeye steak sandwich  For apps we did steak empanadas with papas cuna  Came out excellent  Service was phenomenal  Well worth it and will come back next time I m in town ,5,2015-06-19
Just got to town for a convention and absolutely starving so decided to look for yelp restaurant recommendations in close proximity to my hotel in downtown Pittsburgh  There was a jimmy johns and seven eleven across the street but after a harrowing   hour drive from DC I needed to reward myself with something amazing    This restaurant was a little over half a mile from my hotel but I didn t care  Made the   block trek in record time and let s just say my stomach thanked me  I had the ribeye steak plate with a salad and the salad was a beautiful concoction of mixed greens with shaved carrots  baby tomatoes and radishes wonderfully dressed with a balsamic dressing and sprinkled with fresh black pepper  This place carries four house sauces  A chimnichurriesque one  a garlic  a Smokey one and one made of onions  All great accompaniments to the steak and salad  I actually drank some of the sauce from the little plastic cup because it was so good  I ordered the broccolini as an additional side and it came with a beautiful char off the grill  I drenched it in the garlic sauce and that just elevated the flavor although it was already divine  My favorite sauce was the garlic sauce but who doesn t love garlic but the others might appeal to others    While the food was pretty awesome the wait staff were also very attentive  While you re ordering someone gets your table prepped and walks you to it  This same individual also brings you a sampler of the four sauces which I think is a nice touch    This place only serves coke products but is byob with and no uncorking fee for those who need some wine with their steak  The table next to me appeared to be having a wine tasting party with their meal ,5,2018-03-21
Real good place for red meat eaters   Variety of steak   lamb and pork collection  Quick service and nice ambience Seemed A little pricey for its small scale place though  Make sure you choose a non peak hour to visit if you dont like standing in long lines  This was my third attempt here and i finally made it  ,4,2019-11-04
I loved the food here  Great taste and good variety in food  I only wish that the portions were bigger ,4,2018-01-07
Allow me to chime in with the chorus of praise for Gaucho  My wife and I came here a few nights back  We enjoyed the flank steak  inexplicably cheaper than skirt  though the flank is higher quality in my opinion  and grilled vegetables  Clean plates  not a straggler left  The guys running the joint had great personality and a friend customer   had brought in some homebrew to share with the crowd  I would have given them five stars without the free beer  but it sure as hell doesn t hurt  Highly recommended ,5,2014-08-24
Gaucho Parrilla is more hip then Argentinian   Every second I knew I was in the Strip district and not in Argentina   No Argentinian drinks but BOB  The food was prepared with care   spices complimented each type of   meat platter  Servers are energetic but nobody really checks on you when you get it   The line is long and it creates false sense of amazing things to come  Sausage was a bit too spicy but maybe that is a standard because I do not know anything about Argentinian spices  The crowd s estimated age average was      I was at the high end of age scale   I did it   I do not regret it it was very good ,4,2017-04-16
Super fresh and inventive food that is worth the wait   Love love love     the salads   fav is the Argentina with grilled fish   The grilled vegetables are sooooo good it makes eating veggies divine   Empanadas with vegetables were super good too  We want to get a nice group together to try the Paella pan   hopefully soon because this place is addictive ,4,2016-03-06
traveled to Pittsburgh with my bf who had a business trip to the city   Came in around  pm on a Tuesday afternoon for a late lunch   I ordered a  porky  empanada  small rib eye with chimmichurri  sub salad with oven roasted red skin potatoes   and the campfire yams  It was all so good  Loved the taste of the char on the outer edges of the meat which was tender and flavorful  the potatoes were awesome  slightly crunchy on outside  buttery and soft on the inside the way a good baked potato should be  the empanada was fantastic  nice and tender pastry  flavorful filling  the yams were good my only critique would be that they could ve used some butter  All these things were great on their own  but what sent it over the top was the selection of sauces that you can add on   my personal favorite was the pimenton  red pepper sauce   OMG  I could put this on anything and everything   It was sooooo good  Lastly  the staff  I interacted with about   different people while I was there  were all super helpful and friendly  they made the restaurant a warm and inviting place to be  I don t know when I ll be in Pittsburgh again  but I sure hope to make another trip back here when I do ,5,2018-12-16
I truly don t even know if this review needs to be written as it s obviously no secret that Gaucho is amazing  but I ll put my two cents in as well    I always get either the small Bife de Gaucho or the steak sandwich with filet  They are cooked SO beautifully each time I order them  My favorite sauce is the onion y one that I can t seem to remember the name of  Of course  if their corn on the cob is an option  you definitely need to have that in your life    Their BYO policy is wonderful and I really like the new system of how they seat you vs  letting you seat yourself   I also recently had the pleasure of having their Asado truck at a friend s event  and the quality of the food was just as on point  They are killing the game right now  ,5,2016-10-23
I ve been here twice  gotten the flank steak sandwich both times  The first experience was honestly life changing and I probably hyped the memory too much for the second go around  the steak was a little chewier the latter time  Still  such a simple concept but the flavors are amazing  Their grilled veggies are solid for friends who don t eat meat but their admittedly won t be much else for them ,5,2017-05-12
My favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh  The food is fresh and well seasoned and or marinated  without the typical overwhelming acidity or oiliness  The salads are everything  full of a variety of fresh veggies and subtlety dressed  The add on s provide the most satisfying meal  My husband tries different items almost every time  We have never been disappointed ,5,2018-11-17
 sigh  I really wanted to love this place   Really   The food is decent  The beef empanadas were really good  That sauce that s so talked about  chimi  is worthy of taking a bottle home for dipping on garlic bread and putting it on just about everything   But that s where the good time stopped for us   I m not one to put down a place just because the wait time is crazy long as long as the wait is worth it   but this just didn t ever feel worth it to us   The restaurant was so loud I could barely speak to my boyfriend  Everyone is kinda crammed together but there s no real  friendly  atmosphere here  It s very disjointed and chaotic  We got there on what seemed like a rather  slow  night and still waited a good hour to order and sit  Like I said  the food was just MEH    those beef empanandas I would have totally taken    of those home with me and been content  though   with the chimi sauce    I had the pork  boyfriend had the steak burger  The bread was burnt to almost unrecognizable consistency and I ve honestly had pork just as good  if not better in other places  If I were you  I d skip the hype  stop waiting outside for hours in all kinds of weather  and go find another of the million great places to eat in Pittsburgh ,2,2017-11-06
Still by far the best steak in Pittsburgh  If you leave here hungry it is your own fault ,5,2018-10-20
We flew into Pittsburgh as part of multi cities driving trip  We only have one day here before we had to go to the next city  We thought the best way to know the city is to  yes     go on the double decker city bus tour    The tour guide bus took us to one of many neighborhood in Pittsburgh  including the street that Gaucho was on  It was around lunch time and the line to Gaucho was noticeably long  The wonderful smell of grilled meat emanated from Gaucho s building  My son and I decided to check it out for lunch   By the time we finished our city tour  made it back to Gaucho  it was almost   pm  There was still a line  albeit shorter  to wait for a seat  The wait was absolutely worth it   We ordered a salad and   empanadas  All were good  And we were absolutely stuffed  Our favorite were the beef empanadas    Had we live in the area  I d want to come back here often to try out other items in their menu ,5,2019-08-03
Great place and excellent food  Quality of the meat is top notch and the side dishes are awesome  No wonder its so busy all the time   I will go back again very soon ,5,2018-11-26
      medium rare                           ,4,2016-10-19
Wonderful  I had the chimi steak and potatoes and they were delicious  For desert white chocolate blueberry bread pudding   Wow this place is doing it right ,5,2019-09-23
Gaucho is my far one is my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh  We obviously had to wait in line but it is worth the wait  The portion size of the sandwich is perfect  the service is prompt  and it s nice that you pay up front so you don t have to wait around for a check  The food is so incredibly flavorful and the sauces are to die for ,5,2019-02-02
Be advised  Changes to their BYOB policy  Wine is only BYOB option and at     per bottle  What s warrants that  I don t know  Check their website for details   Surprisingly on a Halloween night with rain pouring down  no one in line to order at the register  AND they weren t slowing down the order taking so that the kitchen could fill orders for takeout and their downstairs Bodega seating as was the case the last couple visits    As always excellent food across the board for everything the four in our party ordered ,5,2019-11-01
Hands up  for a high five  favorite place for food in Pittsburgh  Casual and fun  but most importantly DELICIOUS every time    Meat is always cooked perfectly  and the vegetables and sides are rich and filling  The variety of self serve sauces are a nice bonus to eat with anything and everything   Environment inside is cozy and welcoming and extends to the back for extra seating  Small patio is also nice in good weather  BYOB    don t forget your wines and beers ,5,2018-04-28
Lucked at and didn t have to wait long for the deliciousness that is Gaucho  I had my usual small flank steak  It s served with carmelized onions  delicious   salad and a piece of toast  The small is plenty for a meal    My husband had the condero  which is smoked leg of lamb  He thought it was going to be lamb served how the steak is served  but it was actually more like a stew  Nonetheless  he seemed to enjoy it  Also served with a salad and a side  The side was a marinated eggplant salad served cold  I enjoyed it   We also ordered two empanadas  one beef and one pork  The empanadas rotate regularly  They re small  but good  And the filling to dough ratio is near perfect  a little heavier on the dough     Also love the selection of help yourself salsas and chimmis to accompany your meal  My go tos are the garlic sauce and the chimmi    I m always impressed at how they manage the customer to table ratio  Maybe I ve just been there at the right time  but we ve never had a probably getting a table  after waiting to order our food  of course  and we ve never felt rushed ,5,2019-01-12
Gaucho is the quintessential Pittsburgh restaurant  They have a personable and excellent staff who are always friendly and welcoming  Their atmosphere is that of a rustic yet modern cabin  and their food is the zenith of the experience  The wood fired meats and vegetables are the perfect texture  and the restaurant has four options for sauces to pour on top of them  The delicious sauces suffuse impeccably with the meats and the vegetables  creating a harmony of flavors   The desserts are superb as well  Do I need to say anything about a mango coconut bread pudding to convince you   The only issue with Gaucho is the line  They re so good that too many people go there  Get there early  so you don t get caught in the line    They re an invaluable asset to Pittsburgh s food scene ,5,2019-06-15
I moved to Pittsburgh   months ago   my boyfriend   I have gone here   times already  This place is incredible  Their steak   bread are heavenly  I recommend the steak burger to anyone  I ve also had their basic salad   even that is incredible  The downside is the wait but honestly it is well worth it for the food  Plus it is BYOB  wine with dinner makes it even better  ,5,2019-10-09
Long line up but moves quick  Amazing steak  first time for us to try chorizo empanadas  Bread pudding is great as well  Nice location  just next to a bridge and river ,5,2019-05-02
Delicious as always   Meat cooked perfectly with the wood fire flavor   We did take out since the sign said there was an A C issue   Anyway take out was great so we could eat outside today in the wonderful Sunny weather   We took a few of the four sauces to share   Have been to Gaucho many times and finally tried a Chicky Empanada   The Empanada was very good but my Carne Sandwich was absolutely delicious   While we did not have any of the small plates or sides they are usually very good with the wood fired flavor ,5,2019-09-25
In my opinion  this is good food  but not worth the insane wait times  Most frustrating about those long lines is that  a  in Pittsburgh there is about a     chance it s raining at any given moment  so chances are you are standing in line in the rain  and  b  there is really no discernible reason the line is THAT long except that the kitchen is just sort of slow   All that said  the steak is really tasty  and very affordable for the quality  Potatoes make a great side  and the sauce  chimichurri in particular  go great with everything else ,4,2019-01-10
Surprise  surprise     another five star review   It s worthy of the hype  Go here  immediately  And bring a growler of your favorite beer or a bottle of wine    We ordered the steak sandwich  filet cut  with the grilled corn  along with the rib eye platter  Both were cooked and flavored perfectly  Which is a  shame   because their sauces are out of this world  still managed to use them to dip the bread   Speaking of the bread    it s wonderful  A perfectly baked ciabatta  crispy on the outside  soft on the inside    The staff was extremely friendly  and clearly loved their jobs  The manager walked around and asked everyone how their meals and experiences were  and was quite friendly    Can I go back now ,5,2014-06-23
After a busy day in Pittsburgh  nothing beats a great dinner with good food  Even though it was raining  we walked a few blocks to this place  A block away we saw a line winding out from a corner  No mistake  it was Gaucho Parrilla  Standing in the rain  I saw in the faces of the crowd resolution and passion for the upcoming dinner   No sooner than one hour  we finally made our order and got sit down at a table  Waiting staff were very friendly  We brought a bottle of wine  and a server promptly asked how many wine glasses we need  Everything was ready  dinner was served   Wife s Carne burger made with grilled ribeye  was truly great  She also had steak and chicken empanadas  Seeing my jealous look  she cut a small piece to share  It was good indeed  My parillada mixta was also terrific  with medium rare pink colored strip steak  blacken chicken and sausage  made a meat lover happy  I had to reluctantly share some with my wife in exchange for her generosity sharing the carne and empanadas    Great food  reasonable price  byob no cork charge and with wine glass from the house  servers came a few times asking if need any help  Except the noise in the hall made by all the excited dinners and people waiting in line  this is a perfect dining experience for us  Five star and will be back if we are in Pittsburgh ,5,2017-08-06
Can t think of how the steak could be better and trust me  we tried all of them  Went to capital grill during the same trip and wished we had returned  to this strip neighbourhood meatetarian  heaven  Waiting on the long like to get in is uncivilised and worth it ,5,2019-03-24
One of my favorite places  I ve never had something I didn t love  My go to is the arrachera  I ve waited in line    minutes before and still thought it was worth it    Line tip   try early on a week day  Or call ahead and get take out ,5,2019-05-20
Gaucho was AMAZING  This was my second visit  and both times have been incredible  The first time  I got the steak sandwich  the meat was cooked perfectly and the bread is perfectly crusty yet soft on the inside  Tonight I got the fish sandwich  and I can honestly say it was the best sandwich I have ever had  The fish of the day  I believe it was walleye  was flaky and seasoned nicely  and went perfectly with all the flavorful sauces  Also  the potatoes are delicious as well  YUM ,5,2016-01-20
This is one of the best places I have been to in Pittsburgh   Food  We spent only    dollars for   females  And it was really really delicious  The rib eye steak was juicy  It is a  must order dish   Qui Qui chicky was tender  Don t forget to squeeze some lemon juice on the meat  And the provoletta is also recommended  It tasted a little salty at first and then a milky taste would fill your mouth  We also had empanadas and steak burger  One of the empanada flavor was great  but I cannot remember it was beefy or vegi        The steak burger was not as juicy as it was described in other comments  maybe it was because we were busy eating other food and did not eat the burger until it was cold    Environment  It is small  Go there early  Better at     Otherwise  you will need to wait a long time   Service  The waiters are prompt  There is no assigned waiter  So everyone passed by would help you if you need help ,5,2017-08-18
This restaurant is definitely a gem  The food is great and compared to other Argentine steakhouses  it is very affordable  However the line is very long  usually more than an hour on weekends so I recommend visiting only on weekdays  even then there might be a    minute line ,5,2018-12-03
We stopped in mid afternoon  and the line was several people long  but the wait wasn t too long  But it was certainly worth it  We could smell the grill as we were waiting  and the menu  had so many choices  We got grilled cauliflower and grilled broccolini  both amazing  and the vegetable empanadas  along with the provolone fried cheese and toast  which came with arugula and olive salad  which may have been the favorite thing  Everything was very flavorful without being too spicy  even the homemade sauces  which added just the right touch  Parking can be a little tricky  but don t let that keep you from trying it  We also enjoyed that it was a diverse crowd  we  two sisters and a daughter  sat between a table of young ethnic  business women sharing a huge pan of paella and a table of men in white shirts and ties  kicking back with some BYO ale and chatting about sports  Highly recommend  ,5,2019-10-27
We waited two hours here but every minute was SO WORTH IT  We ordered a tonnnn of food  We got the pork and vegetarian empanadas  chicken sandwich  potatoes  SO GOOD    Qui Qui chicken  Proveletta  grilled provolone cheese   and the Cordero  braised leg of lamb   After all that food  we got flan for dessert  which was also really good  Gaucho is one of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh,5,2019-02-21
I really love this place  The trick is to go there at      in the middle of the week  The meats are done to perfection  The daily empanadas are always great  There s a plethora of meat to choose from but if you feel overwhelmed  which I did  the staff is more than willing to help you  I also enjoy the corn and cauliflower  they have a nice char to them  It s worth the wait and it s byob ,5,2019-03-07
Food very good   The wait outside made no sense as I saw   empty tables       counter side seats not in use  Then the weird dieting process  First we had party of       you wait at counter and order individually  then get back in line to pay separately   Weird And inefficient  Meats ordered medium came to table looking medium to Well    got even more well done as stilling cooking on platter    chef should realize that meat still cooks after serving  Overall food was great    next time I order rare or medium rare All sauces excellent  broccolini side just ok    lacked garlic   The chirozios sausage sweet and spicy was worth trip with roasted peppers  onions  BYOB I liked but doing away with at bd of October  The Phan dessert was excellent and website doesn t even show desserts  More grilled fish options   I ll be back and order meat medium rare and raise my stars to     ,3,2019-10-24
Did you ever go to a spot that you were rooting for and loved the food and once it stated to expand  you had hoped other elements of the dining experience would be just as incredible   I ve been a long time fan of Gaucho and was one of its first customers    The food still is quite amazing but there are some things I would certainly change   They don t take reservations  which is fine  but you wait in a line that wraps around outside and freeze as you wait  They should really invest in some heat lamps to accommodate their customers if they expect people to keep coming through winter    The host is a bit rigid and not the best with service  For instance  if you ve got several people in line outside freezing their tushes off  maybe he could offer to bring drinks to the customers waiting outside  I don t even expect it to be free  some level of effort would be nice to make it an enjoyable experience if you are expected to wait    The area where there is seating is cute but it could be much more ambient in terms of dim lighting  noise level  perhaps introduce some music   etc    I ll be curious to see how gaucho continues to evolve as I really do like it ,3,2019-11-16
It s a very hot summer afternoon  We walked into the place which had a nice crowd  We discussed a few minutes before ordering   The order system is order at counter then they ca your name then delivery to your table   We ordered pork and steak small dinner which was   oz of meat and it s plenty   We also ordered potatoes  corn and empanadas as appetizers  We tried all   sources and all every wonderful  Highly recommend this place for a causal place  I do a complaint was the music might be too loud  The table was pretty big so we couldn t hear our conversation too well  Other then that food was excellent   I do love the pickled onion in the salad and the real caramelized onions on the side with the pork ,4,2015-08-16
Definitely a new favorite  The Ribeye was cooked perfectly  the fire roasted peppers and onions were delicious  all on Ciabatta bread  which is my favorite  The small plate potatoes were perfection  They have four dipping sauces that are all fire roasted and delicious  The fire roasted corn in the husk was sweet and delicious    When they say their food is cooked with love  that is exactly what it is  I will frequent Gaucho often    ,5,2014-04-27
This place has great food  friendly staff and lives up to the reviews I ve seen all over the country     My only complaints  not really complaints  are that it is always so packed and the wait is forever  but that is expected in a place that has such great and unique food in this area   The other is that they don t serve alcohol  which is not a huge drawback but if they did  then no one would EVER leave   And the lines would only grow longer   PLEASE open another one in the South Hills      Try this place   you will not be disappointed   Something for everyone ,5,2016-03-04
OUTSTANDING  This trendy little place lived up to the hype and was the highlight of my trip to Pittsburgh    For        you ll enjoy a prime cut of phenomenal steak  served with a deliciously simple salad and bread  Our first bites had my buddy and I shaking our heads in disbelief  Soooo good  The chimchurri sauces    different kinds  are simple  fresh and wonderful  these are a MUST to get the full spectrum of flavor   Brand wise  these guys are doing everything right  They ve shown a lot of attention to detail  from the sleek wooden plates to the chalkboard walls and hand stamped take out bags    My favorite part  however  was the staff  They were COOL AS       We came in on off peak hours and pretty much the whole kitchen greeted us  The manager was obviously as passionate about food as he is about the restaurant  He energetically talked us through the whole menu and spent a good    minutes giving us the scoop on other great restaurants when we asked for local recommendations    Seriously loved Gaucho s ,5,2014-10-26
We spent the day at the Heinz History Center and about halfway through the museum realized we wanted to eat something more than what the museum cafe had to offer  We yelped and found this restaurant  The place smelled  of smoked goodness when we walked in the door   I ordered two empanadas   one veggie and one beef and the rosemary braised beef sandwich  Side note  they also have canning jars of various sauce accompaniments which I highly recommend getting one of each to taste  they re great to dip the bread in and to spoon on the empanadas  The meat is very flavorful and I loved the bread  So yummy  And again  the sauces were a nice flavor addition  My eyes were bigger than my stomach  I still had half a sandwich left for later  The meat portion in the sandwich is huge    My husband has the Bife de gaucho   ribeye  He loved it  Beef  roast  that he dipped in the sauces  and a nice salad  He ordered the large and it was more than enough  We left stuffed and ready to walk back to the Heinz center to see the other half of what is an awesome museum ,5,2019-12-08
Always great food and a wonderful atmosphere  I have never had a bad meal here  Every steak is excellent and cooked to perfection  When in season  I highly recommend the roasted corn on the cob  You are always treated as family here ,5,2019-08-01
I cannot believe I had not updated my review  This is hands down one of Pittsburgh s top three restaurants and they earned it  They started in a space the size of their current kitchen  and this was actually the building  and they have since blossomed into a consistent  creative  fun  high end  but not stuffy headed steak house Argentinian style    Everything from the salads with meat added option  which is an excellent value for prime cuts  the side dishes  empanadas  sandwiches  and steak plates are fun  rustic  a touch playful  always delicious  and  simply put  exciting and satisfying eats  I don t really need to break it down because you can find something for everyone here and it will be good  Don t discount how good they can do fish or chicken because they can do it very well   For those that have not been  this is a counter service style restaurant so you cannot save tables or be seated until you have ordered  As part of the success  expect long lines during prime hours particularly power lunches and Friday   weekend dinner  Calling ahead is not always reliable to get your order in but is an option for pickups  The line for the counter can go up to an hour and a half long and on some nights the doors are closed almost two hours before closing time if they are at capacity with a very long line waiting  You will know because end of line will have a wood sign stating they are the last to be admitted    Don t fret though  it is worth coming back another day because what you ll get is worth the wait and the price    and they are still very fair about all of their prices for what is superior quality and you would be charged almost double in a traditional steakhouse ,5,2019-03-17
So unbelievably good   I had been to their previous location and loved the food  but the space was beyond small making getting your food to go the only viable option    I was super excited to return once I learned that they had moved a couple doors down into a much larger space with two floors worth of seating  but every time I tried to get there the line to get in was literally around the block  The day we went there was actually no wait so we hurried up and parked and made a beeline to the door   Once inside I was not only blown away by how much nicer the new space was  but by how much was added to the menu since we visited the original location  After about    minutes of staring at the menu board we were ready to order   I chose a Carne ribeye steak sandwich which features your choice of steak with chimmichurri sauce  grilled peppers and caramelized onions  My steak was cooked perfectly  The steak was tender  very juicy and full of flavor  My wife chose the Pollo sandwich which features grilled chicken  pickled red onions  portobello mushrooms and ajo sauce  She absolutely loved it  Our daughter chose the steak burger which features a half pound burger  chimmichurri sauce and your choice of two topping  She added bacon and blue cheese  She loved her burger as well   One thing that I have always loved about Gaucho is that they have always cooked whatever meat I have order just as I ask  It is so hard to get perfectly cooked meat now a days  unfortunately  Service was quick and very attentive  I also like the fact that there is an exit door on the second floor that makes it easy to avoid the line of waiting people downstairs when you are ready to leave   Be sure to try each of their four sauces  Chimmichurri  Argentine Steak Sauce  which has fresh parsley and oregano  garlic  pepper flakes  red wine vinegar and olive oil  Ajo which has roasted garlic cloves with caramelized onions  parsley and pepper with olive oil  Pimenton which has grilled red bell peppers  fresh garlic  parsley  vinegar and olive oil  And Cebolla which has caramelized onion  vinegar  olive oil and parsley  Each sauce is very unique and different and all worth trying ,5,2018-05-14
By far the best steak sandwich in the city  toppings are on point and they never fail to cook it to perfection  I could eat here every day ,5,2015-11-05
I am not one for hyperbole   But damn  Gaucho Parrilla prepared one of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life   Please do yourself a favor and check this place out   The food was spectacular   I had the Steak Burger and an empanada   The empanada was just OK in my opinion   I have never been one for Argentine style empanadas so this is probably just bias  still the sandwich was so good I had to give this place   stars    I went with a couple of co workers and we all kind of sat around in contemplative silence when we finished  brains working hard to recall a better sandwich    We all had different sandwiches but left with the same feeling  so I would say feel free to try any  these guys take real pride in what they prepare   I look forward to going back there today and check out another item on the menu before leaving Pitt ,5,2014-08-07
This place is tasty and unique  It is one my favorite places that I like to go to during their not so busy times  I eat out a lot so I m not accustom to waiting in long lines   People love this place so at popular lunch and dinner times there will be a line out the door and around the corner   I get it though     ,5,2019-03-27
My boyfriend and I both really liked Gaucho  He got the Carne sandwich and   piece of sweet steak and I got the beans and greens and Provoletta  We were both pleased with the amount of food and LOVED the AJO GARLIC sauce  yum  Would go back because the prices are fair  BYOB is a plus and it s different from our typical cuisine ,5,2018-11-30
No words   Haven t been back since they expanded  but the food is out of this world  The chimichurri sauces are unique  as is the concept   Treat yourself ,5,2015-11-23
Loved this place  BYOB  including boxed wine    I don t believe there was even a corking fee  The fish of the day sounded too out there for me so I stuck with the shrimp  Date had the pork chops and they were spicy  But delicious  Will be back soon ,5,2015-11-11
As everyone here has already mentioned  Gaucho is amazing  The wait outside moves fairly quickly and is completely worth every second  Once inside  the atmosphere is fantastic   the staff does a wonderful job of keeping it relaxed  hipster ish  and low key  They answered all of our questions and eased us into the entire experience  And so suave   I love that they provide seating but allow the customer to grab their own place settings  glasses and sauces  No cork fee  And the sauces are all delicious  and not spicy     The music is amazing too  like old school  early     s hip hop   Waiting for our food  all we could do was stare at everyone else s dinners with longing eyes  Totally acceptable behavior at Gaucho  btw  I did the Rosemary braised sandwich and it was magnificent  And we split three empanadas  Next time  and there will definitely be a next time  I m definitely going for the grilled corn and an open faced cut that includes a tostado and a side salad  Because I almost attacked my friend s plate for it  The veggies will help break up all the meat and bread   I don t really have to mention it  but everyone needs to stop by  You absolutely won t regret it  Five stars ,5,2016-04-08
This place was pretty good  and I totally understand why there are so many positive reviews of this restaurant  The potatoes were super amazing and the sauces added a lot of great flavor  The chicken empanada was awesome  but the beef was only so so   My sister and I were not huge fans of the sandwiches  They had a ton of meat  and we both took a lot of it off our sandwiches  I had the Bandiola  pork shoulder  and my sister had the Carne  steak  sandwich  I thought that the flavors of my sandwich were really interesting  but so intense I could only eat about     of the sandwich  Ditto for my sister   We also got     dozen cookies they had in a display case for the road    hour trip   Those were AMAZING  So  so  good  I think those change day to day  but give their dessert a try ,4,2015-11-15
Don t let the line here psych you out   this place is well worth the wait  Plus waiting       minutes for some of the best food in the city shouldn t be much of a deal breaker   Gaucho has a casual counter service set up at the front to place your order  But immediately after you order and pay  you are seated at your own table and its just like any other sit down experience      A friend and I split the special charcuterie board and the Parillada Mixta so we could try the steak  chorizo and chicken  Everything was incredibly flavorful but the steak was  no doubt  the star of the meal  I m also a big fan of sauce  and Gaucho gives you a selection of   homemade dipping sauces     Don t forget its BYO,5,2019-10-07
My absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh  Great wood fired food  BYOB  and decent prices ,5,2017-09-24
I like the wings a lot  perhaps the best wings in the city   I ve also heard amazing things about the burger  but you can t really go wrong ,5,2016-06-22
I m always in the mood for Gaucho  I just moved to the Pittsburgh area  and this is the first place that my girlfriend took me as a welcome to the city meal  I couldn t have been happier    I got the carne sandwich  Amazing steak  The bread doesn t get waterlogged and the paper wrapping doesn t make a mess like it looks like it might    The sauces are incredible  but the sandwiches don t need them    This is the go to place for a treat yourself meal for me  Now that I m in the area  I expect I ll see Gaucho a lot more ,5,2019-08-08
The food was awesome  The environment and atmosphere was very hipster ish  The service people were kind and helpful  Not too expensive either  Would go again ,4,2019-01-14
Exceptional food   Waited in line outside in freezing weather and don t regret it for one minute ,5,2019-02-25
I ve been here a while ago and just writing a review  Definitely come early in the morning  every other time it is packed   Line stretches a block down  Delicious food  Nice portions  Definitely come with friends and have a great time ,5,2017-12-02
Just  yes  I took my   years old  there was nothing left on his plate  Great salad  sauce and everything else was a delight  So so fun   delicious  Glad to have tried it   worth going on a splurge or spending less  You ll be happy ,5,2018-10-13
After reading all the reviews I can say that the hype about Gaucho is true   The meat is absolutely fantastic   My husband and I split a skirt steak   The only thing is a bit weird is how you order at a counter and sit down for your meal   It is quite pricey for this kind of set up  however given the quality of the food I can let this little detail aside   Make sure you try all of their sauces  absolutely fantastic   I can t wait to come back and try other things ,5,2017-08-25
Can t beat this spot  My favorite in Pittsburgh  Food is phenomenal  Staff is quite nice  Today  I got the Bon Mi  It was stellar    I suggest arriving    mins before they open the doors to avoid the rush ,5,2016-06-07
Quite simply  the meal was off the charts  Couple that with a modern seating area and fair pricing so if I could give a score higher than   stars I would   Just be aware  the ordering process is when you walk in NOT at the table   So I would recommend reviewing the menu via their website before visiting ,5,2018-08-02
I had    hours in Pittsburgh and this is the place that my dad and I really wanted to try   Many Yelp reviews mention the option to call in an order to take out so I was going to try that as our flight arrived after  pm on a Saturday night and I wasn t sure if we would make it by the time we drove down there and had to wait in line   However  when I called the restaurant to place my order literally as soon as I got into my rental car  the person who picked up the phone said that THEY DO NOT DO TAKE OUT ORDERS ON SATURDAY NIGHTS as they don t want to cut the people waiting in line   I guess I can understand that logic  but I haven t seen a Yelp review that mentioned this and there are no mentions of it on their website either   I was definitely bummed  as I explained that I was visiting from CA and when he said that I should visit again on another day  I told him that I would be out of town by the time they opened again  they are closed on Sun Mon    I m sure the food here is amazing  but just had to let the Yelp world know that at least on Saturdays they better plan their schedule to wait in line instead of hoping for take out as you won t have that option ,1,2018-10-01
By far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh right now  Such a cool experience and the food is AMAZING  Definitely recommend to do with friends or date night  it s so unique  Bonus it s BYOB  Can t wait to go back  ,5,2018-07-03
The line is usually out the door  but it s worth the wait  The food here is amazing  You can t go wrong whether you get a steak or a sandwich  The quality of the desserts is a pleasant surprise  And the prices are reasonable  especially considering the location and the food quality  Don t get scared away by the line and you ll have one of the best meals Pittaburgh has to offer  Gaucho apparently opened a food truck as well  so keep an eye out around town for your Gaucho fix ,5,2018-04-25
This place is ridiculous  Visiting Pittsburgh for a day and saw how highly rated it was  so wanted to try for lunch  OH MAN  What a good decision  The food is SO GOOD  We got a flank steak plate and a tilapia  the fish of the day  plate  Both were presented beautifully and were above and beyond our expectations  The four sauce accompaniments that are available are incredible  and I took a special liking to the ajo   We came during off hours on a Tuesday  so there was no wait at all for a table which we were very happy about  having heard people warn of long wait times  The entire meal for the two of us was      which is beyond reasonable for the quantity of the food  For the quality they provide      for those two plates is cheeeeeap   I wish this place were in NYC   I m trying to convince my boyfriend we should go back for lunch before we leave tomorrow   ,5,2016-05-03
My boyfriend played tour guide for the weekend since he went to college at CMU and knew the area better than me  When I suggested this place for dinner  he said   No way  Yinzers don t eat that   Well he was very wrong and we decided to come here at the advice of our Uber driver  We had the Asado Platter  grits  eggplant  beef and chicken empanadas  This was way too much food for two people but we had to try everything since we had limited time in Pittsburgh  The meat was perfectly charred and done medium rare  per request  and the Asado Platter is a great way for trying all the cuts  I wish more steak houses had this option  The grits and eggplant sides were mediocre but necessary to balance out our very carnivorous meal  I felt the same way about the empanadas  there was a little too much breading for the amount of filling  In the end  my boyfriend also had to admit that this place was pretty great and that Pittsburgh has come a long way since his college days of fried mac and cheese bites  towering sandwiches  and spicy wings    Tip  Dip everything in their   sauces and come early or be prepared to wait  We came    minutes before opening on Saturday and there was already a line of     outside the door ,5,2019-01-03
I absolutely love this place  I came in for lunch and there was a wait but it was worth it  The menu consists of several different sandwiches  salads  small plates and entr es  I ordered a pork sandwich  the corn side and split a few empanadas  Everything was made fresh and they had several different delicious sauces to add to your food  The place had a great vibe  I can t wait to go back and try more ,5,2019-05-08
This place gets better every time we come  Haven t had one bad dish and everyone working here is happy and helpful  Definitely one of our regulars on the food rotation ,5,2015-08-18
This is must see spot for everyone in Pittsburgh  locals or visitors  A unique menu  great atmosphere and great workers   We love the Picasso and the Provoletta  Don t miss this place  ,5,2018-12-18
Gaucho had been on my radar since they first opened however  I was unable to visit until recently on a trip back to my hometown to visit my family  My mom and I stopped by on a Friday around      pm  The line was relatively short at this time   but by the time we left it was out the door and around the block  When you finally make it past the front door  you are met with a chalkboard featuring the menu all of which made me salivate while reading it    My mom and I  after a few questions about the menu to the lovely cashier  decided to split the Rosemary braised beef sandwich with carmelized onions and horsey sauce  The beef was perfectly seasoned and quite tender  The carmelized onions added a nice sweetness complemented by the kick from the horsey sauce  They have sauces you can choose from and I highly recommend the garlic as it went well with this sandwich  The bread was fresh and was a stealthy vessel for the beef  We also split a side of mushrooms with shallots and rosemary  While these were excellent on their own  I d recommend adding them to the braised beef for extra flavor  Gaucho is BYOB and I noticed several tables  even on a Friday afternoon  taking advantage of this  We both got Diet Coke and never experienced less than half full glasses  Service was top notch and we were checked on a couple of times throughout our meal  I definitely buy into the hype here and would absolutely return on my next trip back to the Burgh ,5,2016-08-23
We arrived at        hoping to avoid the lunch crowd   It took us about    minutes to order and another       minutes to receive our food   It was well worth the wait   The pork sandwich and roasted corn were amazing   Just make sure you get there early   the line was out the door as we were leaving ,5,2016-06-20
we had empanadas   When we asked the flavors  we were told the main protien but not what else was included   some of which we do not eat ,2,2016-03-03
Gaucho has made a name for itself in recent years in the Pittsburgh food scene  Drive by later in the week on the weekend  you ll see a crowd of people wrapped around the outside of the building  Expect a long wait if you go at peak hours  However  I am always impressed with how efficient they are at running the place  they manage their dining room and seating patrons very well  You ll have long forgotten about your wait once you re seated with your food  The menu is very large  always tough what to order  Awesome that their sides make for great share plates  so always fun to get a variety of options for the table  An Argentinian restaurant is obviously heavy on and known for their meat  but expect to be impressed by everything else from their salads  rotating vegetables  sandwiches  etc  I was in last month and inquired about vegan options and was so happy to hear they use oil for ALL of their cooking  So any of the vegetables  breads  salads  etc   can be made vegan or vegetarian  My most recent visit I had the vegetable sandwich and I will say it was WAY too much bread  tough to eat and the fillings got lost  Salads are delicious and fresh  and all their sides are worth trying at some point  Potatoes used to be better years ago they were so crispy and really cooked well  but I wasn t too impressed with them this last time  You must get a sampling of all four of their sauces because each one is super flavorful and unique  A chimmichurri  ajo garlic  pimento red pepper  and cebolla onyinz a caramelized onion sauce  all available for take out as well  BYOB so come with a group and enjoy good company  Lovely ambiance inside with all the rustic wood ,4,2019-03-07
The immediate and subsequent surprises you experience when visiting Gaucho Parrilla are more than enough to warrant the five stars that this place has so deservingly received   I d heard tell of this place from a few friends  but for some reason when I hear  sandwich shop  and  the strip  I can only imagine Primanti Brothers  Sadly that image isn t as appetizing to me is it may be to other Pittsburghers   Nonetheless  on a whim  my wife and I decided to drop in here to see what s up and it has since completely rewritten the aforementioned image    Gaucho is the sandwich shop that the city that doesn t need another sandwich shop needed    For starters  the wood fired grill is expertly manned and the resulting meat and veggie creations are tender and flavorful    For enders  the guys running the joint are super friendly and seemingly unflappable    even in the face of a line out the door during a Saturday lunch rush   Great food  sweet vibe  and friendly service  What more do you want  Stop wasting your money on sub par  unhealthy sammies ,5,2014-02-22
The setup for ordering is poorly planned but the food makes up for every possible inconvenience ,4,2016-10-17
I love the food  the staff  and that you can bring your own booze  Luckily I did not have to wait in much of a line to order  The key is visiting this place on weeknights or early evening to avoid a line  Make sure you try all of their house made sauces ,5,2018-07-01
The smokiness of real wood they use for grilling gives the food an intense natural distinct flavor  These guys know their job  Ming Ming rocks ,5,2013-12-27
El Gauchos is one of my favorite restaurants in the city  The steak is always cooked perfectly  and it has such a beautiful char to it that makes it irresistible  If you re with a group of people  the asado platter is a MUST   all the cuts are delicious  All of their food is amazing and worth trying    Also  if you like bread  this place has some of the most amazing grilled bread you ll ever have  Trust me  It s better than garlic bread  That s how good it is ,5,2018-09-23
Lived up to the hype  I told myself that I wouldn t finish it  watching the waistline   but I couldn t resist  Everyone in the group was very pleased ,5,2016-10-22
There is an absolute good reason the line is wrapped around the block on the weekends for this place   it s incredible and worth the wait   I swear ,5,2019-01-23
Oh my god this place is amazing  I had never been before but I told my family we would try to get in because I had read great things  We went on a weekday  so the line was short  I had a steak sandwich  which was delicious   It s BYOB so we brought beer from East End  although everyone else was drinking wine  I felt a little out of place    We ended up coming back later in the weekend and waiting an hour  but it was still worth it ,5,2016-10-19
Oh man  is this place good  I had to wait about    minutes outside before I got up to order  but it was so worth the wait  Would defiantly recommend this  Mm mm good ,5,2017-04-17
This food will punch your mouth in the face  Big  Bold  Freaking delicious  The menu is a little confusing at first and the ordering system feels clumsy   but the food  I had the chicken small plate  husband had a sirloin  Best steak ever  So tender  so juicy  The sauces are all great but the red pepper is the best  If you are visiting  put this on your must do list ,5,2018-03-14
Gaucho Parrilla Argentina offered a delicious meal and a wonderfulunique dining experience  For those of you who want a short review  yes  eat here  amazing  great service  best steak burger I ve ever had  just do it   To be more detailed about Gaucho  it s enticing from the start  You walk in and order as if you were at a coffee shop  The lines are usually long enough to peruse the entire chalk board menu  They even have guides on what gaucho defines how they cook their meats  From there  you pay upfront and get seated  While you wait for your food  you have the ability to choose different types of sauces that will complement whatever entree you ordered  I sampled every single one   The food comes  and is outstanding   the service is excellent  and the atmosphere is inviting  The burger was a little more rare than I had expected but still perfection  I can t wait to try more ,5,2019-08-02
Overhyped  After walking past the restaurant many times  often seeing a line out the door  we finally had a meal there  The steaks  sirloin and ribeye  were well prepared  The roasted carrots were also good  The ordering process is deliberately slow to align with the preparation time  The result is a long queue in a cramped space  I have no complaints about anything that I ate  However  nothing was so good that I want to return ,3,2019-08-25
Amazing     Flavors and textures were awesome    Casual atmosphere   Well worth the wait ,5,2019-10-18
Food was very good  and I m not sure you could get better outside of Argentina or Uruguay  where I lived for three years and ate a lot parillada     Arrived about   pm  so our food  while delivered remarkably quickly  was tepid  not hot   The pastry for the empanadas was excellent but the fillings of the beef and chicken were not as flavorful as I had hoped   Both the sweet and the spicy chorizo were excellent  especially with the caramelized onion and peppers they came with   Salads were fresh and delicious  The grilled provolone  one of the great treats of the parilla  was a bit thin  and again  not hot enough  but still delicious   The  Gaucho  ribeye had great flavor but was certainly chewier than it s southern cone cousins   All in all a four star place   We will be back ,4,2019-11-17
Overall a bad experience long wait times which is fine  but management and staff were incredibly rude  Will not be visiting again,1,2019-07-27
The food was beyond excellent and service was phenomenal  I lost my CA drivers license on our east coast trip and had no idea where I lost it  I apparently somehow dropped in in this restaurant since they were kind enough to mail it to me  I already had a replacement for my license when I received it but having my original license in hand gives me peace of mind  Thanks for taking the time to mail my license to me  You guys are amazing  Wish we could go back as the food and service there is awesome ,5,2017-09-30
This local restaurant was absolutely amazing  I have the vegetable sandwich  The bread was nice and crispy and vegetables were full of flavor  I would definitely eat there again    ,4,2013-10-21
We are visiting from out of state and let me tell you this is an AMAZING place     We waited around    mins to order and then another    mins for our food but it was totally worth it  We loved the vibe there  super casual with   star food  My boyfriend said it s definitely one of his top   restaurants and we have been to top restaurants all over the world  We got the Cerdo  shredded pork   papas al horno  flank steak plate and shrimp side  Everything was great but we both agreed that our fav was the shredded pork plate  Go there and enjoy   It s worth the wait  ,5,2019-04-06
Went here for lunch and didn t realize it s all about the sandwich  You really need to know the food so you can make a choice selection  Meat was tasty buy need further review,3,2015-07-27
AWESOME food   You place your order from a large chalk board right as you walk in but they do have seating  There is always a line so be prepared to wait a bit  Everything that I ve ever had here has been great  All of the staff is very friendly and super helpful if you have questions  Don t forget the sauces   They have multiple homemade sauces that you can add to anything  You will not leave this place hungry ,5,2018-12-09
Gaucho s has an average rating of   stars  How can we NOT stop by   This place is bustling all hours of the day  We drove past Gaucho s multiple times during our stay in Pittsburgh and there was a line out the door every single time  Rain or shine  Don t be afraid  the line goes quick  I felt like it went a bit TOO quick cause I was still gaping at the wonderful menu plastered on the chalkboard wall    Con pan carne  ribeye steak sandwich       AMAZING  I didn t expect too much from a sandwich that simply has steak  chimmi  onion   peppers  but boy did they serve me wrong  The tangy ness from the chimmi is captured well with the sweet   spiciness of the onion   peppers  Such great harmony  You re probably laughing at my review  but you just don t know  All I can advise is for you to try it   Arrechera  flank steak combo   Steak plate served with salad   toast  Shoot I didn t even bother with the salad   toast cause the flank had me captivated  It was so juicy   tender  All   of gaucho s sauces paired well with the steak and brought out a different charm with each one  I was just a bit upset that the steak came out more medium well than medium rare as requested   Empanada    for      The reason why this review is bumped down to a    It was probably the most untasty empanada I ever had  There was no big difference between the chicken   beef because they both had the same overpowering bitter taste presumably from one of the veggies they used  The chimmi couldn t even save it    The interior is beautifully decorated with cute hippy accents around the restaurant  There is limited seating  If you go to the back room  there is a super low table you can eat on  The bench is higher than the table so you re basically crouching down over your food  Keep in mind that you can NOT sit down until you ordered  They highly enforce the  drinks must be on the table  rule so someone in your party can t save a spot while you order  Keep that in mind ,4,2015-07-02
Wasn t sure if it was going to be worth the wait but it sure was  We got the steak platter and sides  The food was amazing and my whole family loved it  even the kids  We would definitely eat here again and I highly recommended it ,5,2019-11-24
Excellent spot in the Strip District  Visited recently when I was in Pittsburgh from out of town  Great menu selection of appetizers  mains  including sandwiches  salads  and steak plates  along with sides and desserts  Was there during the weekday lunch hour  which can get quite busy  so plan your order ahead  or come during off peak times if your schedule is tight  The great    s playlist just adds to the whole experience ,4,2016-03-29
Mara is incredible opening the wine  I cannot believe how much it cheers me up  Come for the food and hang with Mara ,5,2017-11-26
Always a line at this little establishment but worth the wait  The menu is extensive and does take   or   but really maybe    read through to figure out your final decision     empanadas  chicken was the best and veggie came in a close second   The meats were well cooked   got chicken and steak and chorizo   Season was strong but tasty   What I absolutely will order again without a doubt is the flan    That was delicious  Service is very friendly   Only thing I would prefer is traditional style table service rather than counter service ,4,2019-06-28
This place was delicious  Good vibes  quick service  decent prices  delicious food  For     I got the flank steak with chimichurri  At first it may not look like it ll fill you up but it was satisfying  The salad dressing was good too  Def a good spot to check out in Pittsburgh ,5,2019-10-11
When the line is out the door at      pm on a rainy Saturday afternoon  you know it must be good  It is a one table in and one table out with no reservations kind of deal    but worth the wait   I ordered a couple of small plates as my entree  The empanadas were really good but a bit tiny for the price  The roasted vegetables were on point  The only disappointment was after salivating over photos of the brussel sprouts on yelp and then learning they were out of season  Bummer   If I am in Pittsburgh again I would return  But next time I would know to come about an hour before I want to eat  given frequent line ,4,2017-11-03
FYI  This place is where to be     The quaint counter style and simplicity of the interior have nothing in connection with the robust flavors and complex meals   The employees are helpful when ordering and have great suggestions   AND they have Coke in a bottle   I ate the hanger steak and mushroom   I got the small portion of both and still had almost a whole meal left   BYOB if you are to eat there   Be careful  there is limited seating  but the outside area is welcoming when it is nice out    Do yourself a favor and check it out ,5,2014-10-17
Fantastic  The reviews are all correct  The food was amazing  The toast was a bit overdone but still tasted great  Too bad it s   hours away from home ,5,2015-08-16
So delicious  Friendly staff and reasonable prices  Cute place too  Go early for lunch  the wait can get loooooong  once you try it you ll see why  ,5,2019-11-06
Gaucho is awesome  Wish they d build another location  There is always a line out of the door and for a good reason  The food is exceptionally flavorful  Get one of the steaks  and try a couple of different menu items  I also really liked the empanadas and the vegetables  It takes patience to wait in that line  but you won t regret it ,5,2018-12-28
Great value for your buck  The shrimp is amazing  the sauces too  The red meat was good but it hasn t blown my mind  I only get the sirloin so maybe I didn t hit the right cut with them ,4,2019-02-18
Oh ma wurd  How did I not come here sooner  This place is fantastic  Stellar service and amaaaazing MEAT  I had the large  el gaucho  salad with filet done medium well  Perfection  Sat on the patio with friends as well and it was a nice experience  My friend had one of the  chicky  empanadas and it was super yummy  Would come back here in a heartbeat   I appreciated how the employee who explained the meat choices did so very carefully and was considerate about taking his time with me and my friends  We weren t rushed and felt very welcomed   Get here early  The line forms out the door quickly ,5,2016-09-22
Amazing  This place is def bang for your buck  I ve been to fancy steak restaurants and this place on another level  It s BYOB without corkage fee and the food is delicious    One drawback was we waited  hr online  The places gets packed and there is typically a line outside to get in ,5,2019-05-06
Absolutely amazing  Worth the wait  Extremely nice staff and food is mouth watering  One of my favorite places here in Pittsburgh ,5,2019-03-18
Man this place is good  I ve been here several times and I ve always had to wait at least       minutes  However  the wait is well worth it   I haven t been disappointed with anything I ve ordered and for what you get  the price is super reasonable  I will keep going back ,5,2016-08-12
This place is tiny but well worth the trip   This is one of the best meals I have had in Pittsburgh ever     We got the mixed plate with steak  chicken and chorizo and every bite was amazing   Best steak I have had in years     Some yelpers said pricey for a walk in shop with no tables but the quality of the food far surpasses many fine dining places in Pittsburgh     This meal would easily cost you         at a fine dining establishment   If you go out to eat for the food above all else this is the place to go   Amazing   I have been thinking all week about my next visit     YUM   ,5,2014-02-03
Great quality food  Pork empanadas were great  Braised Beef Sandwich  add Avo   was best thing we had  Chicken was solid  not great  but good  Customer was outstanding  Would definitely recommend and come back if ever in area ,4,2018-06-06
We had the lamb chops  pulled pork and mushrooms  Everything came with salad and caramelized onions  The meats were so good in their own sauce  you don t need the additional sauces  I ate them all anyway ,5,2016-10-22
The food is amazing  I wish that there was more seating so it is hard to come here with a party larger than     ,4,2017-06-06
I literally have no idea why this place has so many good reviews  The portions are extremely small  I always need a to go container when I eat out  but I was still hungry after this meal  The food was okay  nothing grand at all  Way too expensive for the small portions and nothing special taste ,1,2018-11-04
We just had Argentinian food in downtown Pittsburg    amazingly tender meats   wonderful vegetables and tasty sauces  The owner chef is very kind and personable  His assistant is very fast too  Food is better tasting than many more far more expensive steak houses we have been to  There is a reason why this place had a all   star ratings       WELL DESERVED   STARS   ,5,2013-12-24
Great find while visiting Pittsburgh    We arrived on a Wednesday evening just after  pm  We were told they were closed because the line was already too long to close at  pm    I explained that I have specific dietary restrictions  that make it difficult to eat out and if I could I place a to go order and they obliged  We got our food by      and picnicked across the street    The food was delicious  I was thankful they were accommodating ,5,2019-07-06
This is hands down the best restaurant in the entire greater Pittsburgh area    I started coming here over a year ago and it s definitely the first place I take clients when they visit town   If it s your first time here  make sure you come here hungry because you re going to want to try a little bit of everything with your group in a tapas style   I usually order the Parillada Mixta  mixed Empanadas  Camarones  and the potatoes  These never fail me   UPDATE  Gaucho now serves alcohol which makes this a complete experience and you can still BYOB but there is a small cork fee ,5,2019-11-04
Yet another treasure of Pittsburgh  The food is to die for   Came here with a couple of friends on a night out and what a pleasant surprise  We stumbled upon it in the Strip District and it was just amazing  We all ordered the grilled chicken breast and papas el horno and they exceeded our expectations  I highly recommend this place to anyone in the Pittsburgh area who wants to try something new ,5,2016-11-05
If you are a lover of grilled meats  and really  I am convinced that those who say they aren t are liars        Apparently this is how I started a review of Gaucho in      and then never finished  according to Yelp  Whoops  Well  all I can say is that I love this place  their meats  their sauces  their ambiance  This is the place I tend to take out of towners for a lovely informal dinner  So  so good ,5,2018-10-01
The wait kinda sucked       hour wait   but totally worth it the food was freakin amazing  ,5,2016-03-06
It says this place closes at  pm  Got there at     pm and was told that they were not taking anymore dine in  just carry out only  Also  they have the last dine in customer in line tell other people that they are not taking anymore dine in customers  Shouldn t their staff be doing that   You all are too nice  As a patron  I would not want to take on the stress of turning down other customers and dealing with their complaints  No way  That is management s job  Very unprofessional of this establishment    While I was talking with my partner debating what to do  a staff member locked the door at     pm  Again  this place is supposed to close at  pm  We were then told that they were no longer taking dine in or carryout orders  Not sure if this is a Pittsburgh thing  but in every city that I have lived in  I have never seen an establishment lock their doors before closing time  Very unprofessional   Definitely not going back ,1,2018-06-15
Excellent service here  and staffs are all polite and friendly  I really love their beef   sorry for forgetting the name   and their salads is amazing  You can choose different kinds of sauces there  most of which are Argentina traditional sauces  and the spicy one is my favorite  However  with some unknown reasons  their mussels that day were not very fresh  although they guaranteed that mussels are received on that day  Also  the salmon and bread were overcooked that day  We could not have another piece of salmon cuz that was the last one on that day  The food wasn t give me a good reflection  but the manager there was very polite and gave us another bread with some desserts for our lost   Anyway  it s a good restaurant with different and amazing atmosphere  maybe we will come back later ,3,2019-07-16
As I am sure is the case for a lot of people  Gaucho was highly touted by many of my friends  I went on a Tuesday night at  pm and had to wait for about    minutes  Thankfully the line didn t quite snake out of the door  and I was able to stay inside in the warmth   The aroma of the wood fired grill and the somewhat rustic look of the interior combine to provide an inviting atmosphere  I liked the fact that part of the kitchen  namely the grill  is exposed to show a glimpse of the inner workings of the restaurant    My party of   ordered the paella and the asado platter  The plate of meat went quickly  but we struggled through the paella  The steak was good  but my favorite part of the meal may have been the sauces  each of the four sauces are delicious and masterfully compliment the steak  One reviewer recommended ordering the paella as a group side dish  which I definitely agree with  Additionally  Gaucho is BYOB  I did not know this but  fortuitously  other members of my party did   Overall  I felt that Gaucho was inviting  fairly priced  and had good food  I won t fault them for the wait time  as it isn t their fault that they re a hugely successful small restaurant  I will  however  admit that friends  prior praises of Gaucho placed lofty expectations in my head  While I felt Gaucho was good and maybe even worth another stop  I did not feel that it was exceptional  So  in a review of my expectations  Gaucho gets     ,4,2019-01-16
While in The  Burgh this place is a MUST   Delicious food  fantastic staff  great vibe   I had the Small rib eye for my entree    medium    Slammin     The sides  are shareable   brocolini   red potatoes w Rosemary  cauliflower  were all on point     Ot was busy when we were there line out the door  but wait was not bad at all   Ordered our food with the cashier   got a table and food arrived promptly and did not disappoint     If you want feel like a good steak  this place is great ,5,2019-10-20
Food is really great once you order it comes fast but the line takes awhile and we had to wait outside for a considerable amount of time and it was really cold  They don t take reservations so keep that in mind  Overall  lots of choices and you can get   different complementary sauces  my favorite is the yummy one  Reasonably priced  Good place to go with a group  It s BYOB  don t forget  Good portion sizes as well ,4,2019-01-27
Momijis is one of the best gems in Florida    They made me fall in love even deeper with sushi   My favorites are the Russian revolution sushi and the hibachi scallop and chicken over noodles    It is to die for   Also  It s a great family restaurant that s elegant yet very hip and very cool   Furthermore  I see that the manager WORKS VERY hard to please her customers  She is very nice  sweet  personable  fun  a cool person  I give a big thumbs up   ,5,2016-10-23
When I went here  it was my first time having Argentinean steak  so I wasn t too sure what to expect  The first impressions weren t too great  lunchtime on a weekend made the already small place quite crowded  so there was little room to navigate or try to understand the somewhat confusing menu without getting in someone s way    The menu was clear in what we could order  but the layout made it hard to read  especially the appetizers and veggies going down the side on the left  unless we were already in line  which wasn t optimal since we haven t decided on anything yet  As embarrassing as it was  we could not figure out the difference between the meats by themselves  was it just meat with nothing else   and the steak sandwich  meat plus   peppers and onions   And why were some of the pequenos just as expensive as the sandwiches     We saw a lot of people going with grilled corn  which looked delicious  but we couldn t find it on the menu either  later we realized we could ve just added it on   And an extra buck per vegetable on the sandwich   Call me spoiled but a really nice suggestion would be to just create some combo orders that include something like a sandwich  a small dish  and a drink  water didn t seem to be an option btw    Okay so we were probably mostly just being silly in failing to navigate the menu properly or get help  but we did end up with two quite delicious steak sandwiches of ribeye and skirt steak  Luckily we were able to find a table outside  and the steak did make up for the confusing experience at the beginning  It was juicy with a touch of char  and the entire sandwich was pretty tender  Next time we ll be sure to know what s going on and know what to order ahead of time ,4,2014-04-06
I was in PA over the weekend  and decided to venture into Pittsburg  but prior to going i needed a place to satisfy my meat cravings  I did a yelp search of course and the places that were popping up  i was uninspired  lo and behold i see this place Gaucho  It piqued my interest since it was Argentinian  What made this place a no brainer to go to was the consistent   star ratings  Yes  my decision was done Gaucho P  it was  I was not disappointed  i wasn t going to drive    mins to the strip and then order a sandwich  i went big and ordered the Asada Platter  which is more than a generous portion of   cuts of meats  grilled and seasoned to perfection  I ordered it to go  They were out of empanadas or as they said their machine was broken  The selections the seasoning the chimmichurri sauces that i scooped up fantastic  I have had   meals on those meats and i intend to come here again when i am in the area  Cheers ,5,2014-05-05
Great Service and wonderful food  Finished every last bite wishing that there was more  A little bit pricey for your typical college student but definitely a great place to BYOB and chill with some close friends  It s a nice and chic updated place they got there    If you re a fan of meat  it is a must that you go here ,5,2016-08-06
This place is for the meat lovers and meat lovers only  just kidding  they have salad and fish ,5,2019-12-08
Unpopular opinion of the century alert  I know this place is talked up quite a lot and voted on all sorts of lists  but I just do not get it  I ve been here two or three times and have been disappointed  The meat is always charred and I can not tolerate what I feel is purposely burnt food  It makes me gag  Blegh  I ve had good vegetables here  but um  I can make those at home no problem  A lot of their menu is in Spanish  at least the section titles  which I get and is cute but it confuses a lot of English speaking folks and makes the line move that much slower because YES  there will be a line  Nothing wrong with English in parentheses  Last time I was here I did enjoy their chicken sandwich  but would not make it a point to come back for another  Their sauces are good as well  I will give them that ,2,2016-03-04
When I first came to Gaucho  it was because the smells of meat caught my nose and I followed it   My girlfriend and I came in and we were the only people there  So we were greeted with a loud  HELLO  from all of the staff  As soon as we told them that it was our first time  they took us through the menu and answered every question  The whole time  everyone was smiling  music was playing in the background  and there was one guy just dancing  The whole vibe made me happy and couldn t help but smile   Gaucho does meat right  Steaks were juicy  tender  and seasoned perfectly  Seriously  other people should take note  good quality food  good technique  good flavors  I didn t care how messy the sandwiches were  I didn t care that it was wrapped up in paper and not served on a shovel chalkboard etc  What I got was honest  fantastic cooking  No fancy stuff to trick you into thinking something tastes good   I ve come back multiple times and each time has never disappointed  The have expanded recently and I haven t had a chance to go  However  the line going down the street speaks to how their passion for food has paid off ,5,2015-08-16
I am in the afterglow phase of one of the most amazing dinners I have had in Pittsburgh  Or ever for that matter  The flank steak is next level  The pork is amazing  The toast and sauces are top notch  Even the salad was good  The veggies have this interesting smoked flavor that works with the meal  Very few times does the place live up to the hype  but this was one of those times ,5,2015-10-07
Do not come here unless you are willing to swallow your food and leave immediately after   Because the food was delicious  my friends and I kept ordering more without hesitation  tipping generously along the way   Clearly the wait staff did not care about allowing us to enjoy our meals and desserts and attempted numerous times to clear our plates when it was obvious that we were not finished eating   At one point  as were drinking our coffee  one server gave us  a    minute warning    When I contacted management  they made excuses and said they would give us a gift certificate  but never followed through   Arrogant and tacky   ,1,2018-04-29
Best taste and value if you want to eat in the city of Pittsburgh  This place doesn t just go up on a Tuesday  it goes up all day erryday  Delicious food and flavors  doesn t matter if you get steak  fish  chicken  vegetables   I don t eat pork but I regret it every time I come here  because I bet its that good     Gaucho was my first exposure to Argentine foods  and man was it a homer  I got the braised beef the first time  They gave a sandwich the size of a damn brick and spots were hit  I also got the chicken sandwich and where it didnt measure up to the braised beef  it was a     in taste  They got some awesome sauces available too  I like the red one I cannot recall the name  Second time I came here I got the braised beef again  but I also tasted the Ribeye and Fish sandwiches  those two were both also incredible and comparable to the Braised Beef that I got    We also got the the Empanadas  which were a great little side    This place gets packed  so to save yourself the time of waiting       mins for your food  call ahead and order it  i am yet to successfully do it  but thats my plan for the next time    A Pittsburgh Ace in cuisine  Affordable  Clean  Good Service  Foreign Tastes that don t disappoint  BYOB    Bottom Line  This perfect deserves a perfect rating and that is exactly what it gets from me ,5,2015-09-07
My husband and I went there on a Saturday afternoon and it was absolutely packed  They had to stop taking orders for fifteen   minutes to allow the chefs to get caught up  The wait was certainly worth it  We ordered the ribeye sandwich  chicken sandwich  a side of vegetables and side of potatoes  Everything was cooked to perfection  I don t think I have ever had a better pulled chicken sandwich  the meat was juicy but still large bites  not shredded  It was truly delicious and everyone in there was raving about it ,5,2015-03-28
The place is good  Great food with reasonable price  While you have to wait in long line to get served  but it s easy to get seated  because there is plenty of space outside  and on the upper stairs  Easy to find parking lots  but not free ,4,2018-05-28
Hopping place   Long line but nice to talk to people   Very neat menu  so many choices    Ordered Asado platter   A lot of steak   Sauces are delicious   Chino sauce is especially tasty  but pimento has roasted red pimento peppers in vinegar   These light up all of your tastebuds   Roasted vegetales round out the meal   Nice spot in the Strip  close to the city    Great for date night    The sauces bring out the flavor of the meat and sensations stimulate the palate   The portobello mushroom was exquisite   This is a must visit restaurant in Pittsburgh ,5,2015-12-13
The food here is fantastic and the prices are very reasonable  Although this is my first check in here it is not my first visit  I ve been here  x before  I won t dwell on the food  let others gush  The only thing I don t like about it here is the ordering system  No reservations  The way it works is you order at the counter and then they seat you then bring your food out to you  This doesn t sound bad until you discover how popular it is here  The line often snakes out the door  which also doesn t sound bad except during a Pittsburgh winter  snow or rain  Once you get inside the large chalkboard menu makes you kinda glad for the wait as your mouth waters over all the choices and you likely will over order  The staff here is friendly and pleasant  Be sure to BYOB  bring your own beer or bottle of wine or else enjoy a limited selection of soft drinks or water  Btw  to give you an idea of the wait I wrote this while in line  Don t let any of that discourage you  the food is worth every minute    If you enjoyed this review do me a favor and vote for it or throw me a bone of a compliment,5,2019-09-26
How anyone can give this place anything besides   stars is beyond me  Hands down the best tasting meat you will eat in the greater Pittsburgh area  The line can get VERY long during peak meal times  so be prepared to wait     minutes before you even get in the door  There s absolutely no question that the food is worth the wait though  you will not regret waiting in line ,5,2019-04-13
Tried Gaucho at lunch and was very pleased by the food and the service   two    somethings held down the crowd that was exploding on to Penn   I had a braised beef  carmalized onion and horseradish delight   Also tried the spicy Chorizo   a side of tatters and washed it all down with a blood orange soda   They sell out of empenadas so I missed testing   Food was great only complaint is no room to enjoy dining in   I had a seat but the crowded space and setting was sub prime ,4,2014-02-01
I was in town for one day and saw that Gaucho had been getting rave reviews  Boy were they correct  I ordered the Rosemary braised beef sandwich which was juicy and every bit as delicious as I imagined  Definitely a go to spot in Pittsburg ,5,2016-01-13
Stopped by here to eat randomly and it was absolutely delicious  I live out of state and I m going to be back in town soon  I ve already made plans to stop here for lunch at least once while I m back ,5,2019-09-24
Don t really understand the hype if I m being perfectly honest  The food isn t that special and the wait is ridiculous  I could get a steak just as good at a steakhouse and not waste   hours  The process for ordering and getting food is also complicated and unnecessary  All of the staff members are super friendly  That s why they are getting a few stars ,3,2019-10-17
Absolutely amazing food and service  Such a great place  Husband said it s the best steak he s ever had  The empanadas were fantastic and the side of roasted carrots are amazing  Must go to in Pittsburgh strip district ,5,2019-09-26
This was probably the best meal I have had in Pittsburgh and I cannot say enough good things about this place  I got the steak burger with avocado and pickled onions and it was cooked to perfection  And the toasted bread that it was served on was also fresh and delicious  The burger was so flavorful on its own  though they do offer a nice array of sauces to add more flavor  They have   sauces that you can try as much as you want of  and each sauce is tailored to a specific kind of meat  though you can combine how ever you want  I liked all of them  but the one that was meant for the red meats was my favorite   The wait staff was very friendly and helpful  They have a system where you order as a whole group up at the register  you sit at a table  and then you will get all of your food at the same time  I personally like this system better than the typical waiting for the check system   My friend and I got there at about      on a Thursday  and we got there just as crowds stared to pour in  This place gets super crowded  so I would recommend getting there before      on Thursdays Saturdays at least   Overall  one of the best meals I ve ever had and definitely the best in Pittsburgh ,5,2019-07-23
This place was hoppin  not like a fogo de chow  this is pick from a board and get your drink  head to the table they bring your food  and it was superb  Steak and chimi chiri was excellent  pepper and onion were the best  Only thing was not impressed with were the empenada  had steak and chicken kinda dry  Veggies were awsome  Will definitely go back  Staff was great as well ,5,2019-09-20
Arrived at Gaucho for lunch  just after noon  and the line was already out the door and around the corner  I had heard so much about this place but apparently missed the concept  because I was very skeptical as to if this place could really be worth it   This is not a traditional sit down style restaurant  you order your food at the counter upon walking in and are then able to choose a seat  they do have an outdoor courtyard area  but with the heat we chose to stay indoors  where you will be served cleaned up after  Thus  while the line outside is a little inconvenient  it moves quickly and is very deceiving of how long you will have to wait   I was still skeptical of this style of dining at first  but for lunch it was great    I was very overwhelmed with menu  mostly because everything sounds so good and all the salads sandwiches sides are very reasonably priced  approx     for a sandwich  there are a few bigger ticket items on the menu such as their paella and vaca  meat  platter  but by the sounds of it they would make it worth your dollar   The staff is very friendly and helpful explaining the menu and making recommendations  I decided to take a healthy route and got the argintino salad  which is the same as the gaucho salad but with more  this took me a minute to understand upon first look at the menu   You can pick really any cut of meat to add  and the host helped me decide on the flank steak  I guess I wasn t really paying attention to what I was reading  because when it came out I was veryyyyyy pleasantly surprised that their were also potatoes on the salad  like an Argentinian play on a Pittsburgh salad with fries   My guest got the bondiolo sandwich  and said it was the best sandwich he s ever had  even though I only got the smallest bite  I would probably agree   I wish I had more time in Pittsburgh to go back and try some of the others   We left absolutely stuffed  excited to finish our leftovers later ,5,2016-06-10
Closed their doors an hour before their scheduled closing time and shut off their phones with only half capacity  Gaucho wants to shepherd their customers through the restaurant with the same care as the beef they serve and care little about the customer experience ,1,2019-05-18
Good food  However the owner was rude  We walked in and started to look at the menu on the wall and he immediately came over and started barking about keeping the path clear for existing customers  I won t go back because of that d     no matter how good the food was ,3,2017-08-07
Came here with my SO on a Pittsburgh trip and decided to try Gaucho Parrilla because of all the great reviews  While I was definitely INCREDIBLY impressed with the rib eye platter  and would come again on future trips solely for that  I found the sandwich and veggie platter disappointing    We waited in line for about    minutes  the line is outside  beware on hot days  before were ordered and were able to sit  It seems that the hold up isn t so much space seating as much as the fact that there is only one person taking orders  so hopefully the restaurant adds an additional register soon    The food   Rib eye platter  This is why you come  for the straight meat dishes  The rib eye was DELICIOUS and I m not normally that into meat  It was cooked perfectly and was amazing on its own  but there are dipping sauces in case you want any extra flavor    Rosemary Beef Brisket  Good but VERY oily and very heavy  I would skip this and get one of the cuts of meat w salad bread instead    Small veggie platter  We ordered the veggie platter for something healthy in anticipation of eating way too much meat  but unfortunately the veggie platter itself was oily     Peach cobbler  Solid  but no different than any other peach cobbler you ve had     BYOB so come prepared    Come early to avoid the line ,4,2016-07-13
My husband and I decided to try Gaucho for my birthday yesterday  after hearing nothing but praises by friends over the past couple of years  They were certainly not wrong  We waited in line for maybe half an hour  which for good food is not long at all  I had the pollo and my husband had the carne sandwich  We also ordered a side of potatoes  Everything came fast  it was hot  and amazing  My husband said it was the best steak sandwich he s ever had  We tried all of the sauces with our potatoes  our favorite hands down was the red pepper sauce  All of them were tasty though  We will definitely be back again ,5,2018-12-16
Amazing restaurant with plentiful vegetarian options   at the top of my list of favorite Pittsburgh restaurants   I normally get   empanadas    daily types of empanadas  with one of them always being vegetarian  and the Vegetale sandwich  As I am not a huge fan of mushrooms  I usually request that provolone cheese be used to replace the mushrooms in the sandwich  which the employees are always happy to oblige with  with no hassle or extra cost  Keep a look out for the seasonal pasta special as well  a good mix of tangy aioli sauce and vegetables  Also  the condiment sauces are to die for  Be sure to use these generously with any entree you order   BYOB  I d recommend going at off peak hours  for example    PM for early dinners  to ensure the line does not get too long  since they don t take reservations  ,5,2018-06-04
O  M  G  Best food I ve eaten out in like forever  Terrific service too  Fun ambiance  You go here  You go here now ,5,2016-06-22
This place is definitely worth the hype  Every time I ve been there the line has been out the door  but it moves very quickly  They have someone delegating where you should sit which helps with the wait time worry around finding a place to sit  I m on a strict diet for lifting and their meat veggie options fit into my diet  Highly recommend the flank steak ,5,2018-04-23
The food is so good  Even the grilled bread is mouth watering  I love that it is byob  We stopped in for dinner one night  We were asked if we wanted to go downstairs for the chefs tasting  It was     per person and worth every penny  We got to try a little bit of everything on the menu   I highly recommend  ,5,2018-03-30
Excellent quality meats and so many to choose from  The hype is real  I got the carne sandwich with filet mignon and the papas al horno on the side  Everything was so fresh and you could tell they use high quality ingredients  Steak was tender and cooked to perfection  The caramelized onions and roasted red peppers were the perfect accompaniments in the sandwich  A little heavy on the bread but you can order it breadless or open face  I just took off the top piece and ate it with a knife and fork  It was perfect  Papas were served with rosemary and roasted garlic cloves  What stands out are the   sauces that are self serve on the  nd level   chimichurri  ajo  garlic   cebolla  caramelized onion   and pimenton  smoky red pepper   My favorites were the cebolla and pimenton  Put some on every bite to experience the different flavor combos   Food came out promptly and service was friendly   Will definitely stop by again to try more items the next time I m in town ,5,2019-07-10
There is a good reason for the   stars review  It is just awesome  The sandwiches are spectacular and so tasty  Great job guys,5,2014-03-09
I had the Palletina Decornado  I forget the spelling   The grill lamb strip was not what I expected   But the Empanadas was fantastic ,5,2017-11-26
Great food but the wait was CRAZY  Didn t order nearly enough food to quench my hangry ness  Shrimp was fantastic but not quite filling ,4,2018-02-08
WORTH THE WAIT  I think this was one of the only dinners that was eaten in complete silence because we were enjoying the food that much  Seriously one of the best meals I ve ever had   The large rib eye  the rosemary braised beef sandwich  a small order of vegetables  and grilled corn was perfect to leave us very satisfied    I think the flavors of the meat and veggies were so amazing that when we tried the empanada  it was just average so I ll skip that the next time ,5,2016-05-03
Stopped in the newly expanded joint on Saturday for lunch and it was just as delish and magical as the first time I went  I love the new set up  and particularly all the windows  Its also such a cool concept where you seat and sorta serve yourself  but there is also staff that comes around to check on you and refill drinks   LOVE this place  as always   If you haven t come here yet  what are you waiting for  I will say that you should get their early  We arrived around       and there was a line  but by the time we left around       the line was out the door ,5,2015-10-15
I d rather avoid the long lines  and BYOB  and go to a good Brazilian BBQ place   The food here is fine  but just not worth the wait and ensuing chaos ,3,2019-03-01
Very busy every time I go but it is worth the wait  Great food and priced reasonably    Chorizo sausage is the best and they let you bring your own wine with no corkage fee,5,2016-06-19
Come by around  pm and they were out of half the items we wanted  We were staying in a hotel with an infant  so we decided to get take out  We ordered a few sides and the Ribeye Vaca  large   We were assured it came salad as stated on the menu  When we got back to our hotel we noticed it was clearly absent and weren t about to walk back to the store for a salad   The relatively small steak and toast were not worth the price paid   Last time we went  in their old facility  it was one of the best meals I have had   Sad ,1,2015-07-30
Came here after a day s work and finishing a job site  Let me tell you this food just made me sooooo happy    We had the Pollo al a parilla with a beautifully cooked flank steak with corn pudding   The food was sooo good   The service and staff was excellent as well the decor was homey and earthy    I will definitely be coming back here ,5,2016-08-10
Wow  Gaucho has some of the best steak  We came around   pm on a Friday afternoon  so there was a bit of a line  With maybe       or so people in front of us  the line moved pretty quickly    After ordering in the front  they tell you what table to sit at  When your order is ready they call your name  All of the sauces are so flavorful and fresh  I liked the caramelized onion and of course the chimichurri too    The steak in the sirloin was delicious  So flavorful  juicy and that perfect smokiness from the wood oven    It s well worth it  and Gaucho has great vibes too  Don t miss it ,5,2019-08-11
Excellent service  delicious food  friendly and attentive staff  and ordering paying at the counter first gets the boring stuff out of the way  We were staying close by and every time we walked by the place it was mobbed  always a good sign   We popped in a little after    AM today and since they had just opened it was much quieter  The food came out so quick  This was our last meal in Pittsburgh and it was easily the best  We were pleased to have accidentally saved the best for last  I m sure I ll be dreaming of that ribeye plate from     miles away with an ache in my stomach    if you read this  please order it on my behalf ,5,2019-10-16
The meat here is excellent  That deserves a five star  The ordering process makes some sense for the business based on how they operate   However for the customer it s just confusing  I had about four to employees invoked in between ordering  serving  and clearing my table  They were all nice so while confusing still five stars    I ordered the sandwich  Too much bread    but other than that delicious  So my tip just order the meat  Forget the sandwich  Delicious but what you really want is the meat   This place is one of those amazingly good restaurants with some stupid quirks    Oh and Jesus    Great bathrooms  Literally smelled fresher in the bathroom than outside ,5,2019-08-06
This place is fabulous   I got two sandwiches so I could share with my friend   This place is more for take away or outside dining which is kind of small   The day I went it was very hot outside   And at around   pm there were   people in there waiting until I showed up then the small store front got packed and even hotter when they fired up that wood grill    The man who took my order was very friendly  The sandwiches were delicious   I got the filet sandwich and the chicken and can honestly say these were the best sandwiches we have had in a long time   I tried most of the sauces and they were very flavorful   I dropped the sandwich halves to my friend who was working and he texted me to say  how much he loved them and how good the sauces were    This place is a must try  I can t wait to try more of their items ,5,2013-07-08
My friend and I went here for her birthday today  I have never been here or heard of the place until the other day when my friend was talking about how good the food is  I decided to try it today to see for myself  I ordered the chicken and beef empanadas  the roasted carrots with goat cheese and the yerba mate tea  The empanadas were delicious very filling   the roasted carrots were probably the best I ve ever had especially with the goat cheese on them they were perfect and the yerba mate tea was good it s unsweetened though so you have to add your own sweetener to it  They have salsas set up in the front of the restaurant you can get yourself to add to your food  I would definitely come back here they have so many different options on the menu I d like to try more of them  They also have BYOB that s always a bonus ,5,2017-05-23
This place is amazing  Don t be discouraged if there s a line outside because it s worth the wait  I ordered the flank steak and it was the most tender and flavorful meat I had and the bread was so crispy  I will definitely be coming back to this place  Don t forget to bring your bottle of wine ,5,2018-10-09
Visiting Pitt from Philly and this is easily the best restaurant I ve ever been to  Everything on the menu is amazing and perfect  from the meats to the salads to the side dishes  The atmosphere is friendly and warm and the lines are definitely worth it ,5,2017-08-06
Been living in Pittsburgh for almost a year and after a few failed attempts of coming here on a Sunday and also coming way to close to closing time  we finally made it    And the line was long  But we finally got our carne and bondiola sandwiches  and they were absolutely delicious     I asked the girl who took me order what she would recommend for my carne sandwich  and she said the sirloin  which was a little tough  I will get the ribeye next time  My husband had the bondiola and he loved it more than the carne  My only wish was that they didnt serve it on ciabatta bread  We also got the gaucho papas and maiz  which was fine  we ll just be sticking to the meats and sandwiches in the future though  because they are incredibly filling    and I would much prefer not making room for anything else other than my carne sandwich  And the sauces     My favorite is the garlic ,5,2015-08-28
Hands down the BEST food I ve had in Pittsburgh  The hype is real  The food is incredible   Customer service was good too  I totally understand why people brave the mood swings of the weather and wait outside in a queue to get a table    We got four dishes  The que que chicken  steak platter  mushrooms  and flan for dessert  Each of them were delicious on their own  perfectly seasoned and the balance of the flavors were fingerlicking good  The sauces they have also paired quite well with everything    When my friends and family come to visit  this restaurant is on the top of the list of restaurants I will introduce to them ,5,2019-11-21
Can t believe I waited four years to go to this place while my son was in college in Pittsburgh  Truly a local treasure ,5,2018-11-11
This place has   stars for good reasons     The food is extraordinary and the service as well  Very complex tastes  We tried the Pollo sandwich  the fillet steak plate and a grilled corn  All were out of this world  Best steak I ve ever had  Don t miss their food if you re in Pittsburgh ,5,2014-11-28
Lives up to the hype  I d wait in line for a couple of hours to eat here    We came at  pm on a Friday  No line   winning so hard  I think the magic starts here in two ways  First  the wood fired oven they use  so the type of wood  and the high temp   and the freshness of the meat  which is all from regional providers   Beyond the meat  ALL of the ingredients were so fresh  and such high quality  that you wonder how the prices on the menu aren t higher    Everything we had  empanadas  provoletta  chicken sandwich  and the gaucho platter were divine  Of course  their four housemade sauces are seemingly made by the hands of angels   My   year old niece begged us each day after to take her back here  This place could be a Paleo Paradise  but the bread is so so so good  from a local bakery  can t recall which one  that you re going to go all in on the carbs  This is one of those times when each bite you take  you have a foodgasm  and you  perhaps awkwardly note  that everyone around you is experiencing the same thing     Not cheap by any means  but you re getting top quality food prepared with expert precision  so worth every penny  Highly recommended ,5,2017-01-31
Second time at this restaurant and I still love it  Unfortunately we had to wait    minutes on a Tuesday evening to order but the food was still delicious  We wanted to order empanadas as our appetizer but they only had   left at     pm    I got the Argentinio salad and it was huge  The papas  potatoes  were slightly hard but all the other vegetables were grilled nicely and served hot warm over the salad  Mixed some of the veggies with the sauces they provide on the side and it was a treat  My friend got the catch of the day  Salmon  and it was cooked very well and was soft and flakey  definitely recommend this   The service is always great and everyone is super friendly and casual ,5,2018-06-20
You best come early to this place if you don t want to wait   There is a reason why the line is always long   their food is simply delicious  They make homemade sauces and their meat is seasoned to perfection  I personally get the rosemary braised beef  either as a sandwich or on one of their salads  Staff is always helpful and knowledgeable about their menu  You order at the entrance then sit and your food is brought out to you  Check it out ,5,2017-05-25
One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh  as their food is very flavorful   In particular  I really like their ribeye steak sandwich as well as the potatoes  Gaucho papas    I took a star out because they re somewhat victims of their own success    the restaurant is always crowded with a line out of the door and the seating is limited  even after expanding their space ,4,2016-02-10
Gaucho offers almost  every  kind of meat  and it s my favorite spot in town for a cheap but delicious sandwich   If you re unlucky you might have to wait for a bit  sometimes the line is     people   but it s totally worth it and hopefully it s not raining outside  You order at the counter  and then wait for the order at your table   I typically get the sandwiches like bondola or braised beef with a bunch of sauces  Salads are tasty and pretty big  this is about the small salad  ,5,2019-05-04
Amazing food  Great service  I ve been there about       times the food is high quality every single time  The only downside is that long line outside the place which you can t really fault them for  The braised beef sandwich is absolutely delicious  The quality of ingredients is noticeable and the menu is diverse  I m glad I found that place  Definitely a go to place when I m in the area,5,2019-10-17
Amazing food   worth the wait   Every single item melts in your mouth   I don t know how they manage to consistently produce excellent food with amazing flavor   We come back again and again   You can t go wrong here ,5,2016-02-21
On the pricier side  If you aren t in the mood for meat you ll have trouble here  I cane here for my roommates birthday and had the Provoletta and two empanadas  Everything tasted good but I will probably not be back ,4,2018-11-10
Probably one of my favorite establishments in my very brief adventures in Pittsburgh  I got there after work and was greeted by a line that circled the shop onto Penn Ave  This was probably the most unfun part since it was starting to get cold and I forgot my thicker jacket  Several patrons had the right ideas of bringing some beers to enjoy  which was the better idea it took almost    mins to get inside  Side note  BYOB and no corkage fee   I ordered the carne con pan  which is basically a steak sandwich with roasted bell peppers  caramelized onions  and chimicurri inside  I chose the ribeye  cooked medium rare  of course   and I was not disappointed  These folks know how it cook it right  HOWEVER  skip the roasted bell peppers as they overpower the meat  The extra sauces salsas on the side it made it that much better  And if they have it  grab a side of the marinated eggplant   straight fire   Good stuff  I ll be back again soon when the line is shorter ,5,2018-11-09
I can t believe I haven t reviewed Gaucho yet  The food is amazing  especially the sauces  I normally don t eat beef  but I do here  because it s so good  The menu is very reasonably priced for the quality and quantity you get  and it s not a concept that you see in every city  at least I don t know of any in Portland yet   I always take out of town guests here as a starting point in our food crawl tour of Pittsburgh    I try to come at off hours or order ahead for pick up  I stick to the steak or Rosemary braised beef sandwich  I ve had the fish and chor y pan  but wasn t too impressed  Beef is definitely the star here ,5,2017-03-02
Amazing food  The sandwiches are the best deal as you get to pick your cut of meat for the same price  It s an order at the counter then sit kind of place  Make sure your whole party is there when you walk in  They won t seat you otherwise  You can also bring in your own bottles of wine  No corkage fees ,5,2018-05-05
It doesn t surprise me at all that this is the    Yelp restaurant and has been for quite some time  Whenever anyone visits from out of town  I try to take them here  The food is AMAZING  Seriously some of the best meat I have ever had  I ve had a bunch of different cuts and none of them have been disappointing  I usually go for one of the steak platters  although they have sandwiches and some other dishes as well  The platters are a great value since it is a good portion of very high quality meat  a piece of toast and a small salad  I ve occasionally gotten a side of veggies or brussel sprouts to share and YUM   Seating was a nightmare when it was about half its size  but now that they have expanded  there is much more  I have occasionally had to wait for a table  especially with a larger party if going during peak hours  I ve driven past this place when there is a line out the door  I would try to go during non peak meal hours  but it is worth the wait anytime    The staff are always pleasant and extremely friendly  This place is A  all around and I can t wait to go back for more ,5,2015-12-16
Actually  I had my reservations because I was worried this place was  just hype      however  Gaucho s goes beyond just  meat ing  your expectations  For anyone who argues otherwise is mis  steak  en  trust me   There tends to be a long line out the door for a reason  The food speaks for itself  For the quality of the meats  prices are very modest  There s no unnecessary  fluff  when it comes to Gaucho s  It s authentic  raw  pun unintended  and straightforward  You want well cooked  nicely seasoned meat  Go to Gaucho s    FOOD  I tried the  Asado Platter  which features   different types of meat  about     pieces each  cooked medium rare  the only way meat should be cooked     delicious  If I were to be more critical  some of the meat was a little overcooked  but this didn t discourage me from eating everything  Needless to say  I didn t really have a reason to complain  The accompanying sauces  which were in cute mason jars  were also great  I personally liked them all  I had a lot of fun pairing certain cuts with different sauces  I wish I had a salad or something acidic to cut through the heartiness of the meats    but again  this isn t something I m complaining about  more so me planning my next trip     SERVICE  The workers were very chill and friendly  They definitely know how to handle  hangry  people professionally    ATMOSPHERE  Although I didn t get to see the  upstairs  or elevated platform  I enjoyed the  vibes  of the place  Everything felt rustic  raw  again  pun unintended  and warm   Would I go again  Yes  but I ll be sure to go on an empty stomach  portions are very generous  in my opinion  ,5,2018-10-11
Good not great  Going to this place for the first time I had extremely high expectations based on the reviews that I read  My date and I each got a speciality sandwich along with an appetizer and everything was just okay   Other than the meat being cooked to perfection  nothing was out of this world  We are looking to go back to this place soon to give them a second chance and to try something not from the sandwich menu     I would like to point out that the BYOB aspect of this place is great and the service was very good ,3,2018-12-06
I m not quite sure I ve had a REAL steak sandwich prior to my encounter with the ribeye carne steak sandwich here  My word   what do I say    First off  let me say their customer service is AMAZING  I called for takeout within the hour before closing and apparently they ve turned folks away in the past but the gentleman on the other end of the line made an exception for me  I m SO glad they did  I placed my order for the carne and grilled corn and was a advised it would be about    minutes    I arrived on the scene with my gangsta lean    oh wait  that s a song  Sorry not sorry   Anyway  I walked in and was smacked in the face with the aroma of garlic and roasted  grilled meat  If they made a perfume out of that  I might be tempted to buy  I looked around and noticed the homemade chimichurri sauces  There was a group of   in front of me but the sweet guy at the counter looked around them to greet me and offer his help  I explained I was there for pickup and he turned to grab my bag of yum  He proceeded to explain each of the chimichurri sauce offerings and neatly packed up a hefty sample of each one to go  Did I say the customer service here is AMAZING     I headed back to the car so I could head towards home to conquer and devour     Once home  I opened my bag and pulled out the little parcels  each of which wreaked of yummy garlic  First I opened the sandwich which was huge  It had onions which were perfectly grilled and sweet  The red peppers added a subtle sweetness which complimented the sandwich  The meat was tender and the taste screamed Brazilian steakhouse   Yes  I said Brazilian   carry on   I mean it was perfect  Even the bread was fresh and perfect for this meal  Oh God  I m sweating and salivating just thinking about it  Now on to the corn  It wasn t the frozen stuff or baby corn on the cobb  It was a whole cobb of corn roasted to perfection and wrapped to go  Yummy   Just about every other Yelper thinks the same   this place is AWESOME and it s officially on my faves list ,5,2014-11-30
I have a couple good things to say  a couple not so good things to say   However  Everything aside our lasting impression was made the last few moments as we were about to leave the waitress approached our group spread out her     dollar tip and said  this is all you left   just wanted you to know  If that s okay with you then fine  I just did a lot    I did not drink that evening  everyone else took advantage of the BYOB  Someone in my group handed her    more dollars    before I could stop them   The cash she claimed to  have left over  as her tip didn t match with The money she was given  Additionally  she did not include the     dollars in tips off those who paid with a credit card   I won t be back  it was so uncomfortable  And I feel she was dishonest  whether by mistake in counting wrong or on purpose  In general not okay  Update  I got a message asking if my review was for the wrong place  we were in the lower bodega area  where there are wait staff  Just want to ensure it s clear since the top portion of the place must operate very differently ,1,2018-11-09
Although this is a fun and casual place for dinner with friends  I think the seasoning on the food here is overwhelming  The steaks are also pretty expensive for the amount you get  about     slices for small  which typically runs me         Their sauces are colorful and interesting  but way too oily  I also don t understand why they would serve the steaks with chimichurri sauce if they think we would also like to try their other sauces  The rub for the meat is also too salty anyway  I wish I could appreciate all the flavors in their sauces  but I think to save on costs they dilute the sauces down with oil  I have tried to reproduce some of their sauces at home and I can guarantee they are more interesting with less oil    Food also takes awhile to be served  but they are BYOB so drink it up while you wait it out    Overall  I keep coming back mostly for the cool vibes and decor  but the steaks could be so much more ,3,2018-02-04
Not worth the hype    First freeze your ass off outside for    min  then another    min till you order   Then they bring everything out at the same time   Appetizers and entree   Watch your food turn cold as you eat   Kills your appetite  Not coming back,1,2019-11-10
A must visit in PIttsburgh   Wish I lived closer so I could eat here every week ,5,2016-01-22
Brilliant  Cannot go wrong with any of the selections  Definitely recommend trying the empanadas and then on of their sandwiches  DO NOT FORGET THE SAUCE ,5,2019-11-06
I ve been here twice now and each time gets better and better  I am OBSESSED with Gaucho  The menu is huge   I feel like you can t go wrong with whatever you get  There are so many options  from sandwiches  to small   large plates  to appetizers   more  This place is incredible  I ve never had a wait before ordering which is always nice  The first time I was here I got their catch of the day which happened to be salmon  It was INCREDIBLE  And the serving of salmon was huge  It was served with a side salad and a piece of toast  I swear their toast is made from God himself bc it is just that good  The next time I went I made sure to grab and extra order of toast  I ve tried the sides of spaghetti squash  yams  and potatoes  Everything is amazing  There is so much flavor in everything they make and it is just all so amazing  I got the pulled pork the last time I was there and it was the best I had ever had in my LIFE        for sure ,5,2019-01-13
I have been here for lunch and dinner  I have to say the food has always been great  Fair warning  there are no reservations nor a waitlist  You have to stand in line  usually wrapping the building  outside  That being said it is completely worth it ,5,2018-10-14
Can t say enough about this place  It s great  Arrive early for lunch  it gets packed ,5,2017-04-11
Overall  Solid steaks  Good flavors   Very casual ambiance  Was slightly confused about ordering food first then being seated  But I actually liked that it s not like swanky steakhouse  Like sauces are self serve and they have to go bags to grab so you don t have to wait for the waitstaff to get your cheque to go boxes   Food  Asado Platter   ribeye was the winner for me  To be honest  I didn t care too much for other cuts  But my friends each liked different cuts so it worked out    Ribeye is the fattiest  Flank was leanest  Skirt was thick cut and juicy  Ny strip was somewhere in the middle in terms of fatty and lean  The fifth cut whose name I cannot remember was also very lean and most meaty gamey imo  Good for sharing  The only caveat is that their medium rare was more like rare   idk if you like that  great  But wasn t fan of how tough the raw center was to chew   Shrimps on skewers are off the menu item that are also great   grilled and herbed    Sides  good portion for the price  Beef Empanadas were great  Sweet potato with caraway seeds and sunflower seeds were the group s least liked  We wish we got something else instead    Desserts  dulce de leche shortbread cookies were so good  Could eat that every meal  Shortbread is very soft and dulce de leche isn t too sweet  And the whole cookie is coated with toasted coconut shreds    Sauces  prob the second best thing after steak    different kinds  All delish  Kinda wish they served tortilla chips so I can dip them in ,4,2017-02-09
Everytime I go there is always a wait but it is well worth it  To avoid the wait go at   am on a weekday but by noon there is a line  Taste a little bit of everything  you wont be disappointed ,5,2019-03-16
I ve been dying to try Gaucho for so long now  So much hype surrounding this place and I must say it did not disappoint  However  I m not the biggest fan of the first come first serve concept    First let s talk food  to simply put it    amazing and absolutely delicious  We tried the beef and chicken empanadas  both were really good but I felt the chicken was a little dry so I dipped it in sauce but still really good and I d get again  They have a few different choices for empanadas and they are written up front so they change them out  We also had the grilled shrimp and they are grilled to perfection  They have that perfect char grilled tastes  You get   shrimp and they are a good size  We opted for the summer squash because we wanted a veggie side and it was good  A nice size side perfect for   people and only    so definitely worth it  For the main course we had the parrillada mixta which consists of strip steak  chicken  and your choice of sweet or spicy chorizo  we chose the spicy   This dish also comes with   pieces of grilled bread which is fantastic  I wanted more bread  The steak was cooked perfectly  The chicken was my least favorite there just wasn t a wow factor for me  Spicy chorizo is also delicious  This dish was a great combo to get your first time to try the different meats so I recommend  It s a big portion too  we had leftovers to take home  They have   different sauces for dipping and all of them are amazing  Honestly  the sauces may have been my favorite part  I can t pick a favorite cause they all are so good  I dipped everything we got in each one  Gaucho is also a byob establishment  I think our total was around     for all that food which really isn t bad for a good meal    Gaucho is located in the strip district which means finding parking can be an issue  It is also first come first serve  no reservations  Since this place is so good there is often a line that wraps around the side of the building which is my least favorite part  I wish they took reservations and you didn t have to wait but there is obviously a method to this madness because it s always busy and a very successful establishment  Since it s byob I feel like people will also sit longer to finish their alcohol which makes the line longer  They have a sign that indicates    pm is shift change and they have to feed their employees so the restaurant runs much slower  I went on a Saturday and got in line around      and was inside and ordered about    minutes later which was not too bad  I will say I wouldn t wait much longer  Food is great but I don t want to wait in line any longer than an hour for it    The inside is small which is also another reason the line can take long  You order at the counter  they seat you and bring the food to your table but you do not have a server  The employees all seemed super friendly and everyone had a smile on their face  The vibe is super casual and relaxed    I do recommend trying Gaucho if you haven t  The food is unlike any other food I ve had in the city  I will def be back but maybe on a week night when the line isn t so long ,4,2019-09-13
I lived in Argentina for a year and this is pretty damn authentic and unique  Highly recommend ,5,2018-11-07
One of the tastiest meals I ve ever had  I got the b n mi sandwich  pork loin   papas  potatoes   and maiz  corn on the cob   There was a long line but it was well worth the wait  It actually gave me enough time to look over the entire menu    Everything was delicious  That may have been the best corn on the cob ever  The restaurant was clean with a rustic look   casual feel  The staff was very friendly   attentive   All four of the homemade sauces are incredible  and you can take to go cups  I particularly like the pimenton  spicy pepper  and ajo  garlic   They don t serve alcohol but you can BYOB  and there is no cork fee if you bring wine ,5,2016-07-11
They do steak the best  Their plates and small plates are the best  Their sandwiches and other beef dishes are only okay  The sauces are excellent  Definitely do not skip their sauces ,4,2018-11-29
Went on a Saturday around         waited in line for about    minutes before we were inside the restaurant to place the order  Ordered the Asado platter for medium rare but     of the meat was well done to medium well  The temperature of the meat also wasn t as hot or fresh as expected  The potato salad is good  I would go back to try other things ,3,2019-05-05
We d gone a couple years ago before the renovation and it was one of the best meals ever  We live pretty close so I m not sure how this didn t turn into a go to after that    However  we went last week with friends  I know the waits get long here but it was early evening and we thought we d be safe  From line to food  it was probably       minutes  Kudos to these guys for having a devoted following  However there isn t enough room to accommodate the folks waiting  it s cramped and in front of the door which blocks thru traffic  I loved that they offer Mexican coke  something I treat myself to every time I see it  Meal wise  we were all obsessed with the toast  Man  is that good  Between the four of us we got a huge chunk of the menu  the sides are definitely a strength here  The potatoes  bread  grits   all really good  My steak was unfortunately stringy and the small platter it was all served on was pretty small for the amount of food on there  The service was thoughtful and kind  Tbh  this probably would ve been a four if some of the details  waits and serveware  were a little more thought out  I would definitely go back but in a more obscure hour  for sure ,3,2018-01-15
This place was incredible     Ordered the Rosemary Braised Beef sandwich and Roasted Cauliflower which were both unbelievable in there own right   Top these two things off with their Ajo and pimenton sauces  and if I lived in Pittsburgh  this would be the only place I d ever eat lunch    Also  I really liked how the owner found people a place to sit before they ordered their food   This service was very much appreciated  especially when your in a very busy restaurant ,5,2017-11-18
Meats and sauces  Boom  Just out of downtown  this place serves up the goods  Pork sandwich on my plate and steak sandwiches for my friends  All given rave reviews  Additionally  loved the empanada and potatoes  and the service was outstanding    Seriously  order as much as you can afford and gorge yourself ,5,2015-01-16
We ate there on Aug   st and it was phenomenal  The sauces  the meats  the sides  boom   It was great   I do not recommend wearing overly nice clothing as the deliciousness drips off the sandwich and can easily get on you   The staff was very friendly and helpful with questions on the menu choices   I anticipate they will need a larger location very soon  Well done ,5,2013-09-03
I grew up in Argentina   specifically in Patagonia  I ve eaten in some of the better restaurant of Buenos Aires and this is a far cry from Argentine food  Very disappointed with the lack of authenticity in the chimichurri as well as the empanadas  I realize it s difficult to get Argentine beef but they don t even try  The worst thing is the style of restaurant  I guess they want you to feel like your being herded like cattle ,1,2019-03-23
By now it s just known that Gaucho is one of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh  I ve never had a single menu item that wasn t absolutely perfect  I always look forward to the bread and sauces which are mouth watering  The line is usually out the door  but it s always  always worth the wait  The outdoor seating area is just as charming and warm as the indoor  I ve enjoyed an array of the menu items  from the steak to salad to sandwiches  The time and skill put into cooking these amazing dishes is always apparent in the amazing flavor  If I won the lottery  I would probably eat here every day ,5,2018-11-24
Attended a private function in the basement room  The space was so cool  like eating in an old European building or secret grotto in South America  Candles everywhere  and a great staff  The food was just amazing  can t say enough about the bread  the cooked meats  the Chimichurri sauces  the grilled vegetables  the dried meats  the cheeses   I ate everything but the shrimp  allergies  and each bite makes you moan and roll your eyes it s so good   Can t wait to come back and try the main restaurant  The wait is worth it    ,5,2019-08-14
We came on Thursday for a bit later lunch and were surprised at no line  While our first visit  it will not be our last   Casual  yet excellent food ,5,2019-08-22
Wow that was a lot of meat  We got there at around noon  and just missed the big rush  Once inside there is a huge line outside  This is definitely not a place for vegetarians  We got the braised Rosemary beef and the pulled pork sandwich  both huge  both delicious  Meat was perfectly cooked and the bread was perfectly toasted  We also had the empanadas as a starter which were amazing  Took our sandwiches to go  which we have been able to stay and enjoy all the different sauces  Definitely a must if you re in Pittsburgh ,5,2018-08-11
You can only log into Yelp so many times and see Gaucho listed on the main page as a  Best Restaurant  with a zillion   stars reviews before you start to feel like you might be missing out  I get it Yelp  I need to go to Gaucho  So to Gaucho I went   The place is tiny with limited seating  but we went around      on a week night  and it was perfect   still quite a few customers  but not overwhelmingly busy at all  I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and my husband got the rosemary braised beef    it was described on the menu simply as  f  kin fantastic   which we got a kick out of  Then we split the veggie empanada  grilled corn  and potatoes as sides   So  let s talk about this food  In this case I can only channel Janice from  Friends  and say OH  MY  GOD   Have you ever been legitimately sad when your meal is over and all of your food is gone and wished that it was socially appropriate to order a second dinner  That is how I felt about my meal at Gaucho  The pulled chicken sandwich had tender  melt in your mouth chicken  sweet caramelized onions  crunchy  well seasoned potatoes  and meaty mushrooms  all mixed with their KILLER garlic ajo sauce and served on bread that was just the right balance of chewy and crispy  I didn t know it was possible for so many textures and flavors to be combined so perfectly into one delicious bite  but Gaucho managed to do it  As for the sides  the hands down favorite were the potatoes  Oh my  those potatoes were bursting with flavor  super crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside  and pretty much the best potato I have ever eaten  The grilled corn was also well done    perfectly cooked and was especially yummy when smothered in one of their   sauces  And lastly  the veggie empanada  though the least favorite thing we d ordered  was still damn tasty too  It was packed with tons of flavor  but it was little dry  so I d recommend taking that for a dip in one of the sauces as well   I asked my husband how his rosemary braised beef was  and he was shoveling it in his mouth so fast that all he could do was point to the menu board description where it says  f  kin fantastic    Well said  When he finally could talk  the only thing he uttered was   I m having a love affair with this sandwich    Ordinarily I might be worried  but hell  I d understand if he leaves me for Gaucho   Not only was the food out of this world  but the service and atmosphere were too  The guy running the counter  I assume he was the manager  was super friendly and clearly has a passion for the business and the food  He eagerly talked us through the menu  explained the different sauces to us  and even later checked in while we were eating to see what we thought of the food  And I love that we could see back behind the counter into the kitchen  where several bearded men were happily drinking their Yuenglings and grilling up our food  It felt like I was having a chill meal in someone s hip but cozy house instead of a restaurant   It is maybe a touch on the pricey side  but so well worth it for the quality of the food  In fact  I m pretty sure that I d be willing to promise my first born in exchange for a gallon of their garlic ajo sauce  Btw    a glorious bonus was that I was still able to taste the flavor of that sauce in my mouth for the rest of the night  I was really sad when it was time to brush my teeth before bed  Yep  it s good stuff   Moral of the story  Go go go go go go go go go ,5,2014-11-06
Very nice  and not just beef  which is about all you get in Argentina  Try to get there about       a m  on weekend mornings  or you ll be sorry   ,5,2019-04-30
The food is pretty good  The way to go is two smaller plates instead of an entree  It s a little confusing in the sequence of ordering b   u r seated but just roll with it ,4,2017-08-26
The food is very good  The atmosphere is wonderful  Their service is extraordinary  They were so  polite and thoughtful  This was especially evident when they didn t kick people out who had been lingering there for hours without ordering more food  This is a BYOB place  They do not make money from liquor sales  As a result  they have to turn over tables at a rather efficient rate  It was shocking to me how entitled bourgeois drunk people are so inappropriate to such a lovely staff  You can put a saddle on a jackass but it doesn t make it a racehorse  Bravo to you staff of Gaucho ,5,2019-07-22
There s no flaws in the menu   Not a single thing I ve had here has been disappointing  The experience is interesting as you pay before you are seated and there is no waiter service  This takes away from the restaurant feel but also gives you the privacy of not being bothered during your meal  The drawback here is that you can t really add to your order if you under ordered  This can be remedied by over ordering which is encouraged because as I mentioned before  there are NO flaws in the menu    Fish  good  Shrimp great  Everything cooked to perfection  That being said  I d recommend getting it a little bit more towards the medium  medium rare side then the rare side   because they will serve it RARE   like raw  Even so  it is delectably delightful meat and all the sides and sauces compliment well and are all more than reasonably priced  BYOB only makes this the best place to bring a date    It s only a little bit upsetting that I wanted more but waiting in the line for potatoes or more vegetables was just not worth it and you can t just cut everyone and add to your meal or ask your waiter  So order everything ,4,2016-03-16
The meats are phenomenal here  I always go for the asado platter which is full of flavor and juicy  The food is always fresh and the atmosphere is wonderful  The sauces that come in huge mason jars are so tasty  You must try all of them  They are all unique and delightful    The interior is full of vibrant colors and warm wood  It makes me feel at peace and happy whenever I m here  I m always satisfied when I come here  My only complaint is that parking is difficult here there is not a parking lot and sometimes if you re lucky  there will be street parking nearby    The customer service is great here  Everyone is always so smiley and accommodating  I also appreciate the order first then wait for your food process at Gaucho  It s very efficient and helps with the almost always long line here ,5,2019-01-29
One of my FAVORITE restaurants in the Burgh   Great food  casual  relaxed atmosphere and BYOB   what more could you ask for    We are FREQUENT visitors   The food is always cooked to perfection and the ingredients are so FRESH   EVERYONE   from those that assist you in finding a seat  to those that take your order  to those that act as severs   is SO friendly and accommodating   We took my dad to Gaucho tonight to celebrate his birthday  he loves it there and always requests it  and  of course  it was a great experience  We brought a cake and they kept it in the fridge for us during dinner and then brought it out with a candle and sang Happy Birthday  I did not ask them to do that  they just did    I have never had a bad meal at Gaucho   Some of our favorites include the Qui Qui Chicken appetizer  the steak burger  the rosemary braised beef sandwich and the salads are AMAZING    So fresh and delicious    The only drawback to Gaucho is that they don t take reservations  so you may have to wait in line  We try to go at  off  times to avoid the line  but the food is DEFINITELY worth the wait if you must stand in line   They have a great system in place and run like a well oiled machine  though  so your wait will not be unpleasant in the least   If you have never been there  RUN  don t walk   I promise you will be glad you did  ,5,2018-03-15
One of the best restaurants in town as can be seen by the constant lines wrapped around the building  The food is a        The flavors and variety are out of this world  It was recommended to us to try a little bit of everything which is exactly what we did  empanadas  tostado  corn  carne  mushrooms  and all the sauces  Can t wait to return for more ,5,2019-05-21
I am not judging the review based on the wait time  because we went on Saturday night for dinner around   pm  which is definitely their busiest time and the two hour wait was expected  Plus we had a party of    no reservations allowed at this place    The food was definitely lived up to the reviews   especially the steak  The ribeye sandwich was a steal really  just     for   oz of meat that s well seasoned and had great aging and char  This is not the tender  flavorless steak I m used to from steakhouse chains  This Argentinian style had texture chew and great flavor  We had fun trying the   sauces with the steak but it honestly didn t need it  I felt the toast was really hard  not sure why other reviews raved about that   We also got the qui qui chicken but that was really not the most unique thing  go for steak for sure  I d invite friends here who are visiting town  and use the     hr wait time to catch up,5,2019-09-24
This place is so delicious  Packed with people as always so the wait time is a bit long  But the staff has always been very friendly and the meats are super tender and juicy ,5,2019-05-23
This review is fairly late  short   sweet  but I have yet to forget about how amazing the food was   Gaucho s   This is the sandwich by which all other sandwiches must be judged   If you were allowed to give only one five star review per Yelp account  this would be my ultimate end all be all five star   Amazing   I am forever spoiled     Hopefully these incredible chefs gather a solid following and branch out to other cities and venues   Holy foodgasm  This is what Pittsburgh should be known for        awesomesauce   Can t wait to go back   A     ,5,2015-02-13
This place is a gem    More then a gem it is everything that is good about eating   You smell this place before you see it  The aroma is mouthwatering   The meat is perfect  If Francis mallman were here he would shake Anthony s hand  I have never tasted a more well balanced chimichuri   Thank you for added this to the Pittsburgh landscape   Bottom line  The food and service will change your taste buds forever ,5,2013-12-28
A gem in the rough  We came here on a whim  finally   and it was about  pm and we were already waiting outside  the line didn t seem too long  so we didn t mind  However  the line did move pretty incredibly slow  for the not so huge menu people ordering off of  I should have checked that this was BYOB  no fees  Which would have made standing in line with our  yo a breeze  Once we ordered  the waitress checking us out was incredibly nice and professional  Additionally  every worker there thereafter were extremely great  made sure your water was tipped off  and worked collectively great together  I ordered the chicken  boob  sandwich  my fianc  ordered the steak burger  It did not disappoint  Incredibly filling  Chicken was very tender and well seasoned  his burger made medium was perfectly juicy topped with avocado instead of cheese  It was honestly half an avocado  While we waited for our food  we tried the sauces with some toast     the toast was perfection  it had the real wood burning toast flavor but without it tasting burnt  A real skill     there is not one flavor of sauce I did not like  It was hard choosing a favorite  Ultimately  i liked the chimmy  and the roasted red pepper    oh and the garlic  shoot  the ajo was fine too  Honestly  i would give this a solid    but I am going solely off my first experience  waiting  no options for my picky  yo  but clearly we know how to be prepared next time ,4,2017-06-03
Well worth the wait if you have one  I went during lunch and it only took    minutes to get seated  Food is awesome  Definitely one of my favorite spots  Had the pulled pork sandwich and veggies  Sandwiches are huge  You don t need a side to fill you up but I would recommend just so you can try more awesomeness  Staff is friendly  prices are on par for what you get    Do it ,5,2019-09-12
I love it here  I mean  what s not to love   Except for the wait   I could eat here everyday  The chicken sandwich is my favorite  and the side dishes are also incredible  I always eat my meal way too quickly so I don t have any pictures unfortunately   you ll just have to take my word along with all of the hundreds of other yelp reviews ,5,2018-08-15
Love this place  The only downside is that long impending wait for a table  Other than that  best BYOB place in town I would say  The food is great and very fairly priced  Grab your favorite bottle of wine and get there early so you can be seated quickly ,4,2017-10-08
I heard they had     vegetarian items on the menu and I thought I must go  I ordered a pabrecito  one of the vegetarian options  and it was horrible  The grilled veggies I was promised consisted of a single bell pepper and there was too much salt  Not recommended for vegetarians ,1,2015-01-25
The food that I ordered was good    sides  Had to send back one of the sides because they gave me the wrong one  My daughter ordered the        steak platter that had no sides with it  was over seasoned  WAY OVER PRICED They forgot the grilled bread had to ask  twice    Would not go back ,3,2018-06-30
I have various food allergies and experienced nothing but the best at Gaucho  I was informed that Gaucho uses      olive and corn oils  no blends  and no butter or milk  at least in what I ordered   I had the sweet potato mash  mushrooms  avo salad  and tried some of the steak burger  Very friendly service and cool atmosphere  Definitely recommend ,4,2017-01-10
Service is absolutely AWFUL  My roommate and I went with our mothers and we are          We told our order several times at the front  keep in mind the line was non existent  so they weren t rushed or busy   They were so distracted by my roommates real ID that they forgot half of our order  They seemed very suspicious of her ID even though it was real and she was with her mother  Then we got four wine glasses at the table  and the woman came over again and asked to see our IDs when I clearly was not drinking  Best part  they asked us to leave immediately after we finished because there was a short line  No one else around us was asked to leave  and there were people who were there longer than us  Good food  but absolutely not acceptable behavior  I work in the restaurant business and that is the first rule  you cannot ask people to leave  I do not recommend ,1,2017-01-05
Hands down my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh  it never disappoints    I always take people from out of town here and it s always a crowd pleaser  Just be prepared to wait in line for an hour if you go on the weekend at any time ,5,2017-06-23
Very few words are needed  Long lines  get there early  Amazing food  Hard to pick   Awesome sauces  Give them all a try  Small salad was a perfect size for lunch  Lots of veggie choices too ,5,2016-08-06
This place is so good that I signed up for a yelp account  While traveling through PA we stopped at this gem  Unique food with flair  The service was outstanding  The atmosphere was more casual then expected  but the food did not disappoint  If I am in Pittsburgh again I will come back for sure ,5,2014-04-05
Coming from our road trip from Chicago my fianc  and I decided to stop by Pittsburgh and check out the city    Arriving during lunch hours   I yelped for some restaurants and this came up   I never had Argentinian food before  so what a great way to have it  plus I couldn t say no based on the  pictures and reviews I read    We arrived at the restaurant right when it opened so we were greeted by a very friendly worker  The menu is written on a huge chalkboard on your right  Since it was my first time here  a helpful server was nice enough to take us through the menu and also telling me some of his favorites  The way it works is that you order from the menu  then you pay and then they bring the food to you  I ordered their el guacho salad with flank steak and a side of sweet chorizo  The fianc  got the chicken and papas    After you pay  you grab your untensils and your chimi sauces  We didn t wait long at all  The meat was delicious  season perfectly  well  juicy and tender  I asked for my flank steak to be cooked well done and I was even surprised that my meat was still juicy and not chewy at all  I got that small salad which was packed with lots of greens  corn  red radish  asparagus and few slices of avocado  The sweet chorizo was also juicy and perfect  I tried my finance chicken which was moist and season well  If you want to add more flavors you can dip your meat in their chimis    I enjoyed my meal and I would highly recommend Guacho  I would advise to prepare yourself by looking at their menu before walking in and know what to order because the lines can get long fast  Other than that I give it a   stars,5,2015-08-22
The food is soooooooooooo good here  Wow  One of the best places I have ever eaten at   ,5,2017-01-30
I ve been here twice and am overall very pleased with my experiences  I went around lunch and there was a long line but it moved quickly  The staff was nice and accommodating  I was pleasantly surprised that even though it s not a server based model  they still walk around and check on how the food is and if you need more water  The space is beautiful and modern  exposed brick  chalkboards  hardwood floors  subway tile  textbook hip restaurant  I had a Rosemary braised beef sandwich that hit the spot  I took a tip from a regular and used some of the sauces oils they make available  The bread was crusty and fresh  the beef was flavorful and rich  I felt like I was eating a really good meal  You definitely feel like you re getting a good value for your money   I wasn t blown away but I was totally satisfied    Parking is tough because    Strip District  no sides included  it s hard to find a seat bc they re so popular ,4,2015-09-04
Ummmmmm      amazing      The food is so good  They have really good options for vegetarians  However  you have to watch what time you go here because they start to get really busy ,5,2017-03-11
Amazing sandwiches  Had to stand to eat  but worth it anyways  The empanadas Haf a great spice to them  We also tried the skirt steak and spicy chorizo sandwich which were awesome   both had peppers and caramelized notions  yum  The bread is fantastic  and the chimichurri is sooo good ,5,2014-03-01
Believe the hype   All  Of  The  Hype   Gaucho is that good   I made my maiden voyage to this meat mecca on a warm muggy Friday afternoon   The line was out the door   all in all about a       minute wait   The queue fits surprisingly little few people indoors  which might be my only gripe about the place   Ambience  From the outside  you would not know this place existed   Tucked away on the far end of the vibrant Strip District  I actually mistook the kitchen entrance as the front door   Once inside  you find a really tastefully done interior   Wood finishing is prevalent throughout  covering everything from the the condiment islands to the plates that the meals are served on   Taken all together  it s a great match for the food that Gaucho serves   Service  In two words   friendly and attentive   Despite being an order at the counter establishment  the table bussers appear to double as  servers   checking in on us several times after we sat down  doing everything from offering silverware to refilling water   Great model   Food  Nothing I ve written would have mattered if the food didn t match in quality   and boy did it   Collectively  our group ordered   sandwiches  ribeye  fish  and pork   a side of potatoes  and an empanada   The potatoes were golden and crisp on the outside  creamy on the inside   Perfect for dipping into one of their   sauces    sauce sidebar  try them all  over and over and over   Each one was delicious in its own right  from a classic chimichurri to a roasted red pepper   The right dip to bite ratio is       just trust me    Ok  back to the food   I ordered the fish sandwich  which came with perfectly charred white fish  cod  perhaps    sweet carmelized onions  and a soft chewy bun   Great bun to meat ratio  great balance of flavors   Each sandwich came with the same bun  but slight variants on the meat accompaniments  peppers for the steak  mustard for the pork    all were delicious ,5,2015-07-23
This is a go to favorite place for take out or bodega night private event  The salads  sides and rosemary braised beef are my favorites   Get spoiled during a private event and go for the paella  It won t disappoint  promise  Estis is our favorite server for private events  The line to eat upstairs is the only negative  and can t even call it that   get takeout and no line will effect your meal ,5,2017-12-19
It is by far one of the most tasty places I ve been too  not to mention the price is very fair  I got shrimp and pork chop here  I think the meat here is excellent however seafood is prob not their best  perhaps due to their geographic location    I would come back here in a heart beat and try out other cuts of meat ,5,2018-01-05
I brought my parents here after reading  Gaucho Parrilla Argentina was dubbed one of the top places to eat in the country  in the Pittsburgh Visitors Guide  The food definitely exceeded our expectations  It s kinda insane how good the food there was    ESPECIALLY the sauces  chimichurri  garlic  onion  red pepper  ,5,2017-05-31
Honestly don t understand why this place is so popular  Service is great but food is not edible  I went there twice and almost everything was burnt both times    If you are gonna burn everything and then call it authentic Argentinian grill  I don t have to pay for the price and could just do it at home,2,2017-07-28
Believe the hype  Carne sandwich is amazing  Try all four sauces  I can t decide which is my favorite  They are all distinct and amazing  Get the toast for a buck and dip in all the sauces  Staff is super friendly and helpful  Awesome spot ,5,2015-12-10
I brought some friends from out of town here on Saturday around  pm   And just like Gaucho was before the renovation  there was a line out the door    but as expected the line and wait wasn t too bad   We waited for about    minutes to order and easily found a place to sit for a party of five     Everyone was very pleased with their food  some saying it was the best that they ve had in a very long time   I generally eat a mostly plant based diet and fish every now and then so I got the fish sandwich   It was pretty large and well worth the     I paid for it  however I think I would have preferred something other than tilapia   I think it s a pretty cheap fish for a place serving amazing steaks   The non meat items seem to be considered an after thought  so that was a little disappointing for me   However  this disappointment was saved with the corn and papas   My boyfriend loves this place  so I m sure we ll be heading back  but I d be reluctant to order another fish sandwich   The non steak and sausage items don t appear to get much love ,4,2015-06-16
Tried this spot with some friends on a hunch only to discover that it was the home to one of the greatest steak sandwiches ever  I got the carne with flank steak and it was more than enough in terms of both portion and flavor  They also have a great environment with an incredibly welcoming staff  Excellent spot ,5,2017-10-20
The food here is fantastic  We ordered family style  We chose   meat dishes and two sides which was more than enough for   people  I don t remember the names of the dishes   the first was a mix of chicken  chorizo and steak  All amazing  The second was the chorizo three ways  Again  perfect  Like always my favorite part was the side dishes  We had the brussel sprouts that were sauteed in bacon and brown sugar  I loved them so much that I ve been making this at home ever since  The second was the sweet potatoes topped with marshmallow  This was the highlight of the meal  I think with all the intensely flavored meats and salt you need this sweet and savoury dish to balance the meal  I live for a BYOB  remember to get your own glasses from the side bar and have a drink while waiting for the line to die down ,4,2015-11-08
In town for a visit from a Maryland  Decided to venture to Gaucho for the Carne sandwich  It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had  Also enjoyed the papas  in all of the   different sauces  and the spicy chorizo   This will become a regular stop when in the area ,5,2014-07-15
I love smoked food  This place makes some great sandwiches  All of the meat is smoked fresh and the prices are great  The dinners are a bit more  I haven t had them yet  But I m sure they re pretty awesome too ,5,2015-10-28
Yep  Gaucho is about as good as it gets  I went last night with   of us    total  We waited in line outside for about    minutes before we made it in  I ve had some sandwiches before here  so I know how good it is  Everyone else knows also I guess  We brought a bottle of wine which they corked for us for free  I got the house Paella  It was amazing  It says feeds        of us got that as our meal and I gave a leftover box for all   of us  Carne sandwich  Shrimp side with sage and butter  Fish sandwich and a burger  Everything was awesome  The servers are fast and there to fill up your drink  Everyone is friendly  I highly recommend this place  Not expensive  great food  great service  One of my fav spots in the burgh ,5,2017-03-31
Long wait  but totally worth it  Everything we ate was seasoned perfectly  Price is very reasonable  The sauces are perfect  especially the chimmichuri   The only negatives are    the wait and    how small and cramped it can get  Think of it like the ultimate food truck  You order your food  then take it to the seating area behind the restaurant  Had to wait about    minutes for our food  Probably wouldn t have minded so much  had we been seated and sipping on a brew ,5,2014-08-06
I ve been meaning to try Gaucho for some time now but they re only open on certain days and they close so early  Well  it was definitely worth the wait because the sandwiches are AMAZING  The skirt steak sandwich melted in my mouth and the roasted tomatoes and sauces complemented the sandwich perfectly  Highly recommended ,5,2015-06-25
Worth a visit to give it a try   Atmosphere very noisy food quite good    Pittsburgh has a lot  of good places to eat and this would not be a place I would go again    We were a group of   and none of us was impressed with our meals ,3,2015-10-14
Holy hell  thank you for Gaucho  Meat is life  Meat is good  Meat is my savior   For all the millennials   meat is   don t judge me       Bae   Anyway  I used to drive by Gaucho all the time when I lived in the Strip District  naturally  After I got off the bridge and headed straight  let s just say my nares hit Liberty Street before I did   All the worries of a stressed out resident physician in Pittsburgh were relinquished when the smell of Buenos Aires markets hit my nose    The smell of a slow parilla style roast of our good friend who  moo s  overwhelmed me everytime I would pass by    My go to  The asado platter   all the meats from our farmer friend cooked to perfection  The meat is some of the most succulent I have had in Pittsburgh and I have to say  Pittsburgh does meat pretty damn well  My second favorite  the Paella  Let s put it this way  I am allergic to clams and mussels but if ever I had a craving  an epi pen is going straight into my right thigh before I devour this pot of edible gold  The saffron gives the rice such a airy spice that it takes me back to flavors of Spain  though this is Argentina we are talking about   Regardless  well done   Kudos Gaucho  thank you for being here   Highlights  Meat cooked to perfection  parilla style layout  outdoor  garage type feel like some of the places I ve visited in Argentina   beautiful spices and herbs with a strong m lange Pros  Above Cons  sometimes the wait is BRUTAL  But well worth it Recommend to a friend  Yes Recommend to family  No  because we have been all over and obviously have had authentic style food in South America and they will probably not go anyway   Just being honest Go again  I go once a week at least ,4,2017-03-22
There s really not a lot to say about Gaucho that hasn t already been said elsewhere  better   Great food   I always make time for a stop here when I visit Pittsburgh   The wait times can be long  so go prepared   And by go prepared I mean look at Google   We went on      on a Thursday  and walked right up to the counter   I realize many may not have that kind of flexibility  but if you do then it really helps ,5,2017-08-03
Was there on a  Tuesday evening  There were not many customers  My soup was cold  My friends food was cold and not good  The mixed drinks increased by    in a week period  There were no pecan balls which come with dinner on Tues nights  They had no ice cream at  pm  Definitely has changed from the former Kretzler s Tavern  So much for the original family place to eat  ,1,2017-03-15
A friend who lives in Pittsburgh suggested I try this place while visiting for a long weekend  After waiting in the long line  outside I might add  for over an hour you have to order your food at the counter and cannot change once you order  The food was definitely delicious  but after waiting in the long line I was not nearly as hungry as I initially was  Two positives to the place is that it is BYOB and the menu has an enormous amount of options to chose from  some of which sell out rather quickly though but are constantly coming back as the night progresses ,4,2018-08-27
Gaucho is my favorite place and I will definitely go there often  We went on a Tuesday afternoon around     ish  We had no wait   Our family from San Diego was in town and said they wish they weren t leaving the next day so they could go back   We ordered the pasta salad with baby peas  each of the empanadas  a charcuterie board  lamb  shrimp  cauliflower  green beans and tostadas and we loved every dish  Our only disappointment was that we got full and could not eat all of it  Every dish we tried was flavorful and amazing enough to stand on its own but even more amazing with the  salsa   We tried all the sauces with each dish and were excited about the way every sauce complimented every dish in  the most delicious ways  We each had our favorites   I ordered a bread pudding to go and was just slightly disappointed as it was not as amazing and over the top delicious as the meal we had  That s ok though  I still give Gaucho a   star review ,5,2018-05-02
Had an A MAZING dinner in Pittsburgh strip district tonight   We had a few people so we could sample a variety on our first visit  The   cuts of beef were all cooked perfectly and the shrimp were very good also    We went specifically to try the empanadas and were only disappointed because they only had a few left  However  the ones they had available were ours and the were delicious   We also sampled a variety of vegetables  The zucchini  sweet peppers  onions  mushrooms and asparagus were all grilled to perfection   That being said  the grilled corn on the cob is a must    The potatoes were somewhat average  but they are potatoes so what can you expect  but to quote my wife     the toast tastes like Christmas     All topped off with very friendly and attentive servers and four varieties of  sauces to top your meal  you can t go wrong at Gaucho Parrilla Argentina located in the strip district of Pittsburgh    You might think the prices seem marginally high when you walk in but I promise you ll think you got a bargain by the time you leave    This was our first visit to Gaucho  but certainly won t be our last ,5,2013-06-09
This place is really good   GOOD    The FOOD is just great   Pork sandwich  roasted potatoes  grilled brussels sprouts with bacon  La Casa salad   all really tasty and well prepared   The bread on the sandwiches is delicious  especially when toasted    The setting is fresh  clean  and un cluttered    The service is great   Everybody is helpful and cheerful   OPPORTUNITIES    The entryway and ordering area is too small   Even a short line goes to the door  so you sometimes can t really walk in    The chalk board menu looks nice  but is hard to read quickly   Confusing or fuzzy menus can create anxiety for some patrons  especially when the line is short and you sort of have to order now   Overall  this place is great   If you have not been here  give it a try ,4,2015-12-11
Got the steak sandwich  It was super meaty and I was definitely in love with the vegetables in there    The empanadas were a bit  doughy  and dry  Maybe because I m used to fried ones  I d skip out on them    The people working here were super nice ,4,2017-04-25
You have to come here  We had a couple of flank steak sandwiches  Very well seasoned  you can tell steak was marinated overnight  On great chibada bread with peppers and onions  Small place but they know what there doing ,5,2014-10-24
Having heard such great things about Gaucho Parrilla I had high expectations for the meal  That being said  the food was just good and well deserving of at least a four star rating  The problem I had with the whole experience was the setup of the whole restaurant  Not only was ordering annoying and made me feel like I was at a high class fast food joint  but the menu was extremely wordy  confusing  and the only way to view it was on a huge blackboard up front  It is also worth mentioning that with this setup you ll be stuck up front holding others back while trying to figure out what to order  If it s busy you will probably feel pressured to make a quick decision from a lengthy menu   Despite the annoyances up front I had no issues with service and the food was good enough to save Gaucho from a lacking experience  Besides burnt cut of toast  the steak  chicken  and chorizo that I ordered was done well and accompanied with some tasty sauces  I guess I can forgive Gaucho for it s annoying setup for a good meal  ,3,2017-11-22
Another non traditional restaurant  There s a very large menu on the wall when you enter and you re not seated until after you ve ordered and paid  Yes  it was weird tipping before being served     The food was all very very good though especially El Chorizo  my personal favorite  The shrimp and churrasco were EXCELLENT also ,4,2017-05-05
I can t say enough wonderful things about this place  The food was absolutely delicious    The only  downside  was not knowing beforehand that it was BYOB  Other than that  perfection  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ,5,2018-09-08
Of course this place doesn t need any more positive reviews   but if certainly deserves them   Went here with friends for lunch on a cold Saturday  had to wait outside for about    minutes but it was worth it   We love brunch so brought in bottles of champagne and orange juice and mixed up our own mimosas while we were there   I got the Argentino salad and I highly recommend adding shrimp to it     The staff was all very helpful and friendly and I will definitely be returning   Good to know   you can order ahead so that you don t have to wait in the potentially out the door line      brunchsohard,5,2016-02-29
It s       right  The experience with a restaurant begins when you look online  Outdated menu  no menu  shitty website   your anticipation drops  Restaurants  if we have to wait for approval on email reservation  requests   forget about it  This seems comparatively more common in Pittsburgh than DC  Baltimore   Use opentable or have a person answering the phone   My first minute with Gaucho       Look up ph  on yelp    Phone rings   times  get a real person      GAUCHO    What are your hours           We ll be by later   Ok  Byob BROTHER    I m already smiling about my meal  Haven t seen the place yet  That s how it s done   Roll in to the    seat spot and the smoky fire hits your nose immediately  You salivate  Your eyes drift across the orange paint and sparse yet rustic decorations that give off the gaucho vibe  The wood is stacked high  Orders are placed at the register where friendly service awaits with recommendations and attention   Food takes a while  the scent teasing you  The oily chorizo app arrived with sandwiches  should have come first  That s about all I can complain about  The chorizo is salty and awesome  if needing some grain mustard though the accompanying toast cuts it  The skirt steak sandwich  got talked out of the ribeye  was INTENSE  Delicious char  perfect temps and medium rare without request  The house chimi drips onto your plate alongside the healthy dose of onions and peppers  which are all pro except lightly soft  The bread borders the crunch soft levels perfectly    Seriously  best steak sandwich in Pittsburgh  Maybe ever ,5,2014-01-11
Tried yesterday a hanger steak and a sandwich  and this place is now in the top in Pittsburgh  Come early because this is pretty packed  Good meat  BYOB  what else can you ask for ,5,2015-01-25
Seriously   Why I don t go here weekly is insane   I ve only been here once and I completely understand why it is so highly rated  The food is some of the best I ve ever had   My flank steak was cooked to perfection  Heck  the smoked toast was even the best toast I have ever had   Try and go at an off time  because the line wraps around the door   I will be sure to come back here quite a bit ,5,2016-02-29
The smell outside of this place is enough to make you want to come inside and wait  as long as it takes  and place an order of your own  I should stress the need for patience in here  Lunch time the place is slammed  The menu is very extensive  It s a unique place to have in Pittsburgh  I do think it s a bit way over hyped  in most cases overpriced  I would recommend that someone try the samplers they offer so that you are better able to get an good idea of the offerings  As a fairly well travelled person  I find that it s simply incredibly hard to reproduce any ethnic offering outside of the originating country  Can I say that  The meats are just a bit high on the sodium count   this was my personal experience  I d go back for sure  but not often  I particularly liked the Brussel sprouts with bacon topped over them but it was for sure fairly NaCl ed  Good thing is the byob  too  Make sure you bring lots  You may need it not only for the reasons mentioned  but also to help drown out the noise levels  No one said it would be quiet ,3,2015-12-30
Great sandwiches   The second we walked in  we knew we were in for a great experience   We had the salmon  carne and pollo   The grill on the sourdough bread is fantastic ,5,2018-05-24
So good    Just got takeout  the grilled skirt steak and vegetables were incredible    Looking forward to future visits and trying more of the menu ,5,2013-12-29
This place is probably one of THE MOST delicious restaurants I ve ever had the pleasure of patroning  A M A Z I N G  I will definitely be back on my next trip to the Burgh ,5,2017-05-13
So good   I don t think you can go wrong with the menu  That said  it s a little overwhelming to read it all and make a quick choice so I d recommend browsing the menu ahead of time on their website to you have an idea of what you want  They have a great system  as far as ordering  seating  service  They were knowledgeable and accommodating to a severe gluten allergy in our group   I got one of the empanadas of the day  chicken  scallion  and lime if I remember correctly   which was awesome  The spicy chorizo with peppers and the fire grilled toast was equally delicious   They have   signature dipping sauces you can help yourself to  Each one is unique and it was fun to try new flavors with every bite   Plan to go back to try more of the menu  first visit did not disappoint ,5,2017-04-15
Like a previous reviewer  I too put off trying Gaucho for fear of not having any vegan options  Turns out there are at least three on the menu  no modifications necessary  It tastes as great as it smells  Very helpful and very sweet staff  Amazing sauces  too  Will return ,5,2014-02-28
We showed up at the perfect time          am on a Saturday just before the lines started to form   The food that was served is as good as the hype that surrounds this restaurant   We shared orders of the pork and caramelized onions  Broccolini  grits  steak sandwich  and pollo sandwich  The food came out hot  fast  and it was very good   I would definitely go back   I thought the prices were reasonable given the amount of food we were given ,5,2018-03-03
I ve never loved a lunch more than my lunch at Gaucho  So my suggestion to you is that you should go with a group of people and just order one of everything because everything was so amazing  Chicken empanadas  yes  Shrimp with rosemary  YES get     Steak  yup  Salad  even that was remarkably delicious  Melted cheese on grilled bread  get      What I m trying to say is that there is nothing on the menu here that could possibly be bad  If I could give it extra stars  I would  And I ve eaten a lot of food in my day    If you re in Pittsburgh  please make it a point to stop here for a meal  I hear there are lines out the door though so maybe plan to go for late afternoon snacking ,5,2016-04-20
Meat  Delicious  delicious  juicy meat  Shared a couple of the sandwiches with a friend  bread to meat ratio on point  and I got a corn on the side  I would totally come here every day if I could    Service was also fantastic   my friend brought her dog and the dog got a bone half the size of her ,5,2015-08-27
Don t be discouraged by the line around the block  that s a good sign  Probably one of the best restaurants in the city  I brought an out of town friend here a few months ago and when he came back recently  he specifically requested dinner here again   I did the regular menu for my first one or or two visits  but last week a group of us were offered the chance to skip the line and do the prix fixe menu downstairs in their private events room   Great decision  definitely more expensive  but fun for a change   The servers were really knowledgeable and personable and seemed concerned with us having a good experience  I ll be back ,5,2016-06-27
Wow  Just WOW  This place is amazing  I got the ribeye sandwich and corn on the cob  It melted in my mouth  The meat was cooked perfectly  We got there    minutes after it opened and there was all ready a line  By       the line was out the door ,5,2015-08-06
Gaucho is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh  I am not speaking in hyperbole  I ve been to almost all of the trendy restaurants in the city   i e  Eleven  butcher and the rye  salt  soba  etc   and I would pick Gaucho each and every time  When I leave this great city I will come back to visit friends and gaucho  Try the steak sandwich with skirt or flank steak and some empanadas ,5,2015-01-03
Been twice now  Always during lunch  Heard it was an insane wait if you went on a weekend night  Everyone is super nice  Food is DELICIOUS  Not a lot of seating ,5,2018-07-14
Best food in Pittsburgh  Went with a group of   and each one of us left so full  The steak burger was awesome  The only negative is the wait but that s because of the high demand  well worth the wait ,5,2016-01-07
Want to know how to cook steak  Take a lesson from these guys  The steak sandwich here was excellent  I loved the chimichurri sauce  the bread  the whole thing  Only complaint is it could have been a bit bigger OR less expensive  Also  I wish there were things on the menu in general that were more lunch prices than dinner prices  For non red meat eaters  they also serve a tilapia sandwich  I went back one day to try and get more of that delicious beef in my mouth  but alas though the place was supposed to be open  I  along with other surprised customers  found it closed  It s a pretty serious pet peeve of mine  going somewhere and thinking it will be open but it s not  It s pretty unprofessional  yet many places here do it  I am sure there were reasons etc  and I didn t starve to death since Vietnam s Pho is nearby and a pork sandwich there is half the price and also good  I just went there  But just a note to businesses  your customers notice when you are not open during your regular hours ,4,2014-01-17
This place is amazing    We were at pittsburgh for a conference and found this place on yelp with     rating  It is absolutely one of the best restaurants i have ever tried  I had the flank steak and it was great   ,5,2014-09-17
There are enough reviews here that I don t need to get too lengthy  The food is amazing here  Just go  You won t regret it ,5,2015-06-12
Service is a bit autistic  But the sandwiches are amazing  The wait is always stupid long but that s part of it I guess ,4,2016-07-20
Wow  Phenomenal place and truly worth the wait  I had a small Lomo   oz filet mignon  and the Calabaza Asada  roasted acorn squash  pickled cranberries  arugula  and spiced pecans   Both were delicious  The Lomo came with two crispy slices of this amazing bread that you could dip in four sauces as well as a nice side salad  But about that filet   it was absolutely incredible  The steak was so tender and the flavor had thoroughly been marinated into the meat  And the Calabaza Asada was nice too   the acorn squash formed this lovely bowl for the arugula salad  The smokiness of the pecans and the acidity of the cranberries provided the perfect complements to the sweet squash  The restaurant was packed to the door  and for a reason  I was very happy with my experience here ,5,2015-12-20
Any place that calls vegetables and other green stuff grass  has to be fun  When I walked in I thought this is an gimmicky type place  You know I don t like Chucky cheese you don t go there for the food  However  everything I happened to have Will bring me back when I m back in Pittsburgh   I enjoyed the lamb cooked medium rare with some grass  LOL I also had a beefy empanada that I think was prepared right before they brought it to me and was not sitting in the back waiting to be warmed up  It was crispy on the outside yummy  juicy and delicious on the inside  Accompanied with the choice of sauces that they have this place is phenomenal   I did enjoy the fun atmosphere  That also is why it only has four stars  A bit strange for the cost of the food  The quality of the food is definitely worth the price even with the strange set up ,4,2016-08-12
Fantastic  The ribeye was juicy and flavorful   The bread was soaked in steak drippings  But in a good way  I would go back in a heartbeat  Could eat that sandwich weekly  Great experience ,5,2016-05-11
Great people  delicious food  and cool vibes  Also  you must try every sauce they have out in the mason jars  Get there early because the line ends up out the door ,5,2016-10-30
There was a line out the door when we arrived but the folks in front of us had already been and  said it was worth the wait  After about an hour and a half  we finally got to order  The food was so good it actually erased all memory of the wait  Everything was fresh and made with with care  The waitstaff is super friendly and the vibe is perfect ,5,2015-12-30
Food was exceptional  Super fresh  We loved the strip steak  braised beef sandwich  chirazzo sausage and brussel sprouts  We also had a combo dish that included chicken  which was totally delicious  Staff was super friendly  Atmosphere is great  Tip  Get there at   am for an early lunch to beat the long lines that wrap around the building ,5,2015-12-30
Group we were with wanted to go  so thought we would give it another shot  Prices are way too high and the food quality is still mediocre  This time though our food was accompanied by a side of fruit flies  We told the waiter who said they would tell the manager  which did not help our situation but hopefully they get that addressed ,1,2015-12-01
On a recent business trip I purposely stayed close to Gaucho rather than closer to my meetings downtown   It was worth the walk in the snow  ice floes drifting down the river  The chanchito is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had anywhere     Also  there were two burly men who had literally driven from Ohio to eat here  and while they were they were calling their friends telling them to do the same     Ridiculous   Yes   That is  until you ve eaten their food   ,5,2015-02-16
Made a day trip to Pittsburg with the family  Checked yelp and trip advisor for places to eat and Guacho s was on the top of the list  And rightfully so I must say  So many positive things about Guacho s      The super friendly service from all the staff  We probably spoke with   or   different staff members throughout our time there  and they were all so friendly  We were afraid that we might be forgotten because we were the obly ones sitting outside  but in fact it seemed almost as if we were getting very personalized service      They are dog friendly  Seriously  major   for that  We had to sit outside but it s all shaded and even on this    degree day  it was very comfortable     Finally  the food  drooooool  For   for us  pup included   we ordered the asado platter    different types of meat      oz and   pieces of their delicious bread   the argentino salad and the mussles clams  My husband is very particular about food  especially his meats  and he absolutely loved it  My mom and I loved the salad  it had super fresh ingredients ans the grilled vegetables in it were so tasty    The only downfall would be the wait  as it always seems as if there is one  But it was well worth it  We went around      pm hoping to beat the dinner rush  Waited around    minutes to get to the front of the line and then another    minutes for our food    We re unfortunately not locals but would definitely go out of our way for another visit to Guacho s ,5,2017-06-17
Lost a star due to the setup  You walk in  get in line  sometimes out the door   order at a counter  then have to find free for all seating while your meal is prepared  Pretty annoying set up when it s crowded  Would have   stars if it was traditional restaurant service   Menu could also be more descriptive  One of my party thought they were getting some kind of fries and we got something more like potato salad   Aside from that  everything was fantastic  Got the lamb and it was cooked pretty rare  which they warn you about and which I was okay with  but it had a nice char and amazing flavor  Other people I was with both got the ribeye option  which was also fantastic  and had a fantastic char  providing the right amount of crisp   A nice little touch was the side dipping sauces they provide  There s a garlicy softrito style sauce that s out of this world ,4,2015-09-24
My short lived journey throughout Pittsburgh led me to Gaucho  Ironically  I walked past the location earlier in the day and returned after circling through the Steel City  I heard the lines would be long  so I called to see if I could place a carryout order  It was my lucky day because they allowed me today do so  Now  picture me walking past     people as I head to the entrance  I m sure more than half thought I was cutting the line  I picked up my order and overheard a few comments   He s smart for carrying out    good idea   and  that smells good   Momma always said that I was special  I proved her right that day    The food  I ordered   empanadas    beef    chicken  If you want to know what heaven is like  order from Gaucho  using the carryout option  of course   Your stomach  and mother  will be proud of you ,5,2018-03-22
My friend and I were coming back from West Virginia from his residency interview and we decided to stop by Pittsburgh to see the sights and grab food on the way back to NY    We found this cozy little Argentinian grub hub  We were immediately greeted by the staff and one girl promptly came to help us decipher the menu choices    I had the chanchito sandwich  cuz I love arugula  and my pal had the carne  choice meat was rib eye  sandwich    It came promptly and my my  it was delicious  Pork was tender  right amount of tangy from the pickles onion and bitter from the arugula  I inhaled my sandwich    My friend thought his beef over seasoned and both meat and bread was a bit burned  He did enjoy it tho    T was a nice visit to Pittsburgh  def recommendation  Surrounded by nice chill spots on the Strip  Too bad we had to leave early  Beautiful city  black and yellow painted all over ,4,2014-11-10
Hell yes    This place is amazing every single time   The line is a little bit annoying but I guess that s because everyone else figured out how awesome this joint is too   Try to go there during off peak hours and you ll slip right in ,5,2018-01-28
Oh Gaucho grande  how I love thee     The new space is incredibly beautiful  Everything from the exposed brick  the space with wooden tables and chairs by open  wonderful windows and new chalkboard menu is incredible  It was day one of new Gaucho and the lines continually wound out the door  Still everything seemed to flow nicely  This was a happy  appreciative crowd   We worried we d be unable to find a spot to sit  but everything was perfectly timed so that we found a comfy  sunny spot in plenty of time  Don t be scared off by the lines  it s more than worth your small investment of time   The new expanded menu is great  The new veggie empanadas were just amazing   We had the veggie and fish con pane and our favorite papas   The sauces were  as always  super tasty and the old butcher block serving station was a welcoming site to see after the hiatus  Everything was Scrumptious   We cannot wait to try the paella and see the soon to be opened expanded dining room ,5,2015-05-29
What s a Baltimore girl doing while shes driving   hours to get to Pittsburgh  She s dreaming about the amazing food she s going to get once she finally makes it to Gaucho  This is my first stop as soon as I get into the city  And it almost made me move there  The smell as soon as you get within a block is incredible  The firewood stacked along all the walls scream of authenticity  and the people who work there are so cool  I m a fan of the steak burger  and its been consistently good  Last time I had it with some bacon  and the bacon was way overcooked to the point of being charcoal  I would say to stick to veggie toppings on the burger  but it wasn t egregous enough for me to knock off a star  and I m sure that if I had said something they would have fixed it immediately  A word of caution  it does get hot inside  Great for the winter  not as fun in the summer ,5,2014-09-20
Phenomenally delicious meat   BYOB  So  so  so good   If you re looking for a burger   def get the steak burger  So good  Any meat of the grill will not disappoint  The seasoning are on point  This place gets crazy lines on the weekend  but you should be able to snatch a table on a weekday evening if you get lucky  The place is small but does open up around backs and has a hipster ish ambiance   You order at the counter and then take a seat  if available   Tons of great chimichurri sauces are available for dipping  I had the carrots with goat cheese for a side and they were surprisingly delicious and recommended to share   If you re arriving  just be aware for the potential for long lines and no potentially no place to sit  The food though  Worth it ,5,2017-05-16
While visiting the Strip District a few weeks ago  I stopped in for lunch at Gaucho on a whim  It turned out to be the best decision I made that day  It s a small place  it can hold       people max   and it s easy to miss if you re walking by   The first thing you notice when you walk in is the aroma from the grill  your mouth is already watering before you sit down  I ordered the carne sandwich with ribeye  which comes topped with grilled peppers   onions and chimmichurri sauce  The meat was well seasoned and cooked perfectly   juicy and tender  with a really nice char  I washed it down with a cold Mexican Coke  It s not the cheapest sandwich you ll find  ringing in at      but it s more than worth it  I came in hungry and left full   Besides the food itself  what really made my visit great was the excellent service  The owner of the place was super friendly and very patient  explaining the various items on the menu  They also did all the little things that take customer service from just good to exceptional  For example  one customer walked in and placed a      order to go  Gaucho gives a     discount if you call ahead with your takeout order  pro tip   but they went ahead gave him the discount anyway and helped him walk his  order out to his car in the snowy conditions  That is how you do customer service ,5,2014-01-04
Definitely one of our favorite restaurant of Pittsburgh  Good meal  good price and good service  The only problem is the long lines on Saturdays  so it s better get very early or after      p m on Weekends    ,5,2016-10-02
Fantastic and authentic Argentinian food with a unique and urban atmosphere  Hands down one of my favorite places in the city ,5,2018-04-18
Absolutely fabulous place    I travel an hour  plus willingly stand on line    Every time  It s delicious  family friendly  and great service  A must place to visit in Pittsburgh ,5,2016-05-22
How can people be so friendly     Haha  Everyone who worked there was cheery and welcoming  The food was yummy and unique too ,5,2016-07-10
The food is pretty good   no doubt   but the menu is pretty limited if you don t eat beef   pork like me  There are plenty of beef options so if your only restriction is pork  you ll find that the selection is pretty good    More than the actual dishes  what I absolutely love here are the three sauces that are offered  My favorite one  hands down  is the chimichurri sauce  it s green   It s amazing and I  fill up multiple sauce cups of it because it is amazing with the lamb    The line on weekends is usually out the door and I don t think they take reservations  To avoid the lines  I tend to go at awkward times like     pm before the dinner rush starts  The first time I went  we waited for     hours outside and then an additional   hour for food but we went on a Friday night  I believe  The subsequent times  I went at around     pm and there was no wait or line    Overall  a great place ,4,2018-05-24
I have been to Gaucho several times  and it s definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh  I would recommend it to anyone visiting the area for the first time   I love getting the steak sandwiches  but honestly anything is good here  As a side I would recommend the potatoes  One of the best parts of the Gaucho experience is the self serve sauces they have  When I go with friends we usually have a good time talking about which is our favorite  I maintain that the ajo garlic one is the best    Sometimes when I m extra hungry I even get some toast to eat with the sauce  but a sandwich or any other entree is usually more than enough  Prepare by going with an empty stomach   Just one note of caution  lines can get very long  I have waited in a line for around   hours to get in on a Friday or Saturday night  If you want to get in quick I would recommend going for lunch on a weekday  but there still might be a bit of a line  It does go pretty quick though  On a similar note  they don t take reservations and their system is that they seat you after you order at the counter ,5,2018-01-17
My friend took the guy she was seeing at the time and said it had awesome food and was BYOB  Its hard to tell if the food is good because my friend is a vegan but she was completely right about Gaucho  The sandwiches are amazing and big  We had arrived there around      on a Saturday and most of the food was sold out  especially the bread   We had ordered the chorizo which was unlike any chorizo I had ever tried  It was suppose to come with bread but because they wanted to save the bread for sandwiches  so no bread  But we had also ordered a steak sandwich and grilled corn  The corn was amazing  Sweet  char grilled  So good  The steak sandwich was good too and with the added sauces that they have out  One  if not the best steak sandwich  I can t wait to go back  I also love the smell driving past Gaucho  If that aroma doesn t get you  there s something wrong with you  Hahaha ,5,2014-08-09
Just as good  Definitely crowded on a Saturday afternoon  I got in at       and had to wait in line to order but when I left the line was out the door and around the corner    I need to remember to get my steak medium  I usually get medium well but I was served well done    This time around I tried the wings which were very good  the potatoes which were overly seasoned probably wouldn t get again  and the grilled corn which was so good    There sauces are amazing and found out that you can purchase them to take home  I m going to use that on everything ,5,2016-07-03
I really can t say it any better than all of those before me have  its just hands down amazing  Simple food cooked perfectly  seasoned perfectly  and served in a fun environment  I kind of hate myself for not coming sooner   Go with the sampler Parrillada Mixta  a sampler of chicken  steak  and chorizo served with olive oil soaked grilled bread  Its great for splitting with two people  Make sure you get all of the sauces so you can mix and match flavors ,5,2013-10-16
Everyone said this was THE place to try  Come early  especially for lunch and dinner  Otherwise  be prepared to wait in line for       minutes  And yes  that line goes outside and around the side of the building  rain or shine or snow and bitter cold  They take debit credit cards    Food  We had the lamb  a NY strip steak  and a ribeye  All the meats were prepared to the requested level of doneness  Lamb has a bit too much salt for my liking  but otherwise fresh and flavorful  Good char on all the meat  No one in our party of three cared for the charred bread accompanying the meats  Salads that came with each meat were lightly dressed in a vinaigrette  Empanadas were amazing  The pork empanada was our fave  Sides of cauliflower  broccolini  and green beans were simple and tasty    Service  You line up and order from the main counter  There is NO TABLE service  Drinks first  then food  Staff are proficient in explaining what s on the menu  which is a massive chalkboard on a wall as you enter  Based on your time in line  you should have plenty of time to review what s on the menu  Specials are posted lower on smaller individual chalkboards near the front of the line    Cost  A small lamb   oz  ribeye  and  oz  NY strip steak with side salads    pc  shrimp appetizer  sides of cauliflower  green beans  and broccolini  with a pork empanada and a chicken empanada ran us about     after tax  Not cheap and portions are so so    Overall  I wouldn t line up for it again  but it s worth a try  They do have a sign for the last group to be seated to hold noting they are the end of the line  This is so more folks don t wait in line in case they run out of food ,4,2018-04-22
I have only been here once  it was an hour and a half wait in line for lunch  but it was amazing   So good  And the atmosphere was excellent  Going back for sure   TK,4,2017-05-20
The aroma that emerges from the restaurant is so tantalizing that i would stop by for a second meal  I ve been to Gaucho several times  and by far I d say the best part of their meals is the sauces  However  they can seem a bit heavy  so use with discretion  Food can be seasoned better  I feel that it is a hit or miss or perhaps all the seasoning went on one end of the meat  and I didn t get any of it   but when I do it tastes terrific  Lastly  I ve consistently been getting overcooked steak  but thankfully their sauces make it much better ,3,2018-03-02
Steak sandwich is ridiculously good  seasonal sides are amazing   only downside here is the line  but also totally worth it,5,2018-07-04
We went for a private party and  oh my god  it was fantastic  I will definitely be going back  The sauces and vegetables and desserts were truly outstanding and the meat was perfect  Really great restaurant  Highly recommend ,5,2017-07-14
This is definitely top   restaurant in Pittsburgh for food  Their grilled meat  especially steak is absolutely amazing  The only gripe I have is that it is almost impossible to get a seat there  Every time I drive by there is a huge line  No reservations   no No Wait app     only option is to stand in line  I just don t want to wait in line for     hours for a restaurant  I just had their food truck  Asado   and it was amazing as well  Great lamb sandwich  Top   for sure  but who knows when I will be able to enjoy it again ,5,2017-08-06
Well  I had high hopes based on all the hype  Arrived today and waited for quite awhile in line  Staff was friendly and place looked nice with the new addition  Food didn t live up to the hype though  Sandwiches were ok  I liked the roll bread  It was fresh and tasty  The steak was ok  not as good as I hoped  Or at least not as good as all the reviews would lead you to believe  I liked the sauces however they offered  The empanadas were not good at all  Skip them  bland and just not worth it  Corn on the cob was good and potatoes were ok  All in all I felt it was expensive for what we received  Soft drinks were a bargain however at    with free refills  All in all it was decent but just didn t live up to the hype for me  I would not make it a priority to come back and would select other places over this ,3,2015-06-13
Okay yelpsters failed me  Im trying to figure out why this place has     stars  The place is a cool hipster place  staff was extremely friendly  however  this place is flawed in a few but major ways  First of all  the menu is this HUGE  mural  written on the wall in chalk  I think this menu is a little extensive to be written on a chalk wall and luckily it wasnt crowded or we would have felt super rushed trying to figure out what we wanted in line  Secondly  I personally dont think ordering filet mignon at a counter and waiting on your food to arrive is acceptable  It felt so weird ordering    dollars worth of food and going to sit down to wait for your order to arrive  At least they actually brought it to us I guess  But dont expect to get asked if you need anything  Its self service after that  And lastly the food was good but not bragging good in my opinion    I CAN say that the filet would have been amazing had it actually been cooked to medium well as we requsted  One of them was definitely on the lower end of the medium spectrum and the other one was closer to medium well but not quite  Since the steak was sliced already  and topped with chimichurri  I didnt want to send it back but clearly was not medium well and I think cooks should be able to recognize this before sending it out  especially with it being sliced already  Flaws aside  this goes in the book as one of the most tender  juicy  and most flavorful pieces of filet mignon I ve ever eaten and Ive eaten a lot of filet mignon in my lifetime  The chimmichurri paired very well with it  It complimented it unlike a lot of places that serve chimi as a necessity to cover up lack of flavor    I also had two beef empanadas  The cashier told me that the beef wasnt  just shredded beef and it was pulsed through a blender so I was expecting a  picadillo style  filling but made with pulsed beef instead of ground beef for a more gourmet filling  however  I was disappointed to find it filled with dry  long chunky pieces of shredded beef  There were a couple of olives mixed in but the beef empanada didnt make the cut at all in my  book  It was very dry inside   And lastly  the proveleta  This was very good  Ive never had anything like it before but it is a thick slice of provolone cheese  seasoned with herbs and fried on each side leaving a delicious crisp on the outside and chewy goodness through the middle  It is served on grilled toast  I ate it with the chilled grilled vegetable medley that came with my steak plate to make  bruschetta  and it was very good that way    Overall  this place has some decent eats but not good enough to write back home about  Obviously im in the minority with this opinion so I guess this is one of those try it yourself places    you might love it ,3,2016-07-23
Omnomnom  The empanadas were the best  especially with the pimenton sauce  roasted red pepper with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and other stuff     poured into each bite  My boyfriend got the steak sandwich with the ride year and loved it  His dad got the steak burger and loved it too  The sauces are all amazing  try all of them  There s also grilled veggies that are yummy for the vegetarians  or health conscious    There are only   seats or so inside  but when we went it wasn t crowded so it wasn t a problem  There s tables outside for the summer    The owner is a long time restaurateur who finally decided to settle down and cook his family s native cuisine  And I  for one  am appreciative that he did ,5,2013-11-29
Came here for dinner last night for a friend s birthday  We wanted to come on a week night since the weekends are crazy packed  We got there around   and there was a little line  We waited in like for about    minutes  While we were in line a lady came around and asked how many people were in our party so that we could be seated once we ordered  I thought that was a nice touch  I ordered the small flank steak plate and an order of maiz  corn on the cob   Everything was delicious  My steak was tender and juicy    i got mine medium rare   The chimichurri they put on the steak is amazing  They have four sauces  a chimichurri  a garlic sauce  a Smokey pepper sauce and a carmelized onion sauce  All four were so good but the chimi and garlic are my favorite  This place is also BYOB with no corkage fee  This place is worth the visit ,5,2018-08-02
i have nothing to complain about for this place  the people are very welcoming and they have a system that works great  the menu is filled with delicious options for everyone and i walked out feeling stuffed after only one sandwich  i recommend the carne sandwich but add an egg  the chimichurri is also tasty and adds a lot to the sandwich  i wouldn t recommend if you are planning on coming with a party of more than   people ,5,2018-02-20
Great Argentinian food for a fair price  This is a fast casual type of place so you order at the counter  they seat you  and then they bring out your food  Everything we had was very good  though the highlight was probably their   homemade sauces that you can put on everything   a chimichurri sauce  a carmelized onion sauce  a smoked pepper sauce  and a garlic sauce  They have sandwiches  salads  plates of meat  empanadas  and sides of veggies  I don t think you can really go wrong but I recommend some type of steak and something with bread so that you can dip it in all the sauces ,5,2017-07-05
I am in love with Gaucho   I have to get the Rosemary Braised Beef sandwich every time I go  Please never take it off the menu   Nothing should stop you from sampling this sweet deliciousness  The reviews speak for themselves ,5,2017-08-28
Gaucho is a tiny spot with big  BIG smoky flavor   Walking in is like being immersed in a forest fire that all of Bambi s delicious friends have failed to escape   Me and my brother went here for his birthday dinner  and the first thing that struck us  aside from the size and the smoke  is the minimalist staff  one guy on the register  one guy in the kitchen   But both of them are seriously good at what they do   The guy up front was warm  funny  and knowledgeable  providing atypically excellent service while the guy in the back works the grill like a friggin artist   Here s the breakdown of our meal   We ordered three sandwiches  the skirt steak  the fish of the day  mako shark   and the steak burger   The skirt steak was cooked astonishingly well   Generally when SLABS of steak and not those paper thin slices are used in a sandwich  it doesn t eat well  doesn t break apart nicely when you bite into it so the sandwich falls apart or you end up pulling out more meat than you intended   The steak at Gaucho eats well  and is wonderfully tender   Our only complaint was that the steak itself was a bit underseasoned and was overpowered by the caramelized onions and red peppers   The mako shark was also cooked perfectly and seasoned very well  tasting lightly of lemon but still recognizable as shark   If you ve been disappointed by tough or bland shark in the past  I definitely recommend trying Gaucho s take on it   Finally  the steakburger was the smokiest burger I ve had in Pittsburgh  and in terms of sheer carnivorous sublimity ranks up there with the best   The smoke complimented the flavor of the meat perfectly  giving it depth and nuance that all the toppings in the world could not   Of course all of these sandwiches were served on delicious bread that held up to the juices dripping out of the proteins     All in all  these sandwiches are pricy  but they are damn well worth it   The executions are excellent and the flavors are generally well balanced   I d also recommend trying the four condiments they have available  with my personal favorites being the chimmi and the ajo   I have to say  existence of this place gives me much hope   Here is truly good food and good cooking without pretense  striking a balance  and a striking balance  between artistry and accessibility ,5,2014-02-03
YES  It is worth standing outside in the line  This is the absolute best meal I have had in Pittsburgh   Rosemary braised beef sandwich Empanadas  Sweet potatoes Papas  AMAZING ,5,2016-03-27
Not sure what else can be said about this place   The burger I just had was excellent and rivals anything in Pittsburgh  The meat had a twinge of wood smokiness that was balanced great with caramelized onions  arugula  and chimichurri   You pick your extras   The sweet potatoes were out of this world and I will now seek to replicate them  The service is something I would liken to a bee hive  organized chaos   The prices are more than fair     stars ,5,2017-04-05
Great steak and great sandwich  You can smell the grill upon entering the restaurant  First time I had a great fish sandwich  All the herbs are fresh too  The staff is friendly  Not too much can be said since our experiences have always been great  Maybe they should stock up on corn so they don t run out when business is good ,5,2014-06-07
Amazing   The service  the food and the atmosphere were all top notch   Service was amazingly fast   My kids really liked it because the flavors are exceptional    Can t wait to grab a bottle of wine for a date night another night soon ,5,2018-03-10
This place is honestly overrated  The steak was tough to cut  and the sauces were too oily  The paella was so salty to the point where we could not eat it  It didn t have a lot of shrimp and mussels in it  either  Save your money and go somewhere else  It s not worth standing in a line for an hour for subpar food ,3,2018-04-19
Very good  Totally worth the wait  Also make sure you grab some of their sauces  they were awesome  We will definitely be returning ,5,2017-11-13
Slow and overpriced  The food was good but not outstanding  We waited in line an hour to find more than half the tables were empty inside  They need to improve efficiencies  I may try again with a takeout order but will never wait in that line again ,2,2019-08-07
Amazing food  Awesome staff  I stumbled by this place looking for something quick  cheap and get a sense of local fare  I smelled the food from outside and decided to check them out  Walked in and couldn t figure out the menu so I asked the girl behind the counter about the menu  She came from around the counter and explained everything to me and my family  and shared what was popular there  I loved that she took time to do that  The food wasn t cheap but everything sounded so good that we tried a few things  Lol  The steak sandwich was an experience of awesomeness  The shrimp was great  I wish I tried the corn  Do yourself and palate a favor and check them out ,5,2015-07-24
Not much new to say  as the overwhelmingly positive reviews are      accurate  the food is incredible  Everyone in Pittsburgh should try it if they haven t yet   That said  it appears that everyone in Pittsburgh IS trying to have it  so getting into the restaurant is roughly as hard as getting an unannounced table for eight at Noodlehead on a Saturday night  But the food is so incredible that I can t take a star off for the awful wait you will undoubtedly have  It s still worth it    Go early  go with a small crowd  and go hungry  You won t regret it ,5,2016-04-18
So good  we went twice on our visit   Bring your own wine   We shared the chicken  awesome   Their garlic sauce is off the hook  well  all of the sauces are   We also split a salad   Again  very well done   It s nice to see a restaurant where the staff works together ,5,2018-09-21
My favorite restaurant in the Burgh  Never disappoints the Flank steak sandwich is so delicious  On crunchy Ciabatta bread  the wood fire grilled flank steak cooked perfectly to medium  the char tastes so good  Topped with fire roasted peppers and onions  smothered in their choice of four fire roasted dipping sauces  especially their garlic aioli  A side of roasted red potatoes  roasted with rosemary and garlic  this food is soooooo good   A little dessert cookie with dulche le lecher rounds out a perfect meal again  Gaucho is the best ,5,2019-09-21
The food was very tasty  especially their s signature sauce  But there is one thing  it takes long time to wait at the outside  almost a hour  Everything was good except that ,4,2019-11-02
It s in the    s and bitter cold  Place is small so with the crowd it took    min just to get inside  It was an hour to order  at the counter   be seated and served  It was worth the wait  I had a ribeye  sliced with chimichurri   fantastic  Potatoes with roasted garlic  very nice  And such a welcome surprise in flavor was the spaghetti squash with smoked honey and pecans  As we were eating the line waiting outside to get in was getting longer  It is worth the wait ,5,2018-11-10
I spent a few days in Pittsburgh over the holidays and G P A  was on my must visit list  My husband and I went for an early lunch and only had to wait       minutes  The staff were very friendly  You order food and drinks  soft drinks only as it s a BYOB  at the counter where you pay and the staff seat you and bring your food out  Our food arrived swiftly once we were seated and I think part of the reason that you wait at the counter is so that the kitchen doesn t get swamped with orders  G P A  isn t fine dining   its a casual lunch dinner option with a friendly  relaxed atmosphere  I was surprised to find that the tables were spacious and well spaced out and I appreciated that they didn t rush us or pressure us to leave even though they were busy  The food was very good  simply prepared and very flavorful  We shared a mixed grill of sausage  chicken and flank steak which came with some grilled country style bread along with a house salad and two empanadas  this made for a hearty lunch that was satisfying and extremely reasonably priced   The empanadas had soft tender pastry and tasty fillings  the meats were well cooked and juicy and the house salad made a nice fresh accompaniment  we had a small salad and it was plenty enough for two people   The meats came with chimmichurri and in addition there were large jars of it around the restaurant that you could help yourself to  we tried four different sorts and they were all amazing and complimented everything well   We only had time for one visit  but I can t wait to visit again on my next Pittsburgh trip ,5,2017-12-27
One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh  But forewarning  if you re going on Friday Saturday night be prepared for long lines out the door  You wait in line to order and then are seated  where the food is brought to you  Well worth the wait though  I ve been there a few times and love the skirt steak and chicken sandwiches  The meat is always so tender and the sauces that come with     wow  Healthy  fresh  and oh so flavorful  A must eat in Pittsburgh  ,5,2018-09-01
They have a party room downstairs which provided the perfect setting to celebrate a friend co worker s birthday   Food was delicious  space was warm and inviting and allowed us all to mingle   The staff was extremely attentive   I would go back in a heartbeat ,5,2016-04-02
It s not the first time I visit an Argentinian restaurant  I was excited hearing this place since it had amazing reviews  I was extremely disappointed    It was a long wait to order food which would have been fine if the food was cooked properly  We ordered the Parrillada Mixta  steak  chicken and chorizo   One word to describe the food would be  DRY  The steak was chewy  I ordered medium rare and it came well done   the chorizo was rubbery and the chicken well flavored with the garlic sauce was also dry    We also ordered the Arrechera platter  flank steak   I ordered it medium and it came out burnt  I had to cut all the outside  so I didn t  have to taste the bitterness  On the positive side  the salad was delicious and fresh  The Chorypan was good  Extremely overrated place  or the kitchen had a bad day ,2,2015-08-16
The price is a little bit high but they cook other meat to perfection  Their sauces are amazing  Honestly everything here is really great and I really recommend it for everyone to come here  All my friends who have visited here loved it and would not stop talking about it  If you have a large party I would suggest getting a seafood paella,5,2018-05-07
  out of   stars    Ok maybe the fact that i was starving when we got there on our road trip past Pittsburgh contributed a half star but nevertheless one of most memorable restaurants I ve been to  My wife a I shared the Parrillada Mixata that included a choice of steak  we tried NY   spicy chorizo  bbq chicken and toasts  We also tried the chicken and beef empenadas  Everything was amazing  The portions were generous and enough for the two of us  The sauces couldn t be any better  Specially the smoked pepper sauce  The service was great and the staff were super friendly and attentive  We were lucky that we got there a bit early for dinner but there was a huge line for dinner by the time we left  The prices were also very reasonable  Overall i wanna go back to Pittsburgh just to go to Gaucho Parrilla Argentina    Food      Service and atmosphere      Price       Overall     ,5,2016-10-23
Ridiculously good   Worth the wait  be patient   Chorizo is so good   As I the roasted cauliflower   Of course the steak and chicken is perfect  The   sauces are so good it s hard not to sample while waiting   The staff is very good and friendly   They do keep the line slow  but only to ensure everyone gets a seat   Worth every second ,5,2017-10-22
Amazing     Food is so good and fresh  And it s byob  I wouldn t go when your extremely hungry because when we got there at around  ish for dinner we waited in line for an hour  To me  I think the line is worth it for how good the food is  But I love good food ,5,2019-04-18
Great service  incredible food and very experienced staff  You can t find this anywhere else in Pittsburgh ,5,2014-08-08
I have been there a couple of times and had a steak sandwich  It is better as a lunch place than dinner   Make sure to get something to,5,2018-01-11
Had only   day in Pittsburgh and ate here for dinner  Steak was excellent  salad was perfect  but bread was super burnt  My meal was      Line took an hour at       Staff was nice  We ate outside and it was cute but loud from nearby club  BYOB is an awesome thing that I wish I had been prepared for    I ll have to go back someday with a bottle of Malbec ,4,2018-08-26
WOWOWOWOWOWWWW  I LOVEEEE their menu selections  TBH  taste is like a       but their sauces  ambiance and service kick it up to      Came at    AM and there was already a decent line wrapped around the building  Fear not though  they are speedy and efficient   Basically  you choose your protein and can top it on a salad  small or large   sandwich or just on a platter  There are obviously lots of other protein options too    but I LOVE MY COW    Everything was well prepared  I definitely don t have enough experience with the menu yet to advice people of what to get  but if you ever have questions about what you should get  ask the cashier  He is hella nice    Parking  busy area  Almost like a Chinatown Farmers Market area on weekends  Street it    Overall  a must try if you are in PA  A pretty solid spot for brunch and dinner  Come early before they run out ,5,2017-05-10
This place is the legit  real deal delicious sandwich place   This is a place that you go out of your way to visit    I had a matambre sandwich   The meat was smoky  delicious and well seasoned   The bread was great too    Definitely coming back to this jewel ,5,2014-01-26
Good food  Meat is greta with a lot of variety  Sometimes the char is too much   Get there early before the line goes out the door and up the bridge ,4,2017-01-14
Amazing  I could tell from the smoke billowing outside that this meal was going to be good  but it surpassed my expectations   I had a steak sandwich  and it was fantastic  They have unique condiments in a table in the middle   I liked the chimichurri the most  But the meat was so good it didn t even need it ,5,2013-03-15
Hands down the best place to eat in Pittsburgh  Just the sauces alone are enough to give   stars for  I have been known to eat the Chimichurri sauce by itself while waiting for my food  The wait is well worth it  The wood fire flavor is out of this world and it seeps into every food that they serve  The roasted veggies are to die for and a must to order as a side  The steak sandwich is a classic and so filling  I can hardly ever finish the whole thing but still order sides because I just can t resist    Finally  the star of the show  THE PAELLA  I lived in Spain for some time and it s the closest I ve experienced in the states to authentic paella  It s cooked in the traditional cast iron skillet so it gets that charred  crunchy rice at the bottom that I have bene missing  Truly worth it    And the price just can t be beat  For such an outstanding  renown and acclaimed restaurant  it astounds me that they haven t raised their prices  I myself can eat there  and feel like I don t need to eat for days  for      And for a group of four adults  we got an order of steak  that came with a side salad and grilled bread   four pieces of corn  an order of the veggies  an order of the wings and the     paella and our entire bill came to just      And we had leftovers  It was fantastic  Plus  the fact that it s BYOB makes it even better    The only set back is that you can t sit and bask in the glory of your food coma because there are so many people waiting for a table  But it s honestly part of the experience    Just remember to tip the staff too  They work so hard and the service is great  Just because it s not your typical sit down service doesn t mean they shouldn t get some cash thrown into the tip jar at the register  The whole staff  including the kitchen  shares the tips  and that s always been something I ve appreciated in an establishment ,5,2016-09-28
As a vegetarian  I was hesitant to come here  To my surprise they had a few options  I got the veg sandwich and it was so good  My other non veg friends got steak  and said it was delicious ,5,2018-03-31
Drove through Pittsburgh from NYC to Memphis  Looked up on yelp the best rated place that would be open  in the area and     This amazing little gem was the only one with   stars and it definitively deserved it s   stars  Nice staff  super good and charming environment ,5,2014-08-09
What an experience   The food was incredible   we ordered all   choices of empanadas  flank steak  and   sides   everything had a ton of flavor and was cooked perfectly  There was a huge line but the manager was very accommodating especially because we had a baby with us  Easy   stars,5,2018-07-06
The food here is UNREAL    Absolutely delicious meats  My only grievance is that you can t sit down until you order  and there is usually a very lengthy line  so you end up standing for about an hour before you eat and then feel a little rushed as you eat what you ve been waiting for ,5,2018-04-15
Always have a good experience here  The employees are always excitable and kind  Food is always delicious  I love the flank steak  shrimp  toast  and the dipping oils ,5,2016-08-28
This spot is all that   some  I wasn t too fond of my chicken empanada  but my sister said her veggie one was good  Their favors are so delicious ,5,2015-07-31
Eat here     It s amazing  Great for a fun night out to wear a cute outfit for sure but you can totally go there wearing and feeling whatever  It s perfect  Food is amazing  Style is unique  I dig it ,5,2016-05-12
If you love meat simply the best  Take a bottle of wine  or a   pack  and enjoy   While we have loved the Asado platter on many occasions  the steak burger is simply delectable  Take out is also a possibility  Worth the wait  which wraps around onto the   th St bridge and not Penn Ave  FYI   ,5,2018-03-25
Great good great personality  Would go back anytime and I strongly recommend this place for a great meal,5,2014-01-29
The food is all that it s cracked up to be   Not only is everything cooked to perfection  the spice combinations are new  to most of us  and delicious   It s a little like the experience of the first time you dive into Indian food   The service is also super friendly and helpful   Very reasonable prices for what you get   The only thing not to like is the weird order  wait  sit  set up that has to be learned   It doesn t ruin the experience  but it would be so much more relaxing to be seated and then order   I hate seat insecurity  it s something that goes back to the high school cafeteria   You know it s not ideal when there are signs warning you to relax before you enter   BTW  that s not a problem if you want take out ,5,2017-09-02
Huge line on Saturday night  We waited    minutes outside on the street before stepping in to order  I had a ribeye sandwich and she had a pork platter  The ribeye was juicy  but tough and not trimmed of the gristle and silver skin  Huge sandwich on ciabatta bread with roasted peppers and chimichurri sauce  Difficult to hold and eat  The pork platter was shredded and was served with grilled onions and a salad  The meal was ok  but not worth    minutes in the cold with the exhaust from the broiler blowing all over us  Maybe better on a warm evening and different menu selections   The staff looked like they had gotten off from their day jobs at Trader Joe s and come straight to the restaurant  A lot of colorful hair  piercings and ink  ,3,2016-03-20
A terribly easy five stars to give    I got the ribeye steak plate  It s an immaculate piece of perfectly cooked steak  thinly sliced on the bias  and served on a wooden board with a small side salad and a piece of flawlessly grilled bread    The steak was incredible  The bread was very purposefully included to soak up the insanely good juices that run from the steak as you eat it  and the salad is a wonderful fresh accompaniment    We also tried a side of humita which is described as  Corn pudding w onions   fresh herbs   This was fantastic and added a nice contrast to the meal    The only thing I didn t enjoy was the empanada  and my fellow diner agreed  The texture of the pastry was off and the filling tasted a bit funny    But I still refuse  boldly refuse even  to give this place   stars  because the steak was so gut punchingly good that if I found myself within     miles of Pittsburgh at any point in time  I would drive out of my way to enjoy another meal at Gaucho    Good thing we came in when we did  cause the line snaked inside the restaurant as we were eating  It was actually hard to leave    not just because people were blocking the door    but because I wanted more steak    and to live there    inside the restaurant ,5,2016-08-10
Not impressed at all  Tried their steak sandwich  and found the meat to be hard and dry  It was very hard to chew  Also tried their sauces  and I would say I am not impressed  Food wise I would just give it a threr star    Probably reading the previous reviews set my expectations too high and I don t find it live up to the hype  Also rather pricey  The long wait makes this place overall   star for me ,2,2018-04-19
With all of the   star reviews I guess I was expecting more  It was very confusing as soon as we walked in  One sign says wait to be seated and another sign says don t stand here  With no hostess in sight we were left trying to read the huge black board menu  At least half of it is in another language  Finally some from behind the counter filling water glasses gave us the scoop  This is actually like a fast food restaurant  You have to pick your drinks  order your food  and then find yourself a table  Now we realize there isn t any silverware or plates  you have to get them yourself too  I had the ribeye which was good but it was over cooked to med well when I ordered med  The salad that came with  it was served actually on top of the steak and was drenched in some oily dressing  Terrible  I guess that was something else nobody told us about  and we forgot to ask with all of the confusion  You can t pick your own salad dressing  Next time I ll pick an american themed restaurant ,2,2017-02-17
I have eaten only twice here but both meals made it to my top meals ever in Pittsburgh  I have eaten sandwiches  empanadas  chicken wings  and the alfareho cookies amongst other things  There was not a single thing I didn t like  The food is packed with rich deep Flavors  the meat is unbelievably juicy  soft and tender  The only problem is waiting in the long line after searching for a parking spot ,5,2016-02-03
I went there on a Saturday at   pm  and the wait was about an hour and half to get in  However it was certainly worth it  as this restaurant serves some amazing food  I had the spicy sausage sandwich and a chicken empanada  I would highly recommend both of those options for they were delicious  and I was able to eat the whole meal considering the hunger I built up waiting in line    I was told there is no line around      and      on weekdays if you have the chance to go then ,5,2017-07-31
The food was great   the line   wait for ordering  not so much   Terribly thought out flow of queuing  ordering   seating  that makes the wait far longer than it needs to be   We have to grab our own silverware  etc   which is kinda silly   Having said that  the food was excellent  and worth a try   I d suggest a weeknight to help avoid the unnecessary line   wait ,4,2017-08-06
On a warm summer Thursday afternoon  I did a self directed gastronomic tour of Lawrenceville and The Strip   Gaucho was recommended over and over  even by other restaurants and bars  I was warned that there was going to be a huge line  so I was glad that I went at     pm and was able to get right in  The huge chalkboard menu to the right of the counter lists all their features  which is a true reflection of an Argentinian parilla  Chicken  pork  beef  shrimp  all go on the grill with herbaceous and flavorful sauces  I ordered the spicy chorizo  shrimp  and empanadas  and everything I had was delicious  They are BYOB and the staff is more than happy to help you navigate the South American menu  Jars of self serve sauces featuring chimichurri  roasted tomato  roasted garlic  and roasted onion sauces are openly available and pair great with   well  a spoon  they are that good ,4,2018-08-21
Busy  eccentric place in the Strip  A must try to everyone living or visiting Pittsburgh  Everything we ve tried was awesome  Be willing to wait outside when you go  but that s part of the fun      Can t wait to go again  Oh and they do take out too ,5,2017-09-16
All of the other reviews have this place covered   It is incredible   Been here many times and I am always impressed by the food   steaks cooked to perfection and extremely fresh ingredients   Very reasonably priced   not cheap  but not overpriced either   Nominee for favorite restaurant in PGH   Love the   star food without the stuffy environment   Always bring out of towners here as it is sure to be a hit ,5,2018-03-19
I was really looking forward to this place since we recently moved from Philly and would love a good sandwich   We ordered the sandwich with filet  side of potatoes and the side of rice   The staff was really friendly and helpful    I wish the sauces had a description written down on the menu or somewhere so you know what s in them   They were all full of flavor  The flavors in the sandwich were really good   The onion  meat and bread together tasted great   The meat was seasoned and cooked well   The wood flavor is really enjoyable   What I didn t like was that the sandwich was hard to eat because the meat was hard to eat   If they sliced the meat thinner it would be easier to eat  Overall  good sandwich but meat is hard to eat   Great staff ,4,2014-08-19
There isn t much else to add that has not already been said     BYOB  great food  and prices   One of the ladies working here encouraged us to take home some extra sauce to accompany our breakfast  sammiches  etc  Excellent peeps here   Warm and modern environment without being pretentious  Well done   Update  So far I ve had three of Gaucho s sandwiches  the Bondiola  pork shoulder   carne  I had flank steak   and rosemary braised beef  The Bondiola is my favorite of the lot   For around     for a delicious sammich and potatoes  I think you would be hard pressed to find a better deal in Pittsburgh for the skrilla ,5,2016-02-08
Delicious  A place I would take people to explore when they visit Pittsburgh ,5,2015-10-27
Great meats  cooked to perfection  Long wait  but service is friendly and they try to get it to you as soon as possible   Get the meat sampler  it is amazing ,5,2017-11-09
This store is completely evacuated  Don t know where it is moving into  Really miss the good food there ,5,2015-05-16
It s definitely a great place but not deserve   stars rating  I ordered fish of the day plate and it was very salty  The NY strip plate was good but not much special  If it wouldn t take me   minutes to wait in line  I ll give   stars ,3,2015-09-20
Being new to Pittsburgh I have slowly been trying new places and was invited to enjoy Sat night dinner here  So to start off the place is busy on Sat night first come first serve no reservations expect a line but it s popular so it s expected The are a lot of choices from steaks  sandwiches  seafood paella  and appetizers  We got the paella with a side of beef empanadas and some ribs which were all good  The place is BYOB which is a plus  I will have to return again some time and try a steak to give it a full review but it was good  The place for the record is young and youthfull with music playing and isn t by far a quiet romantic place  It s all part of great food and great service ,4,2017-04-16
Worked in fine dining for   years and this may have been my most euphoric food experience yet  Part of   of us we each tried each other and every thing was absolutely to die for  Smoked pulled pork sandwich with caramelized onions and mustard was fantastic  Other person got sweet sausage sand witch and sausage had a very unique twist in the flavor that worked in perfect harmony with rest of flavors  I got the Ribeye medium with side salad  by far best ribeye I ve ever tasted  They aced the medium temp on their wood fire grill   Even side salad was very tasty and prices aren t too bad    of us was roughly     and that included a tip  This is the rare kind of place where every last menu item will completely knock your socks off  Can t wait to return ,5,2016-12-09
Two words  Smoked Meats  Get there  this place is amazing ,5,2016-03-01
Amazing food and awesome people  I recommend their streak burger  The meat is incredible here ,5,2015-08-22
Great food  Be prepared to wait  in a line,5,2016-08-11
Damn     This place is awesome  Best bang for your buck in the city of Pittsburgh  Never had a bad meal and I LOVE the MEAT SWEATS this place give you  The sauces are impeccable  Everything is amazing ,5,2017-12-20
Gaucho is beyond awesome  The meat is high quality product  over the top well prepared  The staff is enthusiastic about what they do  The whole experience is like going to a good friend s house  discovering that some of your other friends have also come over  and then being served implausibly good food ,5,2014-06-19
A bit pricey for the amount of food you get  I heard lots of great things about it  but it didn t live up to the hype in my opinion ,3,2016-06-28
SETTING Very small place with very limited bar stools along the wall for dining in  Menu is written on blackboards that stretch along the walls  More seating outside  Wood everywhere   FOOD We ordered the top two recommended sandwiches  Ribeye sandwich  medium rare  unless you tell them otherwise  and the Rosemary braised beef sandwich   Wow  the ribeye was perfection  Definitely a heavy sandwich with thick cuts of ribeye topped with roasted red peppers and onions on a ciabatta type bread  The rosemary braised beef sandwich was delicious as well  a little lighter than the ribeye  but still filling  The horseradish sauce went very well with the beef and caramelized onions    The four kinds of sauces they offer were excellent  Definitely try dipping your sandwiches in them for an extra kick   SERVICE Despite the long lines  the food was made in a reasonable amount of time  To make the line more bearable  there was always loud and silly banter amongst the cooks and register  It was as if I was at an improv show  One customer was taking a photo and the cooks immediately struck a pose  Another was hugging his girlfriend  and the cooks joked out loud to their customers that he was actually  holding her up from falling down  due to the long wait  Hilarious  Order up front and they call your name once your order is ready   IMPRESSIONS There aren t many places that serve such quality meat inside a sandwich at a reasonable price  Each meal comes with a side of laughs as well  Everyone there is happy and leaves with his stomach happy  this is why Gaucho s is a must visit   just be prepared to wait at least    minutes ,5,2015-04-04
Great food and friendly staff  I recommend coming a little earlier than when you want to eat as the wait is a bit and there is no reservation mechanism  Once you ve order though food comes out quick  Definitely recommend ,5,2018-04-29
Service was awesome  Food arrived to the table fast  We ordered a BUNCH of different stuff and shared  It was all delicious  A bit pricey       tip for    but well worth it,5,2016-09-27
What can I say about this place that hasn t already been said  Not much I m guessing   The meats are flavorful and have a great char  The bread is fresh and toasted  My favorite part are the grilled veggies  I would come here just for them  The sauces are flavorful  My favorite is the chimmi  I look forward to trying the empanadas and grilled corn next time  Yes the space is small but they are working on an expansion  If in the area this is a MUST try ,5,2015-03-12
If I could  I would live on a cross beam of the   th Street Bridge  so I could eat here    times a week   Great food  reasonably priced   Friendly staff   Parking can be a pain  I suspect   But my party got there early  about       AM and we missed the noon rush   I had one of the steak sandwiches  my pal had the pork   We also got a sample of the empanadas   We were very happy people    We did not want to leave   Ever    My pal called today   he went there without me and had the wings   He says they were fantastic   He now joins me in looking for a cross beam to declare residence near the restaurant ,5,2016-02-05
On a ling weekend from Chicago and found this place on yelp  The Carne sandwhich with ribeye cut  medium rare  was without question the best sandwhich I ve ever gotten  Roasted potatoes and empe adas were really good too  All   sauces offered were amazing  Cant say enough about the whole experience  Will definitely visit before leaving town and every time I m back  Definitely check it out ,5,2016-09-30
I highly recommend Gaucho  All of their selections are very high quality  and it s a reasonable price  I have tried the Rosemary beef and the veggies  and they were both great ,5,2015-04-11
Made a trip here from Cleveland this past weekend   First let me say that my wife is from Argentina  and I have visited there   The food here was better than any restaurant that I visited while in Buenos Aires   My wife loved it as well  although she said the empanadas were not as good as her mother makes   We both had different steaks which were cooked to perfection  Long lines  but they moved quickly and the food is definitely worth it   I only wish there was one in Cleveland ,5,2017-02-24
This place rocks   No alcohol  but byob   The food is out of this world   Argentine steaks grilled and sliced perfect   Huge Paella and grilled appetizers   Fed a group of   of us and so much fun ,5,2017-06-14
I could live without red meat  Chicken and fish  I need  but not red meat  So this review is partly mine and partly my devoted carnivore boyfriend s     The meat is really tender and seasoned really well  We ve had the lomo  filet  with chimichurri  the flank steak with some pepper sauce  and the lomo sandwich  They were all really good  The only issue for me is that the cooking temperatures are not very consistent  I ordered a dish of lomo and my boyfriend ordered a lomo sandwich and mine was medium rare and his was well done    maybe between medium well and well  He will eat any meat  but I am pretty strictly a medium to medium well person  so the medium rare was way too raw for me    He also usually gets a side order of the potatoes and I get the grilled bread  I love that grilled bread  I would install that grill in my home just so I could paint bread with olive oil and grill it like they do    The guys who work at Gaucho Parillla are total hipsters  but really friendly guys  We ve gone around closing before and they ve walked out  to smoke  chat  get some air   and said  don t steal anything while we re gone   and just walked out for a few minutes    Now  I just asked my boyfriend  what do you want me to say about the Gaucho place   as he has been urging me to write a review  He said  best meat ever  and  it s wonderful  and when I said  why    looking for more details   he said  psht  What do you mean why  You know why   So he s not very helpful  but definitely a fan  so take that as you will    Tip  It s BYOB and the nice guys cooking your meat would enjoy a beer from your   pack ,5,2014-02-18
Once you get past the extremely long wait  yummy food awaits you   I thought the food was tasty  especially the grilled vegetables but I thought the portions were kind of small overall   The small grilled vegetables was supposed to feed two as a side but I could have devoured that thing myself in addition to the small flank steak plate I ordered   If I ever visit Pittsburgh again  I would definitely like to come back and try the asado plate steak sampler ,4,2016-06-04
Oh man  the food here is so so so good  Like  just    oh man  The staff is great  the menu is on the wall  you come in  order and grab a table  I had a pork sandwich and some potatoes and something else  I ve forgotten  it s been a week   the person I was with got stake and some veggies and a bunch of other things  The empanadas are so good  I got some kind of cookie thing for desert  and my friend got a fruit crumble thing  Just  everything was so good  eat here  come hungry  it is so worth it ,5,2018-01-18
This is the  rd time here and it never disappoints  I m looking forward for my next visit  Amazing food and service    Meat lovers this is your heaven   Make sure to try the empanadas ,5,2018-09-19
This is one of the BEST restaurants in Pittsburgh  The food is awesome  The flavors and quality are what sets this place apart  I ve had several types of steak  All were excellent  Probably the best steak salad I ve ever had  Chicken is also excellent  Must try the homemade sauces  Service is good for a place where you order at a counter  But even with lines of customers out the door  service moves relatively quickly ,5,2015-07-08
We were walking by Gaucho and it smelled so good we knew we had to stop  Their was a small line but it was all worth the wait   We ordered the fugazza  the provoletta  chicken empanadas  the rosemary braised beef  the campfire yams and rice   The fugazza was good but you must love onions and rosemary  If not  it s not for you  The provoletta was tasty  The chicken empanadas were just ok  not super flavorful  The rosemary braised beef sandwich was delicious  The rice was plain and the campfire yams were sweet and delicious  they would even make a good dessert    If I lived in Pittsburgh I would definitely go back  The only thing that bugged me was you feel a little rushed while eating since they are trying to seat as many customers as quickly as they can ,4,2016-03-25
Love it  Food  fantastic  Even after expanding the restaurant the quality and taste remains  worth it  The service we had was better than   out of    of the best local restaurants in Pgh   You order at the counter and the staff helps find a seat for your party   There are no reservations and you are not seated by a hostess but these guys have it down  They serve your food make sure everything is cool and check in on you  If you want additional items they ll place the order for you vs having to stand in line again  Lucky to have in Pgh ,5,2016-01-04
I was just visiting a friend in the area and had no expectations about Gaucho   On a Saturday evening  we waited in line for a little more than an hour  maybe an hour and a half   The line moved quickly and everyone around us was friendly   The weather was great and this place is BYOB  so we busted out the cups of sangria while in line   Once inside  the two of us ordered a selection of things including the Zanahoria bebe  baby carrots   chorizos  provoletta  and the qui qui chicky   The qui qui chicky is amazing  I literally had a dream about it   The provoletta was also delicious   I don t remember for certain  but I think our total came to under     including tip   I would highly recommend ,5,2017-05-22
This was an amazing find in Pittsburgh  The most delish salad and topped with filet mignon  Everything looks delish here  Yummy veggies and proteins  Excellent service  And to top it off no cork fee  If your in the city it s a must ,5,2018-06-28
Had to line up by the door to order first  Even though there s plenty of seats inside but you can sit until you ordered and paid  We had Pork round shape  and Beef  dumpling shape  Empanadas  the beef one tasted better   medium cooked ribeye  tasted great but the meat did not seem very fresh   small Gaucho salad  and the featured pasta  Everything is amazing  The line went fast    mins for us on Friday noon   so don t be afraid of waiting too long ,5,2018-09-07
Absolutely our favorite place in Pittsburgh   I cannot say enough good things   the staff is fun  the food is amazing ,5,2016-11-09
Went for lunch on a Saturday and sat outside   The food is well done while the atmosphere is a bit frenetic   Grilled meats do not disappoint   BYOB is a plus as we brought a nice bottle of Malbec   It s a good place  but  as some contend  one of the best in town  not really   But would definitely recommend ,4,2015-08-19
After eating here today I now know why they are ranked    on America s top     by Yelp  I ordered the carne sandwich with a side of potatoes  both were very filling and the chimmi sauce really kicked it up a notch  It can be a little pricey  but it s definitely worth it  Between the extremely helpful service  cozy atmosphere  and great food  this is my new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh ,5,2015-07-08
Yelp led me here    THANK YOU   This has to be one of the BEST sandwiches I have ever had   You can smell the wood burning stove before you see the place  And it smells like heaven  They have a lovely little patio that uses their wood pile as a backdrop  Inside is small but the space is used wisely  It has minimal but special decor  There is a huge overwhelming  read you will want it all  chalkboard of choices   At the island in the middle are   sauces that pair with all of the food nicely   I am not sure what they are exactly  but each one was better than last    The girl at the register was very helpful and explained what things were and gave a helpful suggestion for a fist timer  I placed my order for the filet mignon  roasted red pepper  caramelized onion on ciabatta with a sauce    The owner manager brought it out and chatted with me a little about the concept and the space    He even  apologized  in advance for the cravings I would have   I thought we will see     He was not lying   I told my husband the next day I wanted to go again  It is that good      You will be very glad you tried it  I can t wait to go again  I want to try the roasted corn ,5,2014-07-19
Awesome  awesome  awesome  Everything here is done so well  I love the beef sandwiches  My wife talked me into getting a seafood stew and that was unreal  One of my favorite places on the strip for lunch or an early dinner ,5,2018-03-15
I m so upset it took me this long to get here  but I was always nervous about the long line   Luckily  when I went  there was no line at all   There s nothing but good things to say about the food   It s delicious and you get a lot of it   I was nervous that I was only getting a sandwich  so I also ordered the mushroom side  but I didn t need it   The sandwich would have been plenty    I can t wait to come back again and again ,5,2017-07-05
If your in the strip district  you need to go to this restaurant  It s an experience  You will wait but it s worth every minute  It s a BYOB and make sure you are hungry  We ordered the empanadas for the table as appetizers with some chorizo too  Perfect starters  Then we ordered the strip and omg is the only way to describe it  The chicken is delicious too  Sides of potatoes and root vegetables made a perfect combination    I will miss this place when my daughter graduates  Might have to make a special trip ,5,2017-11-01
Food is excellent  We have tried most items on their menu and everything is delicious  Meat is perfectly seasoned  Grill vegetable is tasty  Their waiting staff is very attentive    The only downside is the line can be very long and sometimes you need to wait for more than    minutes  people actually start drinking while waiting   They will not take your name and force you to actually stand in the line to dine here  which is extremely inefficient ,5,2018-02-26
If you see a long line in the strip across the street from Altar Bar  it s not because some major new band is playing in town  No  Altar Bar is back to being a church and it s Gaucho s notoriously long line to try their    authentic  wood fired Argentinian grilled meats  Like Smallman Galley  they don t accept any reservations  but they have a much smaller staff location  so the wait can be a bit daunting  especially if you re waiting in the mid day sun during the lunchtime rush  I recommend going during the mid afternoon lull on a weekday if you don t like waiting for potentially over an hour  Otherwise  be prepared to spend some time chatting with hungry strangers in the Strip  Once you finally get inside  make sure you try the their collection of self serve sauces which include chimichurri  roasted tomato  roasted garlic  roasted onion  etc ,5,2018-08-27
I think I am in the minority here  but I can t help but think this place is a bit overrated   Too much oil  too much fanfare  too little meat  too pricey for my liking   My qualms       Why have Flank and Skirt steak  Seems a bit redundant and the two times I have ordered the Asado plate I could not distinguish them  The Asado plate is also expensive and a bit of a let down      The Empanadas  Ugh  maybe I caught them on a bad day  I certainly hope so  It was dry  crusty and crumbled at the touch  I am a huge fan of meat pastries from every culinary persuasion and this was a surprising folly for a place so highly touted      The salads  Skip the Argentino with steak  Never had the heart for any of the others because this was just floating in oil   Overall  I still can t help but love this place  I can t  You don t find places like this in Pittsburgh and it is so refreshing to have the option for a  high end  steak sandwich in the strip  Still  I am just not into paying    bucks for lunch   in Pittsburgh   from anywhere   If the line is short and your pockets a little too heavy I would definitely recommend  Nice people too ,4,2014-03-25
If you re looking for a lively place with fun  flavorful dishes  Gaucho is for you  When you get inside  you need to wait until your whole party arrives before you can order  but you can pass the time by browsing the extensive menu on the board  The two times I ve been there  the wait was under    minutes  but most nights  people wait out the door  However  the wait is really worth it  The food has so much flavor and the sauces are really yummy    My first time there  I ordered the Qui Qui Chicky which is listed as a  small plate   but you get   pieces of chicken so it s forsure big enough for a meal  The next time I was there  I got the   oz flank steak plate  The steak was very tender and grilled perfectly  Both meals pair very well with any of the sauces  Also  there is a paella that I haven t gotten but I feel is worth it if you re in a large group of    people   Gaucho is great  and I m only giving it   stars instead of   because I also had their empanadas which I heard really good reviews about  but I don t think they re anything to write home about ,4,2018-08-12
I lived in Denver for   years before moving to the burgh and so I was spoiled with all the fast casual restaurants to choose from  Pittsburgh REALLY needs more of these kinds of restaurants  My husband and I have been to Gauchos a few times now and have loved it every time  We enjoy just ordering our food at the counter  getting everything we need  eating amazing high quality food and leave at our leisure  Perfect when you have small kids  The food is top notch every time  We take our families here when they visit  It s in our top   places to eat in Pittsburgh  There is no negative things we have experienced with this place   the only down side that parking is street and paid ,5,2017-06-03
Aaaammmmaaazing  I can t express how awesome this place is  I have the rosemary braised beef sandwich with empanadas and papas  I want to bring this place back to ny with me  Best sandwich I have ever had ,5,2013-12-07
This is probably my favorite place to eat  I had a small filet and it was delicious  The sauces are so good  Grilled corn and cauliflower was superb  Will go back and wait in line because it s just plain worth it  Friendly staff  Clean  Love love love this place ,5,2018-05-19
Kind of disappointed at this place  Came herefor my birthday and I felt like there wasn t a lot of flavor   spices in any of the dishes except the empanadas and steak was great  On the other hand the sauce area just looked like a mess  flies were surrounded it and it just looked unappealing to try ,3,2017-10-18
Everything was amazing  I ordered the Flank Steak Plate  chicken empanada  and the grilled vegetables  The flank steak had a perfect crust that married so well with the chimichurri and other sauces  So very tender and delicious  That being said  my favorite part was the grilled vegetables  They were absolutely stellar  I put the grilled onions and peppers on the olive oil soaked bred and then rubbed it with the chimichurri  So so good  The empanada was nice but not the star  It went well with the pimenton sauce    I d come back to Pittsburgh for this ,5,2015-06-29
Dined here about   months ago  the owner personally came up and said hello to us   Fun atmosphere delicious sandwiches   Great service and atmosphere vibrant fun place ,4,2015-01-25
I ve been here twice now  Great food every time  Everything I have tried has been awesome  I am not a huge fan of the line style ordering but the place is cool and has cool decor  I will be back ,5,2016-02-12
I think that Gaucho might be my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh  which is a little strange  even though their new space is about      larger than their old one  it s still not a comfortable place to sit   But the food is just  so good  that it doesn t matter  I will come back again and again     It s not fine dining  but my favorite thing on the menu is the steak sandwich made with ribeye steak   Nearly all of the food is cooked directly over their incomparable wood fired grill   The house made authentically Argentinian sauces complete the sandwich  so don t be shy and be sure to try them all   I can t decide if I like the pimenton  smoky red pepper  or ajo  garlic  better   If you d looking for a side dish  I can t recommend the grilled veggies enough   Who knew that something so simple could be so delicious   Also  I say skip the paella   It was fun to eat as a group  but it lacked so much in flavor   Arrive early or in the middle of the afternoon to beat the wait   BYOB ,5,2018-07-01
Definitely one of the best Restaurants in Pittsburgh  Quality is consistent  Also extremely friendly and eclectic staff  The boy with the pink hair was really cute and nice  Great place for lunch or to take the fam to in the early evening ,5,2017-01-15
One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh  While the wait may seem intimidating  it is always extremely worth it  The staff is friendly and always bring out the food in a timely manner  Can t wait to go again ,5,2018-09-03
This review isn t about the food  which is mostly excellent based on the two times that I ve been previously  I tried to go tonight for takeout and was told that I would have to wait in the long line for people actually sitting at the restaurant to order my food because I hadn t called ahead  It s beyond preposterous to make people wait all that time simply to order takeout  I ve never heard of this happening at other restaurants  On top of that the employee was brusque and even a little bit rude  I understand that places like this restaurant are really popular and as a result the staff often get overworked  but this policy doesn t make any sense  If you re going to prevent walk up customers from ordering takeout at the restaurant itself in a timely manner  then you shouldn t offer takeout any longer  And if your staff are overworked and having to stay late every night  as other posters have mentioned   maybe you should adjust the closing time accordingly ,1,2016-06-12
Visit Pittsburgh every two weeks or so for work and thought we d venture to the Strip    After the crazy long line and all the hype  left the restaurant somewhat disappointed    Stood in the line the meandered along the length of the building  on a narrow baking hot concrete sidewalk  directly abutting the tarmac street  Hostess wouldn t commit to how long of a wait  with a canned response for each who asked  Many rules to follow  explicitly stated along your route  aka  Seinfeld soup nazi   As you reach indoors  the highlight of the experience is a large lobby with views of attached kitchen and a large wall sized board describing a multitude of culinary options  Many varieties of steaks  poultry and fish options  Helpful diagrams of how they cook their meats  Views of the kitchen as you order your food in the cafeteria line is entertaining  Very friendly cashiers  Wait for them to seat you    Entering the dining area a bit of a letdown  Nondescript smallish and visually isolated back room that feels half basic coffee shop   half small town airport fast food sit down  Mix of recycled    s and    s office tables and chairs with seemingly little thought put into the room  The procession up to and including ordering is obviously the focus    Had the   oz filet mignon       with a roasted potato side       Steak was sliced  decent but not spectacular  with a roasted garlic salad side   Various dipping sauces  Finished with a tart and coffee for dessert    As we left  passing the others anxiously waiting to place their order  and seeing how quickly visitors cycle through once they get seated  I could tell you exactly how long of a wait to expect for a given line length  Enjoyable experience  but for our group of    thinking not standing up to the hype ,3,2018-07-17
HOLY CRAP   This place is the place where food dreams come true   This place right now is hard to find as it is in the smallest little whole in the wall you ve ever seen that has zero seating and almost as much standing room but anyone who has tried this place would gladly stand and eat their food   So stopped in here on an afternoon for the first time and got the rosemary braised beef with horsey sauce and caramelized onion on a baguette   First off the bread  because anyone who knows me knows I m all about the bread  A baguette can get hard sometimes and the roof of my mouth feels the paid after a few bites but NOT here  The baguette was soft and not too bready and was the PERFECT accompaniment to the meat   Now onto the good stuff   Walk anywhere within a miles distance of this place and the cooking meat will grab you by the nose  pick you up and drag you right into this restaurant where all your carnivore cravings will be satisfied   The meat here is sublime  Juicy  flavorful  and they PACK it on   I have never tasted braised beef like this in my life  and I m not really sure I will ever again which makes me sad   This place is amazing  I cannot tell you enough just how amazing this place is   If you are a local or a tourist like myself  get in here  grab a sammie and fall in love with your food  You will not regret it ,5,2015-03-25
Since I enter this place I really like it  Gaucho is a small restaurant with really polite and warm people  The food is just amazing  one of the best I have tried in Pittsburgh  The meat is juicy and so soft  I truly recommended  The corn is just  barbecued perfectly ,5,2014-05-28
Wow  Great place   We both had burgers and loved them    Sat out on the porch and enjoyed the patio   Absolutely will be back ,5,2018-05-08
I love the steak here  I have no idea how they keep the prices so reasonable  I went here for a loved one s anniversary and it was absolutely amazing  I love that I can order without sides and not waste anything  The sauces are all mind blowing  A new favorite for me  Meaty ,5,2015-12-21
The best Rosemary beef sandwich in the whole city  Just a heads up you going to be ready to wait in line for at least half an hour no matter what time of the day it is,5,2018-01-21
Delicious food  great atmosphere  and wonderful owner staff  There is usually a line out the door but they are very efficient in getting people in and out  It s definitely worth waiting in the line ,5,2016-10-26
The line extended out the doorway and wrapped around the side of the restaurant and it always will unless you go on a off hour  Then the line will only extend out the threshold    I waited an hour and didn t regret a thing  This was one of the best meals I ve had in Pittsburgh and have gone twice since  Their rosemary braised beef so juicy and tender but I enjoyed the pollo more  The pollo has everything I love  mushrooms  onions  chicken  and most importantly   potatoes    Tip  Always  always  always get their gaucho papas and dip it into every sauce that they offer ,5,2015-10-08
The food is absolutely amazing  Be sure to try any of the BBQ  and get plenty of sides to try everything  Each ingredient is so well thought through and executed perfectly  I ve also ate from their food truck which was just as fantastic  The only reason I gave   stars is because of the set up of the restaurant  You have to wait so long in line  which usually goes out the door  I prefer the traditional restaurant seating of being able to sit first and then order from the menu  so you don t have to wait upwards of an hour in a cramped line  It is still worth it to taste this wonderful Argentinian food ,4,2018-04-17
Heard great things but was average in my opinion  Unique but price was expensive for what I got,3,2015-08-26
Delicious   They give great suggestions if you re feeling overwhelmed by their menu   The meat is perfectly cooked and all of the dips and sauces are delectable  Lunch for   costs around     and there unfortunately aren t many seats unless it s nice outside  then they have patio   Highly recommended    Word on the street is that they re beginning work on the seating  That can t come soon enough  ,5,2015-02-02
I fell in love with this place   Sarah was our server and she was fast and fantastic  She recommended a few items that we all ordered and shared     The grilled shrimp   can t remember the name of it   was the best thing I ve ever tasted   I usually don t care too much about shrimp  but this we amazing   When I go back I ll be ordering it   We the group of us ordered about    things and shared   All of us had different favorites   Along with the shrimp  my favorites were the grilled vegetables and Papa s potatoes   Others loved the potato salad  corn pudding   A couple ordered sandwiches that they found to be their favorites   I also had a small chopped salad that was perfectly dressed   it was lovely  but I loved the others more   Try it   I plan to bring my son there to try the shrimp   Be prepared though  it s not a sit and order place   When you walk in your arrived to a giant chalkboard of their menu   You order at the counter and then sit down   Tips are collected in a jar at the register and are shared throughout the staff ,5,2015-10-14
delicious steak  cool  casual atmosphere  long lines but when you re standig in them with friends  they go by fast ,5,2017-04-25
Genuinely amazing food at a decent price  I had the steak sandwich  skirt steak  sweet potato   empanadas  The sandwich  steak   potato were absolutely to die for  I ve been thinking about the food for days since leaving  Would skip the empanadas next time  not that they were bad but they were just good and I d rather leave food for the excellent meat and sides  Great ambiance  Can t wait to go back soon ,5,2017-04-03
Gaucho s legendary status is well earned  when it comes to sandwiches  there is Gaucho and there is everyone else    Perfection is their filet sandwich  expertly grilled filet complemented with smoky  slightly charred vegetables  all piled onto lightly toasted bread that s sturdy enough to hold everything together yet delicate enough to let the ingredients shine  An array of available sauces creates an impossible  delicious dilemma  the only rational solution is having some of each    This is the sandwich of my dreams ,5,2015-02-21
Quality beef  fresh bread  and vegetables you can actually taste  when was the last time you could say that about a bell pepper    A word to the wise  seating is quite limited  so until the restaurant finishes expanding  it s perfect for takeout during busy times   Now  stop reading this review and start gorging ,5,2015-02-19
I absolutely love this place  Given its popularity  the lines can get long during peak hours but I can assure you it is totally worth it    I ve had the cordero  lamb  which comes with a crostini  side salad  and some sort of pickled mustard seed spread  I ve also had the pollo a la parilla  half roasted chicken  which I really loved the even though it didn t come with any sides  But the chicken was cooked so perfectly that it didn t matter that it didn t have any sides  The empanadas have always been really good too  My favorite ones are the veggie  Both times I went  they did not have the chicken wings which I have been told is a must try    This place can get expensive depending on what you order  The lamb was     while the chicken was      I liked the chicken a lot better   Even though it s really busy and crowded  the service has always been great ,5,2016-12-27
First off  the trick with Gaucho is to order in advance  then skip the wait  walk and grab your food  and then hustle down to whatever apartment you call home and enjoy the delish  On my second night in Pittsburgh  my dad and I walked the   th St  bridge after unpacking and proceeded to wait in line for just under two hours  After about an hour  we noticed that people were able to walk in  skip the line  and grab pre ordered food to go and we looked at each other solemnly   I have eaten at many good restaurants in some wonderful and underappreciated cities in my time  None of them  including Gaucho  is worth a two hour wait in line  Would I wait    minutes  Yes  The food IS good  but at some point the waiting time supersedes quality food  To be fair  the service staff and cooks do a great job of pushing the line and balancing between encouraging finished diners to depart while also giving you good service   Regarding the food  it is very good like I said  The sandwiches are underwhelming though and need to be complimented with any of the wonderful sides  Personally  if I want some meat  I go with the wings now  They are sizeable  perfectly grilled  and have a delightful zest to them with fairly complex flavors  They are quite nice   Many people love the grilled vegetables  but as someone who grills veggies at home with regularity  I don t see much difference  I do recommend the Papas Dulce and Fungos though    The sauces are good  but again  waiting in line for two hours to order something you drench in sauce seems a bit unusual  Your mileage may vary though ,4,2016-11-30
Upon reading the other reviews  we headed straight here   No way could a place be this good   we said  Our minds are blown  This place is fantastic  When in doubt  stick to simple meat dishes which is what they do best  we had carne sandwich with filet mignon  empanadas and mushroom appetizer   Simplicity and beauty  This place is a must ,5,2014-08-13
One of my favorite places  takes effort to not eat here everyday  I don t know if this can be beat  GET THE CORN AND THE GAUCHO PAPAS  Hanger is probably my favorite  but it s hard to go wrong    With apologies to Gaucho I would recommend a fattier cut of meat than the filet simply because of how outstanding the flavors are on all of the dishes and sauces  Filet stands well alone and while fantastic the flavors feel less impressive on that cut   You can not go wrong here though  Get creative and push your boundaries  you are in excellent hands at Gaucho   Finally  try the rosemary short rib sandwich at least once  before you lay down for the dirt nap   The line looks more daunting than it really is  Once you order and pay  your food is typically out within    minutes  at most   compared to conventional restaurant where you wait at your table ,5,2016-01-06
Wow  they have great steaks  Gaucho is a must try restaurant in Pittsburgh    There is a great variety of meal choices here listed on the front wall  Most of them are priced well  I suggest you try one of the empanadas  which are all unique and flavorful  The side of charred bread is so good    Please keep in mind that there is usually a long wait that wraps around the outside of Gaucho s front door  Dress warm in the winter months  It s worth the wait ,5,2017-12-10
Hands down best food in pittsburgh   Fresh and high quality ingredients  I got the Argentino salad with a side of toast  Must try the chimmichurri sauce ,5,2015-02-01
Rosemary braised beef or ribeye Sammie  No need for talk  just go now and thank me later,5,2015-07-24
Wow is this place as great as everyone says   I need to figure out a way to eat at this place more often   ,5,2015-10-01
The food at Gaucho is well worth the wait in line  We had the steak sampler  can t remember what it s called   the paella and empanadas  all were outstanding  both in taste and presentation ,5,2018-04-24
Wow  That s all we could say after dinner at Gaucho Parrilla Argentina  It is WONDERFUL  We went on a Friday directly after work  got there about       and there was no line so we stood there and chatted with the guy manning the counter and the guys in the back added their two cents as well  I order the chicken sandwich and it was amazing  I am so glad this places as popped up  It s a must try for anyone in Pittsburgh ,5,2013-04-09
Always a line out the door  Super popular joint  Call ahead for takeout  The food is worth the wait ,5,2017-11-28
If you like delicious food  Gaucho is an absolute must try  I live in the Strip District and drive past Gaucho daily and the wonderful smells that come out of this place are hard to resist  so I don t  The last time I went  I ordered the Carne  a fantastic steak sandwich with your choice of steak  marinated and grilled peppers and onions  served on a fresh bun that s doused with some delicious oil butter garlic combo  It was heavenly  The prices here are extremely reasonable and it s BYOB  so it s well worth the long wait in line that wraps outside the building that you will probably encounter  ours was    minutes on a very cold day   So bring your booze and someone fun to talk to in line and enjoy your experience at Gaucho  ,5,2017-05-09
fantastico    great food and great service at very reasonable prices   Had empanadas  Arrechera steak  baked yam with marshmallows and honey  saffron rice    wish I had known that this is a BYOB place ,5,2016-03-30
my son loves this place tasty food good service and very clean   ,4,2016-02-22
I really wish I d tried Gaucho when I worked just across the street  It s not as convenient any more  but we ll definitely be back  I suggest going early  so the line it s too bad  You get a lot of food  so it s better to eat early anyway    The line moves very slowly  but everyone is so friendly  so it doesn t seem as long as it would be without the friendly atmosphere  As I d heard from many friends  the food at Gaucho is WELL worth the wait  It s delicious and they are BYOB with no corking fee  so you can take your own beer or wine to enjoy with the wonderful food ,5,2016-10-07
WOW    The food and service were amazing    We were in Pittsburg for the Society for Applied Anthropology Conference   found it on Yelp and the rest is history    The food was so so so good    The sauces were fabulous and I feel like we just made great friends in the staff    I ve been to Argentina and nothing there could compare to this    I just wish they were in California    However next time my son and his girlfriend come to Pittsburgh to visit her family I m placing my order    ,5,2015-03-26
Good meat  I m still not sure if it worths the wait  something that makes me not want to go back but the food was great ,5,2019-02-03
Ate here on a trip to Pittsburgh for work   The service was great  food was even better   Only minus for me was that they don t sell any alcohol   You walk in and stand in line in front of their huge menu on a chalk board   You order your drinks first  then the next step in line is ordering your food   Someone else will ask how many people in your party and then go ready a table   I had the large ribeye  medium rare with a side of the roasted red potatoes   My friend had the steak sandwich   Both got to our table quickly and were cooked how we ordered them   The salad that came with my steak was terrific  as were the potatoes   The ribeye was seasoned nicely and sliced  and had two toasted slices of bread laid in top   The whole thing was a great experience  helpful staff and great food     I will add that I found it amusing that the  hipster   apologies for lack of a better term  appearing staff work at a steak house   In Seattle   twenty somethings that look like them would only serve vegan fair trade farm to table food that tastes awful ,5,2017-04-15
This is my first Argentina restaurant  and sure they didn t let me down  The receptionist are very nice  When I show him the picture that I want to eat  because I couldn t guessed what kinda meat would be like without a picture   even though the dish is not in their menu anymore he recommended me something very similar and even out some pickled onions to mimic the closest version  Incredible service  Will definitely go there again next time when I m in Pittsburg  I ordered qiqi chicken this time and I ll lamb or steak next time   ,5,2018-06-24
So I was in town for the weekend and stumbled on this       review on yelp and never tried Argentine food so figure I check it out  I read the previous reviews and it said that this place gets busy  I called ahead and they said it was a hour half wait  I went because people swear by this place  And the line was wrapped onto the street and it was pretty cold  I ended up waiting for about an hour half like she said  I ended up ordering the carne sandwich with rib eye medium rare with the peppers and caramelized onions  I gotta say it was a       It was good and it had this bomb red sauce on the side you could pair it with  They gave a generous portion  I couldn t even finish it  But the steak was cooked good  it was hard for me to cut my knife into the bread of the sandwich but overall it was okay  the hot cocoa bread pudding was a little of a let down          I love bread pudding but this didn t blow me away whatsoever  But overall I wasn t completely disappointed with the place  Staff there is super nice  And it s tight on seating too  I don t know if I d be back but I didn t think it was worth that long wait   I give this place a      overall ,4,2018-12-16
One of my favorite places to eat  Especially if you like beef ,5,2017-06-25
Absurdly great ribeye steak sandwich   This restaurant is sensational   Can I give   stars   Please ,5,2016-08-31
This is the story of a girl   A girl with a dream   A dream about steak   A week before I had a random Wednesday Thursday off  I decided that Thursday would be it   The day I finally made my way to Gaucho   Of course I ve heard the hype   Who in the Pittsburgh Yelpiverse hasn t   Clearly at this point Gaucho is well established   I didn t expect to be disappointed   The question was just how happy could a lunch at Gaucho make me   I knew I had to do my research   I drooled over the menu several times ahead of time trying to narrow down the choices so I wouldn t panic when I ordered   I read several of the hundreds of Yelp reviews looking to learn the ins and outs of how to order  at the counter  take a seat and wait for your name to be called   when to arrive  since it seems to always be busy  often with a line out the door   how the service was  friendly  and what people thought of the food itself  amazing      The night before I had attended a Yelp Elite event at a local brewery   I hit up three local breweries that day  it s kind of my thing  and came home with an IPA that I thought would pair well with the steak I was anticipating   And then the waiting      I planned to arrive at Gaucho when they first opened at   am   I scored rock star parking just in front of their location   I got out of my car and could immediately smell that wood fired grill  The outside patio was intriguing but it was a little muggy so I decided on dining inside   I went to the corner entry door  don t be fooled by the two other doors that are not entrances for patrons  and made my way inside   The inside is welcoming and the huge menu greets you as you approach the counter to place your order   I was the first to arrive  but only long enough to place my order and pick my seat   I kindly told the first girl who asked me if I wanted a drink that all I needed was a glass since I brought my own beer   She happily obliged and the girl next to her took my order   I went with the small skirt steak plate  medium   I took my seat in a corner table so I could watch the magic behind the scenes   I watched the efficient symphony of servers emerging from the kitchen  dancing through the dining room calling out names to deliver food to anticipating diners and clearing tables for incoming patrons while another employee transferred wood from the dining area to the grill in order to keep the fire going     My meal was delivered to me within    minutes and it was such a thing of beauty that it brought a tear to my eye   I almost didn t want to eat this work of art   Gaucho is simple but captivating with its presentation  in this case my medium skirt steak with chimmi  toast and salad   I took my time to savor every bite and every angle   I tried the   different sauces they had on the counter as well and liked them all  but found the meat did not need any extras   Good steak like this stands on its own     It might seem questionable as to why I only gave   stars   The overall experience of Gaucho is definitely not to be missed  don t get me wrong   But I think I would have been confused about how and what to order if I hadn t prepared myself ahead of time   I also think that despite the efficiency in service it can be disruptive when names are yelled out through the whole restaurant   I guess what this really means is I ll have to go back again and try something else to see if I can have an even better experience   Sigh   If I must ,4,2015-07-15
The only downside to Gaucho is that the wait can be quite long during peak times  However  the food is amazing  The sandwiches are very generous portions and delicious  I love the sauces that you are able to help yourself to and add flavor to the meal  The sides are also delicious  especially the potatoes ,5,2018-01-31
Amazing  I had steak but literally tasted everything from friends plates  You will not be disappointed  make sure to try all of the sauces ,5,2019-12-12
  trips thus far and this place has been very consistent  Wonderful food and selection  Long wait times to be seated  The steaks themselves have always been perfectly done  the one knock on the place is that you can definitely tell that you arent eating a premium steak  The quality of the meat just isnt the same as most higher end steakhouses  which they dont claim to be  Will continue to return whenever I visit Pitt ,4,2017-10-14
Ambiente agradable muy buena calidad en los alimentos presentaci n del personal muy bis,5,2019-10-08
Having salivated by Gaucho on several occasions  I had no choice but to walk in on Thursday afternoon when the ever present line was missing  I knew the cupboards were bare at home  and I wanted to bring the hubs something savory  Serious thanks to the nice young man at the counter   I told him I wanted  steak and potatoes  and he helped me translate that into a great to go order  I got the rib eye  but   per his suggestion   kept it rare  It reheated perfectly to a nice medium rare  The small red potatoes came with garlic and herbs  Delicious  And  there was a nice side salad  radishes  carrots  tomatoes  which I ate the next day  Seriously good food and a big shout out for being so nice to me about my initially non special order ,5,2017-03-10
If you find yourself anywhere near Pittsburg and crave mad flavor meat  Arrive here  An out of stater  next time I m bringing a cooler to stock up on massive leftovers  Since I gave up buying sides of beef years ago  lllllong hairy story  my freezer has the room ,5,2016-07-10
LOVE Gaucho   The Bondiola sandwich is my favorite   Great service  excellent food ,5,2018-12-20
Worth it     Best steak sandwich I ve ever eaten ,5,2019-10-16
mind  EXPLOSION   i had the grilled chicken sandwich  it even had some potatoes in there  BREAD IS AMAZING  next time  gonna get involved with some STEAK   my friend got the corn on the cob and it looked so legit  he wouldnt even share   I DREAM OF THIS TYPE OF FOOD,5,2013-09-25
Elevator Review  Long line  but deliciously worth the wait for meat lovers   Or order takeout    Gaucho is fantastic  On our first visit we waited in line for more than   hours  And it was worth it   I had the Cerdo  roasted pork with roasted onions  greens and grilled bread   This was quite possibly the greatest pork I have ever had  Juicy  flavorful and paired perfectly with sides   My wife had the small strip steak   again perfectly cooked   We shared roasted vegetables and empanadas   both delicious   But to me  the real star is the dipping sauces  My wife is obsessed with the chimichurri  while I love the garlic and roasted onion    Tip    Gaucho doesn t serve alcohol  but they don t have corkage fees and encourage you to bring your own  Bring wine  which many people did  or walk down the street to one of the many fine purveyors of alcohol in the Strip District  we went to East End Brewing Company     Tip    If you don t want to wait  just order for carry out  Call early and walk right to the front of the line and take your order home ,5,2018-03-05
The   stars for this place is well deserved  It s hard to put into words how good it really is  My advice to those who haven t been here before is to come at an off peak time  if that s really a thing  because the line can grow very long really fast  Back to the food    ordered the pork sandwich with the corn pudding  Melts in your mouth  Don t take my words for it JUST GO  ,5,2015-09-18
Amazing  Great food and lovely atmosphere   We had the Ribeye Steak plates and lemon bread pudding   The staff was friendly  pleasant and the service was good   We can t wait to return   When we got there   it was just before close and the line was long but it went pretty quickly and we got into a conversation with some other first timers   we all had heard good things and were excited    I caught up with them after their meal and it turns out we all had the same thing    They were raving about it as much as we were    Parking was a challenge but well worth it ,5,2019-03-21
REVIEW          stars  Gaucho lives up to the hype  My goodness       Everything is great and cooked perfectly  Honestly  this is also one of the best value meals in the city  The quality to cost ratio is really amazing for the consumer    Here s what I recommend  Carne Sandwich  Ribeye cooked medium rare   Any two sides  they change seasonally   Empanadas  mix   You won t be sorry    The food is a   stars  the atmosphere is a   stars  the seating is a   star  So  if you get there any time after        get ready to wait  Like       Kennywood  Phantom s Revenge on field trip day wait  The wait is long  BUT that makes your dining experience really nice because the main dining room is small and not overcrowded  I still give   stars because this food       Heavenly    Tipping is up to your discretion because you pay up front  It s a laid back environment  Great sauces  Everything is amazing    Go to Gaucho  Seriously  go now ,5,2016-12-01
Growing up in PR  we didn t have fancy Brazilian Steak Houses  we had fancy Argentinian Parrilladas  When we were exploring places to visit in our visit to Pittsburgh  this place popped towards the top of the places to visit  and when my friend mentioned it  I couldn t be more excited   This Parilla is a casual place where you place your order at the counter and then are seated  The food is delivered to your table  They have sodas and water but not beer or wine  They do have a byob policy   The menu consists mainly of Argentinian specialties  and  of course  the ultimate Argentinian specialty  beef   Since there were   of us at the table  we ordered a sample plate with an additional flank steak  We also ordered the grilled corn  Gaucho Papas  and humitas  a savory corn pudding   We also got the empanadas  and chicken wings as starters and the grilled pineapple  and alfajores for dessert   There was a selection of different sauces to pick from  from the traditional chimichurri to a slightly spicy pepper one   The chicken wings and beef empanadas were ok  not really that great  The beef needed seasoning and the wings were a little dry  Using the sauces provided helped a lot with these items  The same with the humitas   The alfajores were a bit dry  the cookie was crumbly and dry and took away from the delicious filling   But everything else was really good  The steaks were delicious and flavorful and the sauces complimented them to perfection  The grilled corn was really tasty  although I would have preferred a bit more salt  and the grilled pineapple is probably the best application of this idea I ve ever had  so damned good   All in all the meal was a hit  with not one dish that I would consider bad  and many items that I would happily eat all the time   For the price  this place definitely deserves the   stars ,5,2016-07-06
A small restaurant where people are standing and eating  Why are they all smiling  They know something that when you walk in off the street you could not know   The food is excellent and fresh introducing you to many new flavores  The shrimp is some of the best I have ever eaten  The service is pleasant and helpful and fun  Don t pass up this one  ,5,2013-08-30
We arrived right around opening on a Saturday afternoon and the line was already out the door  By the time we finished and came out  the line was wrapped around to the bridge  so come early or be prepared to wait    The food was fresh and made to order  They have a system where you order first and are seated afterwards as tables open up  We tried the bife de gaucho  cooked perfectly to medium rare   gaucho salad  empanadas  one of each  and the chorizo  They also had a variety of sauces to try with the food  We didn t think our order would be enough for   people  but we were stuffed by the end of the meal  Everything was delicious and we d definitely love to come back if we re ever in Pittsburgh again ,5,2018-09-29
The food is great  I went on a Thursday night around  pm and there was a bit of a line to order but didn t have to wait for any tables  Any wait time is worth it though  I got the flank steak and it was tender and flavorful  The toast is delicious too ,5,2016-01-29
Best steak sandwich I ve ever had  Although the ribeye sandwich I had was thoroughly cooked  it was still very tender and flavorful  The prices are not cheap  but it is worth every bite  I wish I had the chance to try more from their menu  The new restaurant is very nice  The decor gives the right ambiance for the type of food they are serving  Would recommend this to anyone who s visiting Pittsburgh ,5,2015-06-03
This place has the hype and still knocks it out of the park  I got the ribeye steak sandwich and it was next level  No complaints  One of the best meals in Pittsburgh ,5,2016-10-05
My father is born and raised Argentinian and my family knows great food   So when I came to visit my father in Pittsburgh we heard so much about this place and we made the trip down to the strip district   This possibly might have been one of the better dinners I have ever had  Authentically cut beef  Empanadas were good  Veggies amazing  The roasted garlic dipping sauce  The braised beef sandwich absolutely to die for with the perfect bread to stay crispy and soak up juices     Why yes that is   different cuts of beef  Yes that is beef empanadas  braised beef sandwich  flank steak  grilled veggies and salads  And yes it was magical  Probably one of the best places I have ever eaten at   You have to get here early or you will get stuck in line outside the door  But if you get caught     It s well worth the wait ,5,2016-07-22
Gaucho s is a must stop while in the  Burgh   Absolutely delicious meats and sides  herbed potatoes and grilled vegetable platter were both awesome    We had the Asado Platter which at     gives you slices of   of their different meats   This was enough meat for our family of   when paired with sides and of course a side order of chorizo   For chorizo  go with the spicy selection which in my book was perfection   The set up here is you wait on line to order   On a Thursday night around  pm we waited about    minutes     Once you order the food comes quickly   Wait staff helps finds you a table and you help yourselves to sauces  plates and silverware   Be sure to BYOB and keep in mind I wasn t able to find a liquor store in the immediate area   Desserts are delicious   the cinnamon bread pudding was exceptional   Only minuses for us were      Our waitress dumped our food across the floor when she lost her grip on a serving tray   This isn t typical and she almost cried which made me feel bad for her   They apologized up and down and brought a replacement within minutes   Hey  it happens      They encourage you to order dessert up front and that they ll hold it for you until your ready     They dropped it at our table mid meal so it was starting to cool when we were ready for it   They need to get this better sorted or simply wait to order it   Despite these minuses  I still give it a solid   stars for what it is    Meaty awesomeness   Give it a try  you won t be disappointed ,4,2016-04-08
So   wow    Normally  I write lengthy reviews on food  service  aesthetics  atmosphere  etc   but I will get right to the point    This place is amazing in every way  Go ,5,2014-10-04
Even an hour wait for dinner could not detract from this amazing place  The service should train everyone else in the business on  how to provide the best service   They were caring  kind  attentive without being intrusive  knowledgeable  honest and made the night  Oh  and the food  We came for the paella and LOVED it   It takes about    minutes so we ordered the wings too  Flavorful  slightly spicy and incredibly tender  Would love to return to try EVERYTHING  Great night ,5,2016-04-10
Amazing food and well worth the wait  We re from Mississippi but visit Pgh every year for a week  No matter what we have planned  this place is a must ,5,2019-07-05
Quite possibly the best Hamburger I ever had   The meat was seasoned perfectly   Try the various dips they have to add some extra flavor ,5,2016-06-29
Absolutely amazing food   We were lucky enough to get there when it wasn t super busy and were able to get a table   I had the chicken sandwich and it had an amazing smokey flavor and was very juicy   Definitely will come back ,5,2016-02-08
This place  under most circumstances  would get five stars  The only downside is the long wait  During our most recent visit my wife and I spent    minutes in line  The food and service are amazing and well worth the wait  BUT  if you can get there right when the restaurant opens or go during the week you can avoid the lines   I always get the Bondiola    roasted pork sandwich with a mustard sauce and caramelized onions  AMAZING  The bread is incredible     My wife got the El Gaucho Salad with chicken added  She also gets QuiQui Rimichi sauce on the side  DELICIOUS   BYOB    You won t be disappointed  ,4,2018-06-18
The Rosemary Braised Beef is every bit as mythic and mighty and marvelous as its now incredible internet hype would have you believe  There s a baguette that holds a generous wad of paper thin savory  fragrant beef sheets that are cooked slowly for an eternity  Caramelized onion and horseradish sauce are added for the sake of sweetness and punch  That s all there is  It is a Philly Cheesesteak gone rustic and cowboy  the campfire aromas of this small establishment beckoning people from late afternoon to early evening  So yes  GPA does a     job of making mundane meats taste extraordinary in a confined space and within a quick serve framework   I don t seem to be reading much about the desserts  though  I don t recall GPA selling them during my last visit  Regardless  my readers should give them your undivided attention    The bill of fare lists   of which Kay and I tried    First at bat were the spectacularly scrumptious Panqueques  A crucifix of slightly scorched crepes  each rolled wafer resembled a tuile cookie in terms of flavor and chewy brittle mouthfeel  Topping them was merely chocolate syrup  but filling them was a creamy  carnal  somewhat briny caramel that clung to the palate like a desperate lover    The second sweet treat came in the form of Alfajores  Coming off as a cross between a macaroon and a Fig Newton  the trio of cookies come either with lemon or cinnamon flavors and also contain caramel  La Dorita Dulce de Leche   Soft  sticky  and full of sugary bravado  one could imagine having these with tea in more genteel surroundings instead of the gritty Strip District    Apparently  Gaucho Parrilla Argentina fits the definition of a runaway sensation while still measuring up to the buzz it has unassumingly created  Who would have guessed they be the kings of Pittsburgh Yelp    years ago on a February night  I was hoping they d remain a secret gem    P S  Outdoor seating is available now  Indoor seating remains very limited  Prepare to opt for take out ,5,2015-04-13
Awesome carnivore BYOB paradise   Steak  braised beef  chorizo  yams and bread pudding to die  and wait in line  for   A real gem   Been there twice in past two months and can t wait to go back ,5,2016-01-03
It s possible to get here when the line isn t impossibly long  but you have to time it right  Every steak I ve gotten here from every cut has been delicious  Obviously it s not a place to take a vegetarian for their birthday  but if you like steak you have to go at least once ,5,2019-08-07
Delicious ribeye steak plate with salad  sweet onion  and chimichurri  I would love to come back and try the carne asada and other delicious meats ,5,2018-10-24
Holy crap   I had Gaucho for lunch this summer  but it was their food truck   No offense  GPA   but that food truck isn t necessarily doing you any favors   Not that it was bad   It wasn t   It just wasn t as great as the food I got at the restaurant     Which   okay   was great   Sorry for the spoiler   Great food     No reservations  so there s usually a line  but honestly the wait was no more than probably   minutes AT LUNCH     I had the special   Gaucho Banh Mi   It was delicious   See above   My date had empanadas that she then shared with me   Because she s awesome  but we re not rating her   the empanadas   ALSO awesome     Every sauce condiment was drinkably good  though honestly  i don t recommend that    The staff was super high energy and friendly   So if you don t like friendly people this may not be the place for you     Cool vibe  great food  great staff   Five star   Bang   Done ,5,2017-11-29
This place is always a solid good casual meal even for upscale foodies  Aid place to chill out and have tasty food  First time having their chicken and it was yum  Always a lot of people here so make sure you go in or order at most an hour before they close because they WILL cut you off  No soup for you  Their gaucho sandwich is off the wall but it s been a few years since I first tried it  Don t think anything has changed  just gotten better  So if you eat beef  WHADDAYA WAITIN FOR  The only thing that has changed is their expansion which means more people have gotten to appreciate this place as much as I did a few  Years ago   ,5,2017-05-08
There were four of us so we tried the Asado platter which gave everyone a taste of five different cuts of beef  flank steak  filet mignon  sirloin  ribeye and one more   The filet and sirloin were considered the tastiest but all were good  We added corn  potatoes and mushroom sides  Perfect combo along with our mate iced tea ,5,2017-07-14
Absolutely amazing meal  the best we had while visiting Pittsburgh  Went on a Saturday around   and had to wait about    mins on the line before we got to order  totally worth it  We tried the sirloin steak platter  medium rare   the sweet and spicy sausages  empanadas  and a flan for dessert  The steak was amazing and perfectly cooked  The sauces are really fun to try and dip the steak in  Really loved the sausages  preferred the spicy ones  I got too full to even try to empanadas  The flan was just Okay  would skip this next time,5,2019-08-22
Today was our first time here and from the service to the food to the decor of the tiny place we give it   stars  This is a must visit if you are in Pittsburgh  I highly recommend the con pan Carne with skirt steak  Yum,5,2014-06-06
It s truly the best restaurant in Pittsburgh  The people are friendly  the food and sauces are awesome and the brussel sprouts with bacon are to die for  It s sort of a pain having to wait in line but its so worth it ,5,2016-05-13
I just love the rich flavor of the food here   I got the Rosemary Braised Beef  which was just so delicious and filling  I would totally get it again  and all the other options on the menu seem so yummy as well  There was a period of waiting outside and inside as well  since the seating area isn t particularly large and part of the inside area is also a waiting area  Nonetheless  the wait was bearable and it didn t take too long  I would say it was definitely worth the wait  and I would be happy to come here again to try another one of their menu items  ,5,2018-06-07
Incredible food  by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh  Usually I need extreme spice to enjoy my food whether in the form of peppers or hot sauce but the medley of flavors in these dishes is perfect and no spice is necessary  The braised beef with horseradish is a must try and any of the salads with any of the steaks  i love the flank    BUT they do have lots of delicious of sauces if you need something to perfectly compliment your dishes  see photos     New on the menu are the scallops  which I love more than anything they serve  especially the fresh grapefruit mixed in with the seafood dish    I could go on but essentially anything I ve ordered at this place has been phenomenal  And they now have outdoor seating as opposed to just the small space available inside ,5,2014-08-10
Favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh  handsdown  The only hang up is that there is always a line  Trust me  it s worth the wait  The steak is always cooked perfectly and the i highly recommend getting the seasonal sides like the corn ,5,2018-05-06
We were supposed to visit friends today and they were going to treat us to a special dinner they were going to make but they had the flu or the crud or something     so instead we went to Gaucho and had a SCRUMPTIOUS meal to help assuage our disappointment  Man  was it good  This little place is a gem and the short wait in line was really worth it  We had carne of filet mignonette and rosemary carbones accompanied by simple toasted  taters with bacon  The sauces    all fresh made and take as much as you want    were indescribable  This place is killer  And the best part  We re going to send the bill to our  sick  friends and they ll never even know it was for us because they re so ill  They won t have a clue  Hahaha ,5,2014-07-11
It s been   years and the physical shop has greatly expanded to a very warm  inviting space   Although the place is packed  the tables are spacious with fresh flowers and a napkin dispenser   Cause you may need a lot of napkins  Beef can be messy   Wash your hands before you start  finger licking will commence   The Provoletta is still spectacular  Steak sandwich  flavorful and delicious  Mashed sweet potatoes as lovely as they are tasty  Rosemary beef sandwich  a mile high and so  so yummy   A lot has changed  but the important stuff is exactly the same ,5,2017-02-26
The chocolate is out of this world  Tried the bacon chocolate and pretzels they both were amazing ,5,2015-12-17
food comes in a big portion  Empanada was delicious  Pre paid system  Servers are very friendly and they are fast with refilling water ,4,2017-07-26
This was quite possibly the best lunch we have ever had  The line to get in on a child  rainy Saturday morning was not too bad  the menu was easy to follow and quite impressive  and the staff were very welcoming  They even ask if you have questions before you order and one guy showed us a picture of one of the meals  We could tell they are all proud of where they work  On to the food  The roasted pork was one of the most delicious things I have ever put in my mouth and the sausage  spicy  was delicious as well with the red peppers and onions  We would go here again and again ,5,2016-10-23
Let me just start by saying the people that work here are friendly  well mannered  and awesome    They welcome you help you order and participate in the entire experience   My boyfriend got the Rosemary beef sandwich   And loved every bite   I got the carne asada sandwich and it was delightful   The music playing was artsy and fun  The whole atmosphere was positive and happy   Be sure to try the sauces with whatever you order they come in mason jars near the ordering area and are yummy   Was curious to see if all the hype was real and it s definitely worth your time to stand in like and enjoy the food   ,5,2016-03-04
I sort of liked this place  It s just awkward because there s not many places to sit and where they are located isn t an area where you can go outside and find a place to eat  I m glad they are here  it s nice to have something different to try ,3,2015-08-17
No complaints at all  Very tasty  reasonable  and I look forward to going back    Customer service was on point  The sauces for the dishes almost steal the show   almost  The meats were fantastic ,5,2017-09-30
This is probably my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh  The meat is phenomenal and the sauces are a MUST  The menu has staples but the sides and small plates are always changing which is nice to spice things up ,5,2018-07-25
So much hype that it was VERY hard to get my husband to go with me   The silence as we devoured our steak sandwich said it all   The hype is true    the food is amazingly delicious ,5,2016-01-25
Attended an event in the lower level   Food was terrific and owner was there to make sure all went smoothly   Great mixed drinks and an over all good experience ,5,2015-10-03
My sister suggested I come here during a work trip  I was absolutely not disappointed  Very cool funky atmosphere and awesome employees  It s a quick service type place but they run your food out and bus tables  I got a small ny strip steak for      and it was fantastic  Good portion size  cooked perfectly and came with a great salad and toasted bread  Wish I lived closer ,5,2015-08-04
AMAZING  This one word describes it all   This is a small joint located right before the market strip  Although underwhelming on the outside  the food offered inside was absolutely delicious    The one thing that could ve  used improvement that the great food made up for was definitely the service  Although the lady who took our order was not entirely rude  she wasn t the most helpful or friendly either  We were trying to get her opinion on what to order but she sort of gave us the  arms up  attitude and claimed it was all good  As there was a lot of items on the menu it was hard to decide  Everything was also written in Spanish so you really had to read the descriptions to know what you re getting yourself into especially if you don t know Spanish    We ended up ordering a Rosemary braised beef sandwich  pork tenderloin with caramelized mushrooms and onions  a side of roasted potatoes and two empanadas to start  All of these items were absolutely to die for  The beef brisket sandwich came with a horse radish sauce that elevated the flavour to another level  The pork was so juicy and tender it practically melted in our mouths  Even the roasted potatoes were packed with flavour leaving no tastebuds behind  Our empanadas were also a great way to start our meal because the beef inside them was well seasoned and perfectly balanced    During our meal one of the kitchen staff also came to ask us how our meal was and that definitely redeemed the initial service we had  Especially considering the layout of this restaurant is small and offers limited seating that is first come first serve with a order and bring your food to the table kind of vibe    This place definitely knows their meat and they offer great flavours  If you re ever in town or have been thinking of making a visit  JUST DO IT  You won t regret it ,5,2015-04-04
BottomLine  Destination  yup  Faves  wing  pork  shrimp  In a bizarre way  their pork is my fave pulled pork in PGH  It s wonderfully smoked  and you can accoutre it w chimi or garlic or onion sauce  but it s awesome on its own  w the crusty bread that comes with   Backing up  we started w the wings  Just say   Yes   This could be an entree  Big  meaty w a wonderful smoke   K had the shrimp  and it was fantastically grilled and  flavorful enough so they definitely made it theirs  but not too much to step on the subtleties of the beast   Evil dark chocolate dessert  If you can t make din din for some silly reason  get the deep dark chocolate loveliness   Table full of regular guys had sammies  and they looked all that  even if you just see the bread   Ambiance is plain  functional but the chunky wooden tables and seats appeal to me  Staff is knowledgeable and very pleasant  those who are fans of fashionable female form may get more from their visit   I believe this is still a BYO ,5,2016-11-18
Stopped in for dinner and at first I was a bit unsure of what I had gotten into  The decode is interesting with a huge menu up on the wall with a short walk to the counter  There isn t really anywhere to give the menu a wince over and make your choices  That however is the only negative I encountered  The staff  when we ordered we re super nice and helpful  We were shown a table and went to gather our extra plates and tableware  The floor staff made sure our drinks were filled and knew our name for the order to be delivered  When the food arrived it was perfectly cooked  I got the   steak option  All seasoned great with perfect char and tender  Wee has the potatoes with roasted garlic cloves   so good  Mushrooms and risotto both were hard to stop eating  There was also pulled pork at the table that was enormous and absolutely excellent  Ended with the chocolate cyan cookie    wow was that good  Really glad we went here and will absolutely go back ,5,2017-03-10
In terms of combining amazing food and a great atmosphere  Gaucho Parrilla Argentina stood out head and shoulders above the rest of the  very good  restaurants I tried on a recent trip to Pittsburgh  Plusses  amazing food  both vegetarian and meatetarian  hilarious staff  who were yelling and singing and just having a blast the entire time  like  imagine the happy townsfolk at the beginning of some Disney movie  Minuses  Gaucho Parrilla Argentina exists only in the world and not inside us  as in  to return I will have to return to Pittsburgh ,5,2015-01-25
Um  YUM  Every sauce was awesome  best potatoes ever  how do I make those   I m going home to try  The staff was friendly  our food came quickly and I wish I lived closer so I could try more items ,5,2018-01-12
Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is one of the best restaurants I have ever dined at  My experience began rocky  with a    minute wait  But  the wait was completely worth it  The food came quickly and was extremely hot  We ordered the provoletta  empanadas  pescado sandwich  el gaucho salad  flank steak  and roasted cauliflower  Everything we ate was delectable  The el gaucho salad was scrumptious  with fresh vegetables and a light dressing  The provoletta did not disappoint either  and was one of my favorite dishes  The flank steak and pescado sandwich were otherworldly  for they burst with flavor  The empanadas were fine  but a tad lackluster in flavor compared to the other dishes ordered  My personal favorite component of the meal was the toast  Though almost everything comes with toast  but do not undermine as a plain food or label it as the underdog  It was seasoned to perfection and the right amount crunchy  To be honest  I would eat at Gaucho again just for the toast  Making Gaucho even better  the staff is amicable and quick  They made conversation with us as we waited  and you could genuinely tell they were trying to move as fast as possible so people could sit down and start enjoying their meal  The wait  in my opinion  was completely worth it but not something to be ignored  Nevertheless  I can guarantee you I will dine at Gaucho Parrilla Argentina again  even if I have to wait an hour ,5,2018-07-12
Over an hour wait in the rain but worth it  The staff was pleasant and our food came fast  The food was delicious ,5,2017-10-29
Great food  Got a bit of a buzz drinking some craft beers with my doctor friends  so I don t remember what I ordered  I do remember it was meaty and good  Your belly will appreciate coming here  I would have given it   stars but I was a bit tipsy when I went and don t remember some of the night    ,4,2016-07-18
The food was very good  My flank steak was grilled perfectly and I loved the seasoning   We had chocolate bread pudding and cookies for dessert  A great way to end a great meal  Really amazing   The best thing about Guacho was the staff working there      Excellent      They were friendly and very helpful  We were very impressed with Isabel      My friends and l will be back due to great food  and even better service,5,2016-03-02
Rid culos  So tasty   Treat yourself to this little gem before the line reaches Argentina ,5,2014-08-20
Talk about awesome and tasty food  I loved this place when it was a small hole in the wall and the quality definitely did not suffer when they expanded  Highly recommend eating here   especially the Rosemary Braised Beef ,5,2015-11-11
Gigantic amazing sandwiches   Yeah   Freaking good meat   I love the apps too   Soooo good ,5,2014-09-13
This place was great  Food was delicious and their sauces were on point  I recommend this place to anyone  Chicken was a little dry but other than that everything was great  Will def come back if I m ever in the area again ,3,2016-02-15
Got the Roasted Pork sandwich and it was amazing ,5,2016-07-31
This place is    on the Yelp      list of places to eat in america  why haven t you been here yet      This place is also BYOB and the service style is different which is a nice change of pace   You stand in line  get there before  pm for dinner  you will only have about a    minute wait   If you wait later you could wait for a LONG time   You place your order  find a table  get all your sauces to each on the side  crack your bottle of wine  beer  etc and relax   Servers will call your order s name and bring it to you   The last time we were there the servers were super friendly and accommodating     I have had the meat plate with skirt steak  brussels  spicy and sweet   a filet sandwich  and a skirt steak sandwich in my   times there   The bread they serve the deliciously favored meat on is reason to go alone   The only thing to be aware of is they serve the meat pretty close to rare mid rare  so if you don t like meat cooked that way  let then know when you are ordering   I love the red sauce and the garlic one  but try them all and pick your favorite  This place really is great  so get there sooner than later   ,5,2016-01-18
You do EVERYTHING right   The menu comprehensive  prices reasonable  the staff educated   the food so deliciously different than same old stuff   Had the steak platters  corn on the cob  papas  and delicious dulce de leche cookies   There are no complaints  other restaurants should take note   Will return again ,5,2015-08-26
I was in town for a Steelers game last weekend and we had decided to go here for dinner  Some of the best food I ve had  I love that you can bring in your own wine and they will uncork it for you right in line while you wait to order,5,2018-01-06
Alright  so it s not like this place needs anymore fantastic reviews  but after a meal as delicious as the one I had here  I feel like I should add one anyway  My mom and I came here for lunch at the end of the rush hour  so we chose to order a bunch of things  since we figured it wouldn t take very long  and take leftovers home  Each of us got small El Gaucho salads with skirt steak  plus the Provoletta app  a   pc sweet and hot chorizo app  and a side of  rusted roots   The salads were awesome   the veggies were crisp  the flavors meshed well  and the steak was truly amazing  I always order rare steak and this place cooked it perfectly  The quality of the meat was excellent  as well  The Provoletta app was delicious and perfectly melty    however  I took half home and had it for dinner  cold  and the cheese was still a stand out  even cold   We could barely take more than a few bites of the chorizo app and the rusted roots  but not for lack of trying  The chorizo  I preferred the spicy but the sweet was good too  was juicy and had a great blend of spices  Finally  one of the things that made me want to try this place in the first place was the veggie pictures  and I was not disappointed by the rusted roots  This place proves that you can be  meat centered  but still serve up some amazing veggie dishes  I highly recommend the parsnips but frankly all of the veggies in the mix were excellent  One more note about food   try ALL OF THE HOMEMADE SAUCES  On your veggies  on the toast  on the meat   they are all different and so  so good  The service was great  although again  we came at a slow time   A little on the pricier end  but not horrible   you d probably end up spending about the same if you went to Panera Bread  and there is no comparison to the quality here  I will definitely be a repeat customer ,5,2017-12-12
Asked for a recommendation and the gentleman at the counter said to get the steak sandwich with ribeye or skirt  I went with the skirt steak medium rare  Honestly might be the best steak sandwich I ve ever had  Served in a paper wrapping  topped with roasted red bell peppers  carmelized onions  and chimichurri sauce  Phenomenal ,5,2018-02-27
I went to Gaucho with   friends who were visiting from out of town  one of them has a father from Argentina   As a vegetarian  I was prepared to just vicariously enjoy her enjoyment as I sat and had a minimal meal   Not so   I was very pleasantly surprised that this very meat heavy restaurant also has plenty of vegetarian options that are extremely delicious   It also has a fun vibe   Just thinking about what I had there  one of every vegetarian side  makes me want to head back there soon ,5,2016-12-02
In my   years in Pittsburgh as a college student searching for the best local places to eat  none have come even close to Gaucho in terms of quality  price  and overall experience   The   star rating accurately reflects how good this place is  and I would say without a doubt that it s the single best restaurant in Pittsburgh    As you walk in the door  you are greeted by the glorious smell of a fantastic assortment of meats sizzling over a wood fired grill  I have so far tried three different dishes  and honestly cannot choose a favorite  as they re all that good   This is one of the first places I ve ever been to where I actually want to make an honest attempt to try everything on the menu      Prices are very reasonable  especially considering the quality  A lot of love goes into these dishes  and the chefs take great care in both cooking  and plating them   The food itself is a work of art  and tastes absolutely every bit as good as it looks   Everything that I have tried so far has been very well thought out  with all the pieces of the dish working exquisitely well with one another  creating a tantalizing dance of flavors that envelope your taste buds and give them a big warm hug that says  I love you     Service was spectacular as well   All the way from the chef to the cashier who will bring your prepared food to wherever you happen to be sitting  the service was flawless   Very friendly  very efficient  and shows a great deal of caring about what they do  and making sure you as a customer get the fullest possible enjoyment out of your experience    I honestly don t think I ll ever go anywhere else ever again for meats  Gaucho is so far above it s competition that they seem like cheap fast food in comparison   Give this place a try  I guarantee you ll find something there that you ll love ,5,2015-01-28
I love this place  Food was cooked to perfection and very tasty too  Will definitely go again on my next visit to the  Burgh  ,4,2015-12-02
I wish there was a   star score   I wouldn t feed this to my dog  if I had one   I got a pulled chicken sandwich   First three bites had a chicken bone in each bite  one piece was nearly an inch long   Then  there s the charred beyond all recognition things  maybe onions    in the sandwich   Further examination showed undercooked  pink  pieces of chicken   How they scorched some of it and undercooked some of it is quite a mystery    Unfortunately  I got my food to go  so I can t complain there   If you want to risk it  eat there and examine your food carefully before you bite in      I have a picture of the mess  if I can figure out how to upload ,1,2014-12-04
There s really nothing I could say that hasn t already been said about the great food this place has  Oh wait  they don t take Amex  Lol  Great food ,5,2014-11-01
Had a great meal here   Fantastic grilled beef  chicken and shrimp  The beef  especially  is so flavorful and has a unique texture to it   It is really different from traditional American BBQ or Brazilian BBQ   You have to try this place to experience it   Yes  the line is long and they don t take reservation but it is well worth the wait   Service was very friendly and efficient ,5,2018-04-08
The wait here was very long  but that is because the food is delicious  You order at the counter  and then you sit down and the staff brings you your food  The portion sizes are great and the food tastes amazing  especially the bread  My boyfriend got the steak sandwich  which you can choose your cut of steak  and I got the fish sandwich  made with fish of the day   Plus we split veggie and pork empanadas with some potatoes  There are small containers with   chimichurri sauces that you can bring to your table to sample  The price is very fair for the quality and taste of food  The casual atmosphere also is a plus ,5,2017-11-03
Great experience  Hip place   Crowd was mostly young adults   some looked like empty nesters  Had a San Francisco joint feel to it which I liked  Trendy but relaxed atmosphere    Food was nice   Tried their grilled shrimps  chicken wings  and the beef burger  It had a fancy name that I don t remember  Be prepared to stand in line for a while on a busy night before you order  After you order and pay  you are seated and food brought to you relatively quickly  Kitchen is behind he counter so you can see the action while waiting in line  Prices are fair to a bit high  Don t go there if you are looking  for a quite place  Louder music and people talking in a not so big place  We were loud too so were fine  Saw a couple changing seats due to noise but I m sure it didn t help    If they could do something about the long lines which easily goes out the door around the block and noise levels  would give them   stars ,4,2016-10-02
There is almost always a long wait for this place  but for good reason  The food is amazing  and they have all these different kinds of sauces that you can help yourself to  The desserts are great too  try the bread pudding ,5,2017-10-31
This is the place to be if you were to ever visit Pittsburgh or a Pittsburgh native  This restaurant is worth the long line because the food is delicious and so worth it   I highly recommend the rosemary beef sandwich  I also recommend trying the different types the sauces that is readily available on the stand,5,2016-05-14
Very good  always a line  but worth the wait   Hanger Steak  Flank Steak  Grilled Vegetables and Potatoes were all very good   The different sauces they have are awesome   This place lives up to everything that is said written   Must visit   it s pretty much a take out place  but they do have limited counter seating ,4,2015-03-14
AMAZING   The wait outside was soooo worth it   Everything from the meat to the sauces to the vegetables  salad  even the toast  everything was amazing   The food was excellent   We will definitely be back  ,5,2016-06-22
This place is off the charts great  Don t let the long line keep you from going   it moves fast  The food is fantastic  staff is friendly  and the atmosphere is cozy  I cannot wait to go back ,5,2016-03-24
I ve been to the strip plenty of times and drove past this teeny place on the way out and always wondered about if it was any good and if we should try it but we were always on our way home with a car full of groceries  When I read the reviews I had to go to see if all the rave reviews were true   How I wish we would ve stopped a long time ago   Everything everyone I went with ordered was delicious and cooked to perfection   I had the rosemary braised beef sandwich   SO GOOD  My sister got the skirt steak small platter and it was so tender and flavorful  which is hard to do with skirt steak   My nephew got the ny strip small platter and also done to perfection   There was more than enough food and everything was amazing   We couldn t decide which sauce was the best   they were all so good   Get the roasted potatoes too   you won t be sorry   I m already planning my next meal there   will definitely be back   Don t hesitate   just go  The only thing you ll regret is not discovering this place sooner ,5,2015-03-23
This is our new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh  Despite the    minute wait to get a table  it is well worth the wait  The food came out quickly and it was done to perfection  I got the spicy chorizo sandwich which was incredible and my wife got the steak which was done to her liking   Highly recommend but it is a first come and first serve  Well worth the wait,5,2018-07-26
Fantastic food  Highly recommend the wings   The customer service could use some work  Manager owner looking guy was rude when I came in the door  rude when I asked about seating and rude when I requested that they add avocado to my salad  since I had paid for it and it was nowhere to be found   He ruined my experience ,3,2016-09-18
I have updated this review to five stars  because I never followed up with a better review  but I have been back on several occasions and have had amazing food every time  Every  Single  Time  In fact  I recently tried their empanadas again  which I always counted as the weakest point in their game  and I was stunned by how much better they are than I recalled   For the sake of history  my original review  where I assigned them two stars  follows   I love Gaucho  It is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh   Unfortunately  today I had a terrible meal at Gaucho    far worse than any previous experience there  My coworker and I both had steak burgers for lunch  and we both thought that they were very salty and overcooked  We both ordered our burgers to be cooked to medium  and they came easily well done  Additionally  the bread they were served on was more burnt than toasted   Gaucho is still a favorite  but I hope that food like I had today will not be recurring   I fully expect to leave a far more favorable review on my next visit ,5,2015-09-02
This place was a pleasant surprise find in Pittsburgh  Meat was cooked perfectly and had great flavor and the chimichurri sauces were all delicious   For sides I had the gaucho potatoes and the maiz  corn on the cob  and they were both really good  To my surprise though  the prices seemed a bit much for Pittsburgh  coming from San Francisco  I m used to paying a bit more for things  and this was comparable to the prices we see out in SF  Besides that though  the place had a good vibe  it appeared to be pretty popular and I m glad I found it for when I come back next time ,4,2015-07-22
Amazing cuts of meat but their provoleta is a glorified open faced grill cheese  Not how it s authenticly done ,4,2017-10-05
Came here for late brunch on a Friday  Our party of    was able to find seating quickly  We ordered everything from paella  sirloin steak  steak sandwiches  potato sides  and chorizo sampler dish  Everything was cooked very well  Meats were tender  juicy and well flavored  Potatoes had a nice garlic and thyme herb roasted taste to them  The salads had a variety of spinach and other greens your not limited to just ice burg lettuce   Paella took about    minutes to prepare  Feeds around     people  They put plenty of sausage  chicken  mussels  shrimp  and clams in this dish  Shrimp was a lil overcooked and rice should ve been cooked for another   minutes  Rice still had a lil of the hard texture to it   One of my friends who lives in the area recommended this place and we were surprised we got seated quickly  They have a sauce and silver ware station  Sauce here is everything  They have this roasted pepper  chimichurri and pesto type sauce that everyone needs to try  It s so good that you need to try different combinations on all of your food  Everything seems to be self service  but the kind waiters do come out to clear plates  refill drinks and check in on you   Highly recommend this place if your a big meat person and enjoy Argentinian dishes  Portions are reasonable  food is priced fairly and you get quality ingredients here  There is plenty of street parking in the area  I do hear the place can get crowded so expect a wait  Parties are first come first serve and you can t reserve seats,5,2017-03-03
I m going to sound a little insane  but I was stalking this place for a while  I d heard good things about it from my friend  who described it as  that godly place in the Strip that has five stars on Yelp   Naturally  I was a little curious  I swear  I checked their Facebook page every few days while it was closed for renovations to see when they d be back up    Well  as you guess by this review  I finally made it  And it was worth it    ATMOSPHERE  while I hadn t been to the old one  the new interior is lovely and has many different seating options  Unfortunately  this place can get full quickly  so we were stuck at a table where the setting sun shone directly into our eyes   SERVICE  amazing   While we were waiting in line  one of the staff came out and asked if anyone had questions  I asked about one of the sauces on the menu  and he brought out said sauce with a small spoon for me to try it  If you re intimidated by the Spanish on the menu  just ask for help  Also  one of my friends wanted to switch out one of his sides for corn on the cob  and they were totally cool with it    FOOD  my rosemary braised beef sandwich was delicious  I am a huge fan of crusty bread with big beautiful air pockets  and the meat was cooked to perfection  If you re at this place  it is basically assumed you love meat  so be ready to eat plenty of meat  However  two pieces of bread and all that beef was too much for me to bite at once  so I did an open face sort of thing and used the other piece of bread to dip in their various sauces  I encourage you to test all the sauces and find your favorite ,5,2015-08-06
Yum  Great food  AWESOME service  Cheap  easy  fun little place and Pittsburgh needs like ten other spots to open that s run by these guys  Highly recommend ,4,2014-03-24
The line out the door is totally worth it  Even in freezing temperatures  Ok  maybe not but hey  you can call and skip the line   I totally didn t know that   I ve visited Gaucho once way before they expanded the space  I loved it then but I had to check out the new space before writing a review  Despite the added room  it s still rather an uncomfortable experience when coming here because of the cramped  waiting  area  However  there is a defined process for ordering and eating  but the board right outside the door will tell you exactly how it works which is great and prevents confusion and chaos  Usually there is a line out the door  which is dependent on when you come here of course  When there is a line out the door  the point from the door to time of ordering is about    minutes  Sounds crazy but it isn t that bad  Once you order and they seat you  food comes out in a snap  I think this makes up for the waiting time in line    Anyway  Food  Everything is well seasoned to perfection here  As if the dishes weren t so bold and flavorful already  they have four sauces that are each out of this world  They re all tasty but if you aren t sure  ask them to describe what each sauce is  My favorite is the red one  Pimenton  which is a red pepper type sauce that is just great on everything  When coming here  you ve got to try a steak  whether it s a plate or it s a sandwich  you can t go wrong either way  Personally  I like the plate because you still get bread plus a small salad  However  the sandwiches are huge  The sides are also absolutely amazing  especially the Brussels sprouts    Overall  totally worth the hype  and wait  and it s not that expensive either  If there wasn t such a long line all the time  I d probably come here much more often than I do  I highly recommend Gaucho if you haven t already tried it out for yourself ,5,2016-03-04
So yummy    The best burgers in town for sure  Lots of flavor but not oily  The price is also affordable ,5,2014-09-14
We are here visiting Pittsburgh for a day and decided to give this place a try since a friend on FB recommended it  I ve got to say  seriously      this QuiQui Chicky is ridiculously addicting    I m actually writing this review while still licking my fingers  This a must try dish  We also ordered some Empanadas  which were very tasty  but this chicken dish     omg    ,5,2017-05-30
The prices were quite reasonable and the food very delectable  The empanadas were a little underwhelming the day after  Remember to bring your own drink if wanted ,4,2016-07-14
As a top rated spot in PGH I decided to finally give it a try   After reading about long lines and waits of up to an hour  I decided to order take out and go at lunch time  I called up to place my order and was told by a young woman that  we are very busy and might not be able to get to it   After picking my jaw up off the floor  I vowed I wouldn t go back   But after a few weeks of jonesing for the grilled veggies  I decided to give them one more try   This time a very pleasant young man took my order   Although there was a line of   people perusing the chalkboard menu  I got to scoot right up to the far side of the register  pay  and scoot right home  The grilled veggies were excellent  I also got a rosemary braised beef sandwich which was also very good  albeit a bit on the soggy side  even though I only live about    minutes away   Parking on Penn was a little tough  you might have to park a block or two away   They might want to consider getting a hold of the empty  but blocked off  lot next door ,4,2016-06-22
This place is terrific  For those of us who are unfamiliar with Argentinean food  the menu may require some explanation  The staff was very helpful in making recommendations  I wound up with the pulled chicken sandwich and grilled corn on the cob  Both were great  Although there is limited counter seating in the restaurant  there is a very nice outdoor patio   A great addition to the Strip   Will definitely be back ,5,2013-06-05
This place is heaven  Tried different cuts of meat and they were all delicious  Great environment and unique service ,5,2015-08-19
The food here is of really great quality and has great flavor  The biggest issue is the waiting to order and sit  We waited in line for over an hour  In this day and age  they should be able to have a system to text you when it s your turn to order so you can walk around and enjoy your evening  For this reason  we would not return even though the food was very good ,4,2018-09-02
This place is absolutely amazing  I ve lived in the Strip for a few months and it wasn t until just recently that I ate here for the first time  and I ve already gone back since     It s totally worth the   hour wait that extends out the door  So if you re starving and see the line  maybe opt for it some other time  The second time I went knowing there would be a long wait  so didn t show up hungry    I had  the chicken sandwich which was delicious and tried out the assortment of sauces they have on hand and I was very impressed by them all   It s also BYOB  so if you re in the long line it s wise to bring a cooler  We forgot and they let us put our beers in their fridge  so they are also great in terms of customer service ,5,2015-10-10
So delicious  We got the Provoletta and the Rosemary Braised Beef   melts in your mouth good  Can t wait to go back ,5,2018-07-11
Had been eager to try this place after seeing it be in the top     yelp restaurants  Even on a Tuesday night around       there was a line still to get in  Do not come at    because they lock the doors around         I had ordered the chicken wings and a small lamb chops  The wings were amazing and will definitely be back for them  They were marinated very well and had a great tangy flavor  It was five whole wings so it was good to split  The wings were so flavorful I didn t need to use any of the extra sauces    The lamb chops were also cooked well with a mustard seed dressing  The salad and tostado was a nice break from all the meat  My friend got the chicken and said it was fine but not great  a little dry  She preferred the wings over the chicken platter    Overall  I know I will be coming back  Simple food with great flavor ,5,2016-06-29
Great food  Meat Meat and Meat what s not to love  The staff was very friendly and helpful as the menu is overwhelming for a first timer  I would go back again anytime I return to Pittsburgh  I only wish I would have know it was BYOB ,5,2017-01-05
We had the opportunity to check out Gaucho Parilla late last summer  We were there with our two boys  age    and      My wife and younger son waited in line while my older son and I went to a local wine shop to grab an adult beverage for the meal  The staff at the restaurant was extremely friendly and helpful  The restaurant was packed but the staff never appeared flustered or made us feel rushed  We were seated and served fairly quickly  We ordered empanada appetizer main courses of beef  chicken and veggies  The food was fabulous and was the dining experience    We were so impressed that we recently reached out to the restaurant staff to help us with our family Christmas Day meal planning  We wanted to  mix things up a bit  for this German Polish family by switching the dinner to a traditional New Mexican theme    We wanted to include empanadas but did not feel confident preparing them ourselves  Gaucho enthusiastically helped us customize the empanada ingredients and offered their expertise regarding the best way for us to pick them up on Friday as we drove through Pittsburgh on our trip to Buffalo NY  They  par cooked the empanadas and packed them up for us  When I arrived at Gaucho to pick them up  the chef brought them out to me himself and took the time to give me his recommendations for completing the cooking process on Christmas Day  He also hand picked and packed up sauces for the empanadas  Very reasonable price    I was extremely impressed with the attention to detail demonstrated by all the staff  and the care they took to make sure their peice of our family dinner was a success  Our family meal was begun with the empanadas as I pulled them from the oven  They were golden brown and piping hot  The dough was perfectly flaky and the fillings were flavorful and moist  They really set the stage for the rest of the meal    Thanks so much to all the staff at Gaucho Parilla Argentina for the wonderful product you put on the table  the friendly and casual  atmosphere you create in your dining room and the obvious devotion you show to your customers    No wonder there s always such a long line of eager diners at their door  It s mostly definitely worth the wait ,5,2017-12-29
LOVE this restaurant   The food is always phenomenal and the employees are polite   The line gets pretty long at times but it is well worth the wait ,5,2016-05-15
The best  and only  argentinian cuts you can have in Pittsburgh  The flavor is amazing  the presentation subtle and the portions have the perfect size  If I could I would go there every week  The sandwiches are great but what really worth is having one of their amazing cuts  BYOB  Take your favorite red and enjoy ,5,2015-03-04
Our steak was overcooked but they gave us a new one immediately and it was perfect  Love their sauces  We also had the grilled chicken which was tasty  Will def be back for their paella ,5,2018-04-15
Very tasty foods  Both for the meat centric or a less heavily reliant  BOOB is nice  to let us choose the pairings  Friendly staff are there if you need em but unbothersome otherwise  The lineup is pretty much worth it  But from a managerial perspective  somewhat unavoidable  But its an asset to the institution that is probably a deliberate keeper to passively keep the hype  I ll play the game any day for food that tasty though  bravo ,4,2016-07-25
This is one of the BEST sandwiches I ve had  I came here after splitting a primanti brothers sandwich and we both agreed this was WAYYY better   The guy working here is super friendly and helpful  We even got to try a sample of soup for free  We split the  Carne  sandwich and I got the filet cut  several cuts of steak are available to you   It came out very moist and flavorful  Seasoned very well  must have been marinated i guess  and cooked on the grill it was great  It also came with some roasted peppers  If I lived here I d eat it all the time   HIGHLY RECOMMEND,5,2014-01-07
Went there feeling a bit adventurous and wanting to try something new and different  The line to order was a bit long so if you re in a hurry for to go  call ahead  I wanted to get a bit of everything so I got a steak empanada  chicken empanada  Gaucho Papas  and Tostados  The sauces were the best part  My personal favorites were the pimenton and the Cebolla  Also BYOB and no cork fee ,4,2015-09-17
Amazing    My new favorite go to restaurant   Just had the Pescado sandwich   potatoes  and corn   Everything was so delicious and fresh   True Argentina style cooking   All the sauces were delicious   fresh   Seating was limited during lunch but I enjoyed the casual atmosphere of pulling up a barstool and enjoying delicious food ,5,2014-01-23
I got lucky because when I arrived there was no line   That is unusual   This place is popular    Since I am not from the area and only travel here for work I haven t tried this place before   I am so glad I did   Wow     The carne  steak  sandwich was a tender cut of meat on a great piece of bread with saut ed red peppers and onions   Delish    Add one  or more  of their   home made sauces and even more delish   I also had a chicken and a beef empanada   They were also fantastic    I will be back ,4,2017-05-03
Had the flank steak sandwich   Very tender and tasty   Would definitely go there again ,4,2017-01-28
I have been waiting a long time to write this  The first thing I can say is  it was worth the wait  Walking down pen avenue toward the bridge the sweet smell of wood fire and grilling hits you about a block away  The line for lunch can be a bit long at times  but it moves pretty fast so don t give up  The chalk written menu is easy to follow  small plates  salads  main dishes specials and grilled beef and pork  For lunch I have been waiting to try the braised beef with rosemary and horsey sauce on a fresh focaccia  It was everything I could have imagined and more  The beef was tender and juicy and the rosary and grilled opinions were a perfect addition without hiding the flavor or the star of the show  I also had the pork empanadas which were the best I ve ever had    Period  I can t wait to try everything   My goal is the paella which serves     humans   I am sure I can find a few volunteers for that mission ,5,2016-03-26
Brought our son and his friend here for dinner before the Pirate game  When I looked at the menu I was worried the kids wouldn t like it  Boy was I wrong  they devoured everything on their plate  My husbands chicken sandwich was very good and my Rosemary braised beef sandwich was to die for   On top of the delicious food the staff were all so friendly and helpful  A most enjoyable dinner  The DeCarlo s will definitely be back ,5,2015-08-19
Fantastic    The smells emanating from this beautiful eatery are tempting enough   You step in and the decor is beautiful   The staff was friendly and helpful  as this was our first visit  won t be our last     We had the steak  filet   sandwiches  which were SO good   We also shared the Provoletta appetizer which was fantastic   The combination of provolone  toasted bread  arugula and Kalamata olives is just delicious    Every aspect of our lunch was so good   The ciabatta used for the sandwiches is perfect   I can t wait to try everything on the menu   Definitely an outstanding restaurant on the Strip  ,5,2015-12-16
Believe the hype    I ve only been in twice  both times with a line out the door  and most recently had one of the most deeply satisfying Filet con pan  sandwich  I can ever recall  along with a side of spicy caramelized brussel sprouts  I share the overwhelming love expressed for Gaucho ,5,2015-02-09
Went at      on a Friday   I was not in a hurry  but if you are call ahead   The place has some character to it which I really enjoyed   I got the steak sandwhich  ribeye    It was very good  as well as the ciabatta bread   I also got a side of the potatoes   They were slightly above average  as the rosemary was somewhat overpowering   I will be back again and will likely try them empanadas  sp   and a different cut of meet   I would give it     but they get the benefit of the doubt ,4,2016-01-09
Amazing   Amazing steak  amazing steak and amazing sauces   My rating is for the food   My review of everytthing else  There is very little seating  a surprise   and the seating there is  it is outside and uncovered   There must be room for eight people to sit inside and that includes      barstools at counters  It appeared that most of the customers get their food take out  There are no servers  really  although someone nice nice came to our table and delivered the food ,5,2014-07-31
Every bite is Awesome    Soooo Super Yummy  The roasted chicken and steak    Yummy  The mashed sweet potatoes and roasted red potatoes w  garlic sooo yummy ,5,2016-10-21
  of us went during the weekday lunch rush and we waited probably    minutes at most in line before we ordered and less than that to get our food once we sat down  The host serving staff was friendly efficient to take our order and seat us  The kitchen staff was extremely knowledgeable when we asked about different dishes  I had the Argentino salad with steak  medium rare and it was prepared to perfection  The   different sauces they offer are all equally delicious and different   The inside is clean  decorated well  and we love the yinzer vibe in there in addition to the authentic argentine feel      stars and more  Love everything ,5,2016-09-01
Absolutely delicious authentic tasting food  sauces are too die for  I get a salad or a sandwich and it s always amazingly delicious  Lots of things on the menu I have yet to try but I can imagine it s all good  It can form quite a line sometimes but it s worth the wait ,5,2017-10-21
This place is amazing and everything on the menu is excellent  However  the most cost efficent is the steak burger and always call in to skip the line ,5,2017-11-02
Holy Mary mother of sweet baby Jesus     Forgive me   One of the best mouth orgasms I ve ever had  If you love meat their steak sandwiches cannot  Be touched    Perfect quality perfectly toasted bread delicious accent veggies    I ordered a sandwich and the empanadas  I experienced food amnesia because the empanadas were so good I literally forgot I ate them both  In a matter of minutes    Don t walk here run now ,5,2015-05-03
The food is amazing  The atmosphere is nice   Friendly service from the moment we walked in   They explained the menu and gave great recommendations   I had the ribeye my friend got the flank steak and shared an order of grilled vegetables   Everything down to the grilled toast was some of the best food I ve had    I will definitely be back on my next trip to Pittsburgh ,5,2015-10-23
Came here specifically for the paella after the place had been recommended to me multiple times from multiple people  Not sure if it s because of the high praise or if they were having an off day but I was sincerely let down  I felt pretty uncomfortable from the getgo   as if I was judged to be not  hip  enough to be eating there  While ordering I asked for no chorizo on the paella and was asked if I wanted to substitute it for either tilapia or salmon  Neither sounded particularly appetizing so I opted for neither  The dude handling the order gave me a raised eyebrow look but proceeded in taking the order  While walking away to our table I turned back and overheard one of the cooks talking to the guy to reconfirm our order and seemed rather frustrated by my request  The place itself was rather hot and the music pretty loud  music selection however was    Other than that   everything was otherwise clean  aesthetically pleasing  and the wait staff refilled our waters appropriately    The paella itself was pretty lacking  There was no rice crust on the bottom  which felt sacrilegious  The shrimp on top were fresh and good quality but didn t have much flavor  nor did the rice  I know I asked for no chorizo but I didn t realize that they were incapable of imparting any flavor without it  Such a let down    It being my first time there and not wanting to waste food  I asked one of the wait staff for a box and he pointed to the front room and said boxes were available in that vicinity   tbh I didn t really hear exactly where the boxes were because he turned his head to that direction while speaking and I felt too uncomfortable to ask him to repeat himself  My date ventured off to find the boxes and was only able to find tiny boxes   definitely not big enough to fill with absurd amount of rice we now had for the week  As a side note   the paella is noted to be big enough for     people  I knew this while ordering and it does not negatively impact my feelings on the food restaurant itself  Luckily another wait staff member saw our tiny box dilemma and brought us two normal sized boxes which I was grateful for  He was also the only member who seemed genuinely courteous and professional as I watched him interact with other patrons  Also not really part of the review since it s not that kind of restaurant but I figured I d mention it    Overall  I was left unimpressed and probably won t return  Other people s food looked pretty good but I can only comment on my experience  If anyone reading is feeling daring and wants to try the paella for themselves I would recommend bringing some adobo along ,2,2018-06-04
Not from Pittsburgh but I have heard a lot of great things about the place so I knew I had to check it out  Turns out to be well worth the hype and the wait  A    minute wait to order during lunch   I couldn t make up my mind on what I wanted so I got the beef empanadas and the spicy chorizo sausage with toast   The empanadas were filled very well and crispy with a lot of flavor packed in  Definitely something I would be getting again and among the best empanadas I ve ever had   The spicy chorizo didn t feel too hot at first but it had great late kick to it and was exactly what I was hoping for    They had a bunch of other things on the menu that I would like to try another time  so I can guarantee that I ll be back on my next trip into town ,5,2017-02-24
Amazing  A Pittsburgh favorite and must try  Love the food here  Genuine wood fired in an open faced kitchen so you can see where the magic happens  Some of the tastiest meats and sides I ve ever had  They DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS  so be prepared for lines around the block    even in inclement weather  It s BYOB too    I like to bring a nice bottle of Argentinian Malbec  Always a must visit spot to bring guests from out of town  Has a young  hip vibe to it  freshly renovated space  loud  robust atmosphere  nothing fancy  Low key and relaxed but the food easily rivals some of the higher price point restaurants in the city  GO TO GAUCHO  You won t regret it ,5,2018-06-01
Are you like me that you want to save your last bite for your favorite food  That s impossible here  Everything is perfect  I was working on the roasted potatoes  ribeye  and sour dough bread at the end of my meal and it was impossible  Come eat here  You won t be disappointed ,5,2015-09-16
This place has the best food in Pittsburgh  Hands down  I would even put my hands back up again  so I can hands down again  Whether you are visiting or a burgher in the flesh  GO TO GAUCHO NOW    I am blown away by Gaucho and their incredible food  We walked in intending to eat in there but its not big enough for that  We took it over to the Beer Market in the North Shore and just raved about every bite  We all got sandwiches and since there were   of us all ordering different items on the menu  I can say I tried a lot of them  I couldn t tell which one I loved the best  I think   are tied for first  Is that possible   The sandwiches were filling but we also got some potatoes and veggies  Potatoes were a little underdone  but the veggies were perfect ,5,2015-01-26
Food is awesome at this place   The toughest part about it is sometimes they get super busy and the wait time can get pretty long   I ve been a couple of times for lunch during off hours and got right in though   The flank steak is incredible and I love all the different sauce options ,5,2019-07-09
Always a wait and with good reason  I went for lunch and had the rosemary braised beef sandwich which was quite a lot with fresh ciabatta bread  excellent  We started with empanadas which had a nice crusty shell  These were tasty  We split a side of the roasted potatoes which were well prepared and quite a large side  The sandwiches are quite large and probably could be split between   people  The service was very good and we left very happy  Highly recommended ,5,2018-05-15
Absolutely fantastic and satisfying food  Options for vegetarians as well as all the carnivorous delights  The seating situation is a bit frustrating but it s a popular restaurant for a reason and to be expected ,5,2016-06-19
THE Question to ask yourself at this place is  does the good food make up for the Mean Nazi like seating system that requires customers to wait outside in    degree temps   and don t block the effing  entrance  versus being seated in any of the abundant empty tables    The old man acting bossy boss was downright rude from the moment I walked in   How bout kindly saying  hey  do you mind sitting at a bar stool till your food is ready   I m seating people who have gotten food already in these tables     my spouse was in line ordering instead he was aggressive and rude  Stupid system and mean customer service   Rudeness can easily outweigh good food   Answer   not worth it,1,2016-12-16
Ate here for lunch a month back  Got there right when it opened  And good thing  the line when we left was out the door  I would say its worth the wait  One of the best sandwiches I ve had  maybe the best  And the chimichurri is AWESOME    ,5,2016-07-22
I love steak and Gaucho is a great place for it  We shared the Asado Platter    pieces of Empanadas  and the Veggie Plate between   of us  This was the perfect amount and we were all decently full after the meal despite getting HUNGRY from the wait  We came at around  pm on a Friday and had to wait about    minutes before we could put in our order and be seated   The steak was very flavorful and came perfectly medium rare as we had requested  If anything  some of the pieces were more on the raw side  which I didn t mind but some people might  I loved that I was able to try all the different cuts  and since all   of us had different favorites  I was able to get a few pieces of my favorite cuts   The empanadas weren t bursting with flavor but they were tasty in a homey way  especially the pastry part  For      I expected the Veggie Plate to be a bit bigger  but the vegetables were delicious  My friend who normally dislikes veggies became a veggie monster   Gaucho is a good place to have a bit of good steak for a decent price and still have enough left in your budget to get a little bit of something else  I can see myself coming back next time I m in the area ,4,2019-05-21
My friend and I were looking for a fun  ethnic restaurant in Pittsburgh  We spotted this place and although we had to wait outside in the long line  all of the food that we tried was definitely worth the wait  The chimichurri sauce was some of the best I ve ever had  The meat was so well cooked and everything that we tasted was amazing  I can t wait to go back ,5,2016-08-19
Ahhhhhhmazing  I was out with some people at the history center and we all caught the hungry train so we jetted down to the strip and snuck into this place  It was crowded but the smells coming out of the kitchen were worth the rather quick wait to the register to order  There were five of us there so one person ran outside by the place to secure a spot to sit so by the time we all ordered we had enough chairs to sit down and enjoy  I got the carne sandwich with lomo and it was more than enough to fulfill my dreams  I enjoyed every bite and intend to go back to try the rest of the menu  Highly recommend ,5,2014-04-12
Super fresh tasting food  BYO  Order at counter  Vibe of restaurant is laid back  unrushed  I d check menu before hand  Lots to choose from and hard to decide at a counter when you re in a line with people waiting behind you  The chimmi sauces are really clean and fresh tasting  Got the Gaucho salad and had some toast and broccolini   Even though there s a lot of meat on menu  you can go all veggie and be super satisfied ,5,2018-04-03
Wow   I ve never had anything like this  so delicious  I got the Carne sandwich with flank steak and it was so flavorful  The atmosphere was really cool and the employees were really helpful in pointing out their recommendations which ensured this great meal  My husband got the rosemary braised beef sandwich and it was so good too  We re not sure whose sandwich was better  but boy did they hit the spot on a cold day ,5,2018-11-10
I ve had this place a few times but the way my mom and aunt talked about me yesterday you d think I was a pro  I knew every answer to their questions  first timers always have questions lol  yesterday my mom and I split the ribeye steak  medium well  the pork chop  well done  the roasted potatoes with rosemary and the summer squash with breadcrumbs  The steak was flavorful and tender but it had parts that were a little too pink in certain areas and in other areas had too much char for me but in general it was a tasty steak   I got the bone part of the chop and loved it  it was juicy and delicious while my mom s main part was a little on the dryer but still tender  The squash was perfectly cooked and the bread crumbs on top were garlicky  which I like and crunchy  The potatoes could have been a little hotter because we asked for a side of butter and the butter wasn t really melting but not a big deal  I work at a hotel downtown and suggest it to anyone who will  listen    Long story short this place is worth the line you ll probably have to wait in to eat so go early and try the sauces they are all FABULOUS ,4,2019-05-15
Long wait and they don t serve wine  there   Website does not mention this    If you don t know it s BYOB then you re wine less in an Argentine  restaurant which  in Argentina would never be acceptable   Writing this for FYI for future customers ,2,2016-08-12
Got the lomo con pan  filet beef sandwich   Meat was like red bubblegum  Way too much fat  Couldn t eat it at all  The charm was definitely lost during the renovations  Service was pleasant ,2,2015-08-29
Best food in Pittsburgh  Their steak sandwiches are awesome and totally worth the price  Also  they recently expanded the size of the restaurant so it can fit more people ,5,2015-11-13
GREAT    Be prepared to wait there is always a line which speaks to how good the food is ,5,2016-06-09
Fives all around  Great price  great food  byob  Can t beat that  They keep the crowd moving  Be sure to try the rosemary beef sandwich ,5,2019-03-21
My boyfriend and I had been trying to go to Gaucho for the longest time  but the line was always out the door and down the side of the building  But recently  we found out why  We went on a Saturday around      or so  There was a wait but it was completely reasonable  I think we waited    minutes tops  The staff was communicative to the crowd  stating they were waiting for more tables to open up before they seated other customers    We got up to order our food and I ordered the chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the pulled pork  We also got some empanadas to try  We sat at a table and decided to try out some of the sauces they had before our food came  The red pepper sauce is to die for  we actually took some home because we liked it so much  When our food came  we couldn t eat it fast enough  I added avocado to the chicken sandwich and it went perfectly with everything on the sandwich  The portions were huge and we were both full after each eating a half of a sandwich  As for the empandas  they were fantastic and a must have  I tried the veggie one which had goat cheese in it  The goat cheese was a nice addition and added freshness  I highly recommend a visit to Gaucho  I will be returning soon   ,5,2019-02-16
Must eat in Pittsburgh  I brought all my friends who visited Pittsburgh for the first time here and they all love it  My go to is the steak platter and empanadas ,5,2019-04-20
Wow  Now I understand all the five star reviews  If you ve ever taken a bite out of a steak sandwich  and the whole thing came out  you ll appreciate the sandwiches at Gauchos    I had the Carne con Pan with the Ribeye steak  pictured in front  Hubby had the Braised Beef with horsey sauce  pictured in the back of my photo    Hubby also went back for a second ear of corn  it was that good    Definitely recommend  And I ll most certainly be back ,5,2015-07-02
Just what this place needs    another   star review   What can I say   The people working are super nice and sweet The meat is out of this world incredible The sauces make you melt The bread is squishy and chewy and full of flavor The veggies are crisp and grilled to perfection  Believe the hype   Go there now ,5,2014-09-17
The food was very average   I felt like I spent way too much on something that I could have prepared better at home  On our way out the door we noticed that it smelled like a dirty mop  It was just not worth the money or the trip ,1,2017-03-20
I have eaten here several times since moving to Pittsburgh last summer  and it never fails to disappoint  Hands down my favorite go to restaurant for bringing friends visiting from out of town  and also one I ll readily recommend to anyone asking for a new place to try  The concept is pretty simple  Argentinian style restaurant where pretty much everything is grilled  You can t go wrong with a classic steak plate  you choose the cut  they ll cook it to your preference  and it comes with chimichurri  salad  and grilled bread  The additional sides they offer are often changing  but always to die for  My favorite as of late are the roasted potatoes and garlic  those cloves are cooked to perfection and I could eat them all day  garlic breath included   and the honey glazed carrots with goat cheese  They also offer some fun traditional desserts  Thankfully most of their stuff is naturally gluten free  and I usually get a steak plate without the grilled bread  It may seem expensive at first glance  but I guarantee it is      worth it ,5,2019-04-25
I had an high expectation when I visited Gaucho   However  I was kind of disappointed with their seating and waiting system   I have nothing to say about their food    The food was amazing but seating was confusing   I hope they improve their system ,3,2016-04-08
I waited in line on a Saturday for no less than    minutes  I waited no less than    minutes afterwards for my two platters and sandwiches  We ate outside in    degree weather  And I m STILL giving them   stars  This food is great  Load up on sauces and enjoy ,5,2015-02-15
What can I say  Gaucho is amazing  You re going to have to wait in line  but that s a given and it s well worth it  My best suggestion is to go at an  off  time  for both of my Gaucho experiences I ve arrived around   or   in the afternoon and the line is pretty manageable    You can t go wrong with the steak plates  which come in small    oz  or large     oz   They come with a Gaucho salad and bread  The steak sandwich is also amazing if you re in the mood for a sandwich  You can pile the sandwich up with just about any topping you d like  Additionally  they do different empanadas daily  we tried the chicken and they were pretty yummy    After getting seated and while waiting for your food  load up on all of the sauces  They re all delicious in their own way  but the chimi is my go to  By the time you have your sauces  your food will arrive  It s crazy fast  which is great after waiting in a long line of anticipation    The only thing I noticed is their meat is a bit under cooked  I always order a medium steak  but at Gaucho I would go with a medium well just to make sure the meat isn t too red    Another win for Gaucho is their food truck Asado which can be found at popular breweries in the area throughout the week ,5,2017-11-05
I m not sure what the hype is about this restaurant  It s crazy to wait in line forever in the cold  Food was average  nothing out of the blue   definitely NOT worth the wait   Food      Service      Ambience     ,3,2016-12-14
Truly incredible food   Any of their meat dishes are excellent  The newly remodeled and re opened space is beautiful and allows for indoor seating ,5,2015-06-30
Perfect   Friendly atmosphere and just top notch food   The steak sandwich  the camerones  the grilled vegetables  etc   The best I can say about it is that I am so torn between wanting to tell the world about this place and wanting to keep it my little secret   Highly recommended ,5,2013-05-03
The food is sooo good  I just wish the restaurant was different  they don t take reservations  don t have waiters  you have to get your own plates and silverware    It makes things so complicated  Also  since the place is so popular you might end up having to stand outside for an hour or more just to eat  It s just too complicated  I want to have a nice dinner  not a stressful one which is what I get after standing outside in line and having to serve myself ,2,2016-07-24
Everything is great  Just be warned that the lamb dinner is three scrumptious but tiny medallions  You will be left chewing the bones for more food ,5,2015-08-04
Best place in the Burgh by far  Food is amazing and the flavor is just as good  if not better  than the restaurants I visited in Argentina   Not only is the food great  the staff is awesome as well  If you haven t tried it yet  this one is must visit ,5,2015-03-31
After attending CMU from            I was not expecting to find a place like Gaucho   Maybe I matured past bar food  maybe Pixburgh has really stepped into its own  or maybe a combination of both   Any which way  this is a must stop destination after you get in your obligatory run through Primanti s   My gf and I ordered the asado platter  all five cuts of steak    there was no way we were going to limit ourselves to a couple cuts   We also got empanadas  a side of grits  and a side of greens   Obviously the steak was the best part of the meal   Very cool experience to taste the subtle differences and textures between the different cuts   highly recommend   Also  gotta love the bread on top   The grits and greens were standard  not a must order but you will want some type of flavor break from the mound of meat   The empanadas were good  but ultimately it s hard for anything to hold a candle to the steak ,5,2019-07-16
The food was absolutely outstanding  We had the pork chops  shrimp   empanada   and meat and cheese plate   Probably in the top ten places I have eaten    This place really makes fine dining accessible   We will be back again       tomorrow,5,2018-01-04
Good food  My hubby and I got ourselves some steak me flanks and him ribeye  The sauces were so good  We had to order extra toasts because we can stop dipping on them  Will def eat again ,4,2019-01-23
Some of the best food you can get in Pittsburgh  They often have great desserts too  You can t go wrong with any dish  paella  chicken  steak  potatoes  it s all good  The portions are also pretty large  we always go home with leftovers  The staff are always friendly and energetic  Of course  this is a busy place  but if you plan to go on a weekday evening it s not as bad and the wait isn t too long ,5,2019-01-25
Unbelievably good  We ll definitely be coming back   Ordered the Rosemary Braised Beef Sandwich as well as some Empanadas ,5,2018-12-28
This my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh  I m so sad that i didn t know it the time I moved here,5,2015-12-02
I would eat here daily if I lived here   It was incredible   Try the corn when in season  And BYOM  Bring Your Own Malbec    I had the flank steak salad and it was KILLER   The bacon on my date s BLT was smoked on that magic grill to perfection   Happiness ensued ,5,2013-07-11
I REALLY did not want to like this place      The line was long and we had to wait outside   I thought it was strange you ordered and paid before you sat down    But I LOVED IT   The food  wow  the food   amazing  Gotta go with the meat   My girlfriend and I split the large sirloin   I definitely recommend getting it medium   It is served with toast  salad  and a steak sauce   Delicious is an understatement   The meat is tender  and that portion alone was massive     We also split an order of the wings   The wings were huge  as they were five full wings     total    I recommend using their homenade sauces on top of them  as they can be a bit crispy  not quite burnt   Then we each had a chicken empanada  which if you put their homemade garlic sauce on   epic    My girlfriend and I are the type who like to leave a restaurant full  and typically finish everything on our plates   Here  we had leftovers  just to give an idea of how much food it really is     All that food was just       ONLY       Finally  we heard amazing things about their dessert  so we had to indulge   We split the cheesecake   Best dessert I have had in a long  long time     So  even though I REALLY wanted to hate this place  I ended up loving it   Keep in mind  my girlfriend and I went at      on a Wednesday and still did not get our food until       I cannot imagine what the line is like on a weekend ,4,2016-09-15
Love this place  Last time was there had a spicy chorizo sandwich and red potatoes  Sauces were all great atmosphere is great and it s incredibly close to home  I get confused as to if it s more like a serve yourself restaurant or a full service  However this doesn t dampen the food  If you like meat or you just like great food in general  go here ,5,2017-06-05
Definitely a   star restaurant   The line went quick and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable on the menu   The steak was well seasoned and cooked to perfection   The salad and potatoes were a perfect side and the right amount   I will return to try this place for dinner ,5,2016-03-23
After reading about how great his restaurant was  my girlfriend and I went here and have been making it a monthly destination since   While the seating situation isn t really optimal  the quality of food and the attitude of the people working there really makes up for it   There s something great about having an expertly cooked steak sandwich while you smell the wood that they use to fire their grills   The food is a little on the expensive side  but as long as you can get a seat it s definitely worth it to come here   I d recommend coming a bit off of normal eating hours since it quickly gets mobbed on the weekends ,5,2014-08-23
This place is overrated  My steak sandwich was burnt  The vietnamese restaurant nearby has better sandwich ,3,2016-06-19
I read a lot of hype about this place so we decided to check it out   The line was extremely long  wrapping around the building   It was over an hour wait just to get in the front door      I was told they would like for us to be seated outside on a patio area next door to their business building   They told us it had nothing to do with us having a service dog  however with a line wrapped around the building  nobody else occupying several tables on the patio except for us  it did seem that way     We specifically asked when putting our order in at the front counter if we should order extra sodas now or if someone would be by to refill our drinks on the patio   They assured us that someone would be by to check on us and refill drinks   That didn t happen  nobody checked on us once  while our drinks sat empty     The food was mediocre   I didn t think the meat was great quality and was sorta blah in taste   One of the slices of meat was undercooked for  medium    The potatoes and the corn were just ok   I wasn t wow ed and probably wouldn t wait that long to eat here again ,2,2018-09-28
The reviews on here are all true  This restaurant is authentic  warm  welcoming and so tasty   I was so satisfied with everything we had  The ribeye sandwich was juicy  flavorful and so easy to eat  The corn on the cob was the best I have ever had   The different sauces were amazing  I would eat here every month if I could  Too bad we live out of state ,5,2015-07-04
Food was great and worthy of all the   star reviews  We ordered an assortment of meats and sides which really hit the spot  My party also made good timing  arrived on a Friday at   pm  and ordered seated relatively quickly  When we left at  pm  the line was out the door ,5,2017-04-23
Delicious food  quick service and reasonable prices  Such an amazing find  I m glad the doctor  not to be mistaken for The Doctor that travels through time and space  though with a new regeneration cycle  it s maybe possible that it was him recommended this place  Do not miss out  seriously  go eat there now  you won t regret it ,5,2015-07-16
Gaucho is THE place to go when you have friends in town  It s a bit salty and greasy  but still  who can resist Gaucho,5,2015-12-05
The ribeye was outrageously good  Chicken wings were huge  juicy and generously seasoned  The toasted bread was awesome  The dipping sauces were all amazing   tried all   of them  The saffron rice was very tasty  It did seem odd that the salad didn t come with anything on top  Was I supposed to dress it    Even though it s a self serve place  the employees kept coming by and checking in  Felt very welcome and attended to  So the service was great   The upper room is nicer but the first room is fun too  to see the action at the register   I was only not impressed with the dessert  The creme br l e with a dollop of butterscotch and a few fruits  Not very good at all  but the other stuff was so mind blowing  I can see all why all the fuss    Luckily got there before   because the line was out the door for the rest of the evening  even on a terribly rainy day ,5,2016-03-18
Get anything on the menu  it will be great  If you hate the line  call ahead and order for takeout ,5,2018-06-22
I don t eat steak  but I ate this steak and I loved it   The sandwich was flavorful and delicious   The kind of sandwich that you eat without putting down once   The only downside was how small the place was   I was able to get their early and have a seat but most people had to have their sandwich to go   The small size says nothing to the flavor of the sandwich was was HUGE and fantastic  highly reccomend ,4,2015-04-15
We went here on a Saturday afternoon  We had to wait about    minutes to order  which wasn t too bad  I like the set up of ordering first and being given beverages at the front counter before you re seated  It s pretty efficient  However  given that there aren t actual servers I would expect the place to be a little cleaner  I realize it was super busy  but we had to  clean  off our own table using a napkin  Seating is limited and first come first serve  I can t imagine trying to eat here with a party bigger than     people  Next time  I d order food to go  instead of eating on top of someone else s food remains  I m generally not picky about a few left behind crumbs  but this was particularly messy and there was also garbage on the floor  On a positive note  the carne sandwiches were fantastic and perfectly cooked to our liking  We got the flank sandwich and the New York Strip sandwich  We preferred the flank since the Strip was a little harder to eat on a sandwich and had a lot of fat  We also got an order of papas  which were okay  There wasn t really anything special about them  I really liked the different self serve sauces   I ll definitely be returning for sandwiches to go ,4,2015-12-08
One star off because I m jealous there s not one in Los Angeles   Community and fresh  organic food   I must now make more friends in Pittsburg so I can hangout here   Super sad   I just ate Patty s before I got here  so just to accompany my co worker who was running late   So I snacked on a simple beef  delicious  empanada  while he had their recommend sandwich   Needless to say on his first bite the look in his eyes was a  whoa  then the next bites that proceeded was of pure joy   This is the reason main reason to come to town ,4,2016-04-02
I m a huge fan of Gaucho and it s super easy to give them   stars   The quality of the food is consistently awesome  Some of my favorites include the flank steak  humita  foccacia  the rosemary braised beef sandwich  seafood stew  grilled corn on the cob  the shrimp    honestly  I ve never had a dish here that I didn t think was delicious  I love that the menu changes seasonally and combines familiar items with more adventurous ones    This place is so fun for a family style meal with a nice bottle or two of wine  BYOB  because you re going to be eating off each other s plates anyway   The steak temperature can be somewhat inconsistent  I started ordering it rare after having a few instances where only the center piece of my steak serving was actually at medium rare  but then ended up with an order of steak that was definitely the Pittsburgh definition of rare  Regardless of this  the steak is always  always delicious and I would probably eat it even if it showed up in a near charcoal state  which it doesn t    As you can see by other reviews  plenty of people are thrown by the ordering seating strategy at Gaucho  There s really nothing wrong with it unless your expectations are a traditional  server runs to my table for every little thing  restaurant  in which case  you should give Gaucho a try when you re feeling a little more independent  At Gaucho  you line up near the door and in front of a huge blackboard menu to order  then seat yourself in the dining area  When your meal is ready  they will bring the food out to you  The line can get very long and there can be some competition for seating during busy times  so I definitely suggest you make your first visit at an off time to really enjoy the experience  Still  we have NEVER failed to get a table and enjoy our meal  The staff are super friendly  helpful  and they really do circulate and make sure you have what you need ,5,2016-09-10
Maybe age is making me a bit slow with discovering good food places  I don t know how I only just recently found out about this AMAZING tiny restaurant  After eating there  I actually went on Food Network hoping to find a place to recommend this place to Guy s Diners  Drive Ins  Dives   Unfortunately  I didn t find it    But this place is MOST DEFINITELY Food Network Feature Worthy   Does that say how good this place is yet    Writing this review makes me drool     All of their sandwiches are amazing  if you are a steak lover  you can choose what kind of steak to use for your sandwiches   The chicken and the veggies sandwiches are also really tasty  As a meat lover  I still find the veggie sandwich amazing  The salads they offer are equally as good  When I am in the mood to eat slightly healthy  I go for the salad  The sides are also fun tasty  Just honestly  try all the food on their menu     They are currently under renovation  Can t wait for them to come back with their hopefully bigger space  The line is always out the door on weekends  it s definitely time to upgrade their space ,5,2015-05-13
Absolutely the best steak and chicken sandwiches that I ve ever had anywhere  Great grill flavor ,5,2015-01-22
The food is excellent and I am so happy about the expanded seating area     I love this place   I ve never had a bad meal ,5,2015-09-01
Stopped by at about  pm on a Saturday and only waited for a few minutes   Ribeye steak was delicious as well as the beef empanada  One of the best meals I ve had in Pittsburgh ,5,2017-08-02
The wait kinda sucked       hour wait   but totally worth it the food was freakin amazing   Next time  I ll bring a six pack for the wait  Believe the hype  ,5,2016-05-20
Very different restaurant from   years ago  Did enjoyed it tremendously most recently  Restaurant has changed  Bigger more ample seating  Highly recommended  It is worth the wait ,5,2016-06-26
Hands down the best steak sandwich I ve ever eaten and I travel coast to coast and consider myself a foodie  I got the ribeye and it   along with the sauces  were amazing ,5,2015-01-20
Food is amazing   The meats are incredible and the sandwiches are outta this world   However I do hate the lines ,5,2018-03-21
STELLAR  AWESOME  FANTASTICO   Yeah  that s pretty much how we feel about Gaucho   Just like our experience with Cure  the approach to the restaurant sets the stage for a great meal  since the wonderful smell of open fire grilling will set your tastebuds into a frenzy  All of their items we ordered were nothing short of stupendously delicious and of the highest quality  Here s what we had      Empanadas   honestly  I don t know how you could even consider NOT ordering empanadas if you set foot into an Argentine eatery   shame on you if you didn t order these  They are wonderful  and are definitely the best I ve ever had    even in Argentina      Provoletta   Again  this is an authentic classic  If you don t order this  you should be committed to the insane asylum  Delicious  Comes with a very tasty arugula and lemon vinaigrette side salad  A nice option for a small bite for lunch      Two filet sandwiches   These are huge  On our next visit  we are only going to order one and split it  but this time  we just took the extra one home and wolfed it down the next day   I was instantaneously addicted to this place  and will definitely be back in the near future  Love it  love it  love it ,5,2013-09-20
I am definitely in love with this place and enjoyed our dinner there  I would give it five stars if it was more of a sit down restaurant as I struggle with a place where you have to order at the counter and serve yourself things like the silverware and sauce   We ordered a TON of food  empanadas  cheese appetizer  flank steak  ribeye  shrimp  pork  corn  rice  and potatoes  and it was a little over        that is a deal in my book   All the meets were incredible and the corn pudding was out of this world  The sauces are all good as well and between our group we couldn t agree on a favorite  everyone liked a different one and ultimately they were all good and complimented the meats differently   We found a nearby wine shop where we could buy a bottle of wine as it is BYOB   Also  I am sure this sounds crazy but the toasted bread that went along with every dish was SO good  Perfectly grilled and loaded with butter and seasoning   The grilled corn was so good my daughter ordered a second cob after finishing the first   If they could find a way to better serve the meats when you order it family style that would be appreciated ,4,2016-07-05
The ecstatic reviews do not over hype this place   it is the best steak sandwich I have ever had    We didn t even know this place existed until we were walking down the street and saw a line out the door  Out of curiosity  we stepped up like sheep to see what treats could attract such a crowd  A line out the door always leaves me worried  but it moved pretty quickly  All in all  we were in line about    minutes before ordering  and it was another    before we got the food  It was absolutely worth the wait    We got   chicken empanadas and two steak sandwiches  one with flank steak and one with NY strip  I love that you can choose your steak  and they have   or   to choose from   The sandwiches come cooked fresh  on soft fresh bread  with delicious caramelized onions and roasted red peppers  The mix of flavors is phenomenal  and the juices from the steak are literally dripping off the sandwiches and getting soaked up by the bread  They also put a chimmi  don t call it chimmichurri  sauce on it that was real tasty and added to the wonderful complexity  There is a decent amount of seating in back  and despite the line  there was plenty of open space  If you re in town  do not skip it ,5,2015-08-21
As an Argentinean  I had the bar set pretty high for Gaucho  they did not disappoint  Each cut of meat is flavorful  tender and fresh  The chorizo is so satisfying  The simple salads provide a fresh pause in between bites  And the alfajores satisfy your sweet tooth to close the meal  The one thing I missed  flan and churros     Hoping they expand soon  The line can get pretty long around dinner time ,5,2018-02-12
Yum yum yum  I love some good sandwiches   Took a random day trip to Pittsburgh and was searching for a place to meet up with an old friend for lunch  After seeing the hundreds of reviews for this place  we had to check it out   We were able to find parking right down the street from the restaurant  I was a little scared that the line would be one of those agonizing  way too long lines  where your stomach just hurts from being too hungry       but at      pm on a sunny Saturday afternoon  we only stood in line for    minutes  Quite impressive in my opinion  I had read one review that stated that you would wait in line for one hour     but it moved along at a decent pace  in my opinion   Essentially  you order at the cashier  and then you sit down  waiting for your food to be brought out  The whole process actually moves quite fast  Perhaps because people realize there are others waiting in line    I m not sure  but the rate of people eating  then leaving behind seats for others who are coming in  is quite fluid  It was actually very impressive   Anyways  I decided on the carne sandwich  On the chalkboard menu  it stated   choice of vaca   which we then had to google translate  and for those who are interested  it means beef  I chose the arrechera  cooked medium  The others chose the rosemary braised beef   We sat down in a midst of people eating their big sandwiches or big ears of corn  Now this is my kind of place  I thought    Results    My arrechera sandwich  DELICIOUS  First  the meat was very tender and flavorful  It was cooked a perfect medium  almost more to a medium rare  however  I probably should have had it cooked more  so I wouldn t have to chew so hard to break it down  Nonetheless  the flank was good  And the BREAD it came on  Wow  that s good bread  a little bit of garlic in it  but just so fluffy and tasty     a good bread really makes a sandwich    Their rosemary braised beef  apparently  this beef cooks for   hours before they serve it to you   and you can tell  Their instant responses after biting into the sandwiches were   MmmmmMMMMMM      The meat was so moist and tender  that was a good sandwich  On top of it  the bread again  was a stellar winner   Definitely make a stop at this place if you re in the area  It s reallllly tasty ,5,2016-05-08
Absolutely fantastic  Charming atmosphere  excellent steak  clever menu that honestly almost made me assume the place was too gimmicky  But I asked a local and they raved about it  Got there around noon on a Saturday which turned out to be  just  in time  The line was out the door about    minutes after we showed up  Three of us split the Asado platter and chorizo sandwich with a small side  and didn t even get through that  Well worth the entirely reasonable price ,5,2018-03-24
OMG  the meat is to die for  never have I had meat taste this good  I dream of the meat here  never tasted so good  can t wait to return  don t care if there is a line out the door  I will wait in line to savor the food  I m salivating right now just thinking about it ,5,2015-08-07
I don t always eat meat  but when I do  I prefer Gaucho     Stay hungry  my friend ,5,2014-01-07
Best food in city to pair with wine  Go early to avoid line  Steak is out if this world ,5,2018-02-02
This is easily the best food I have ever had in my entire life   A lingering warmth is left behind for hours after I eat here   Seriously  that does happen   The cost is more than reasonable with this quality and quantity   I have eaten a variety of dishes but my standby is the Rosemary Braised Beef sandwich   Eating any other sandwich anywhere else at this point is blasphemy ,5,2016-02-12
It basically doesn t matter what you order  I can guarantee it ll be delicious  As soon as you get within a couple blocks of the place  your mouth will start watering as you smell the smoke and cooking meat ,5,2017-02-17
This argentine steakhouse does a fantastic job at guess what  Grilling steaks  The prices are fair  even a little cheap  and  drum roll  it s byob with no corking fee  The empanadas were so so  but my salad and arrachera  flank steak  were great ,5,2015-07-05
This is by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh   You have to try the amazing grilled meats here   I ordered the sampler of   different types of steak   The Sirloin was my favorite   They have   different types of homemade  authentic Argentinian sauces   The red sauce and the chimichurri were my favorite   They are BYOB  so bring a bottle of wine and try their food   You will be back ,5,2017-11-26
A little tough to find and not a lot of parking around and not much for seating but the food was delicious  Plenty of options on the blackboard and everything seemed to be freshly prepared  I can t remember what I had but it was great and I d be glad to go back and try something new ,5,2016-05-09
BYOB   Take note   BYOB  I didn t and expected to buy a bottle of wine   but that in no way took away from the awesome food  From the second you enter the place you are greeted with a olfactory sensory overload of perfectly seasoned seared steak  The eclectic staff is happy to walk you through the menu and help you chose from many fantastically flavored selections from fish to steak  chorizo to empanadas  chicken to grilled veggies  sandwiches to salads   unless of course you already know what you want like we did  Have the Rack of Lamb and any Steak dish and you won t be sorry   and this isn t Aunt Pookies  lamby  Sunday Mutton  this is delicately french boned deliciousness cooked to perfection  I promise  you ll leave satisfied while planning your next visit and with whom you re going to introduce to the Argentinean food fantasy ,5,2015-07-29
Great Steaks  pork chops  chicken  basically any protein you can think of that can be grilled  cooked over a open wood grill  you just can t beat this quality of food for     of the price of your high end steak house  The Provoletta is great and a must try as well  if your in the strip  stop at Gaucho and grab a sandwich or steak  you won t be disappointed ,5,2018-05-09
This was the best meal in my life  Really  I consider myself a professional fat guy  and this place blew my mind ,5,2018-03-08
Always excellent  I remember when it was a small place but the renovation is nice with lots of searing  Great thing is that even when its a   hour wait  the food quality is still A   never had a bad meal here  Be sure to go on an off hour so you dont get caught in the lunch line  Other than that  friendly   awesome food ,5,2016-03-08
Definitely lives up to the hype   I ordered the steak sandwich  with a choice of steak meat  I got the filet    For     that s hard to beat  economically speaking  The portion was plenty for me for dinner  The ciabatta bread was very fresh and tasty  and the meat was seasoned and cooked as ordered  medium rare  The onions were nicely caramelized  and the peppers had a great char roasted flavor to them   A friend and I split sides of papas and some kind of corn dish  which complimented our meals well   There are several sauces  self serve  which you can add to your meal  I added some to both my sandwich and papas  I especially liked the red sauce   a tad of spice with a lot of flavor from all of the fresh herbs ,5,2015-06-26
It was our first time there yesterday  The food was absolutely amazing  I had the steak burger and my friend had the pork sandwich  Strongly recommend Gaucho  the staff is very helpful and friendly   We will definitely be back soon ,5,2016-09-07
This place deserves six stars   The rib eye  flank steak  strip  or any of the vaca plates are my go to  with sides of grilled veggies and papas  Perfectly cooked every time and their homemade sauce selections are excellent    Loved this place before the remodel and even more after   Only bad menu item we ve tried is the corn pudding ,5,2015-09-13
So delicious  Long lines move quickly  The staff is so friendly and fun  even play games with you while you wait  Great salsas to choose from and creative flavors ,5,2016-04-06
This food here is completely delicious   I ve been on gaucho land in the Argentine highlands and this is better  albeit far more expensive      I had the New York strip   oz and it was perfect caution the line to get in was loooooong and my brother told me it always is   On the bright side I arrived    minutes late while he waited in line      Sooooo I only had to stand in line like    minutes  p  Thanks bro   So what that means is if you have leg issues or something it might not be fir you to stand outside in the sun for that long   But if you do it s worth it  food is great ,5,2017-08-17
I haven t been back since the renovation  but have never been disappointed in the food   Hoping there s more seating than previously ,5,2016-02-28
Food is great   Service was good  Not a fan of the location   Not a place to take a date if you want to hear her speak   Order ahead and take the food home,4,2017-01-04
I wanted to love Gaucho based on everything I ve read  I didn t  I ll chalk it up to ordering the wrong thing   flank steak sandwich  requested rare and got meat I couldn t chew  I ve grilled flank steak to rare many times  always marinated to break down muscle fibers   so it surprised me to get a piece of meat that was resistant to my teeth  I ll probably try Gaucho again as everything on other diners  plates looked good  but will stay away from the flank or skirt steak options ,2,2017-06-01
Amazing  love the food quality and the presentation makes it phenom  Felt like a hipster with the crowd there LOL  but the food was worth the trip  Loved the environment and setup  an all around A  experience ,5,2015-09-17
I went  by this place when I was walking down to the Strip District in Pittsburgh  I wasn t sure what it was but there was a line all the way out the door and down the block  I found out It was a lot of local business people waiting to get in for lunch  An hour later I walked back by and the line had shortened somewhat  I decided I had to try it if that many local people were willing to wait  I then looked it up on Yelp and the ratings were fantastic  I had a steak sandwich with chimmichurri and it was fantastic  It is an Argentine type restaurant  The first place I have see fugazetta since Buenos Aires  This place is worth the wait  I looked at all the plates going by and they all looked fantastic  I m sorry I don t have room for the chocolate coconut bread pudding ,5,2016-04-15
Best steaks you can get for a semi affordable price  Meats are all very good  I recommend the sampler platter so you can get a taste for each type of meat  Seafood also does not disappoint either  the only reason I would give it   stars is because the food is a little too salty for me ,4,2018-09-17
Great food   worth the wait  We arrived at      on a Saturday night and waited in line for an hour     minutes of which was outside  We made friends with other people in line and started the party  We opened our wine  which made the time go faster  Bring cups and an opener  For our meal  the four of us shared everything  Universally  I d say that the smoky  charred flavor from the oven carried through deliciously across all dishes   Asado Platter   Fabulous  I would take a piece of the steak on the toast with some sauce   the red pepper was my favorite   Sprauhts   Perfection  Campfire Yams   Unexpected favorite  This was unbelievably sweat and delicious   Argentino Ensalada   Great balance to all of the meat we enjoyed   Empanadas  chicken and beef    The only disappointment  There was a lot of dough and wasn t all that flavorful  The next time we come  I would arrive earlier to avoid the line  Also  I would not get the Empanadas and instead try the chorizo or shrimp ,5,2016-01-31
Very tasty food and friendly service  You might be in for a wait for a table   but that s because it s delicious and well priced  Great casual ambiance  Excellent lunch spot ,4,2017-02-22
V good  You line up  order your food and you get seated  For us  the line started just outside the door but it still took us    minutes to get through the whole process  My friend and I shared the pulled pork    empanadas  the papas side  and the grilled shrimp  Everything was so delicious  The pulled pork was so juicy and flavorful  the papas were very soft and garlic y  and the shrimp had that wonderful charcoal slightly burnt taste  For the empanadas we got the chicken and the beef  Beef was alright  but the chicken was good  The dough was a bit dry though  We also shared the nutella crumble  I forget the exact name  but it was nutella bread pudding with a cookie crumble and hazelnuts  Kind of too sweet but really good  The staff is very nice and helpful during the ordering process and it s a good medium noise level so you can have fun with friends ,4,2016-11-29
Visited at  pm just as the lunch rush was leaving  Probably    people in line  Immediately greeted by a gentleman in line taking   of people in each party  The long line actually gives you time to browse the amazing menu wish so many choices  It s BYOB with no corkage fee but this was lunch  The guy filling drinks was helping people on what to order and showing pictures of meals on his  phone  As I was checking out the girl at the register was giving me tips about the place   You get your own silverware and sauces off the wall that was a first   Waiters and Servers stopped by several times to check on my drink even while this place is packed  Food was immaculate  People continued to check on my meal and refill my drink   Highly recommend to anyone,5,2016-12-20
Do NOT go at typical dining hours  I went around   and waited almost   hours and thought the food was overrated  There s nowhere to wait so you have to stand outside and wait in a line that wraps around the building  Didn t care for the atmosphere either and overall not sure why people like it as much as they do ,3,2016-08-07
This is a carnivores paradise  meat  meat and a side meat  Had a steak sandwich  which was surprising an overwhelming portion size for even a cave man like myself ,4,2016-04-27
Wonderful sandwich shop in with he Strip District  long lines but worth the wait  They also have wonderful salads and other foods   It is a very casual place with very friendly service and high quality flavorful food  Read the chalk board menu and be ready to order when you get to the register  They have nice seating inside and a funky patio outside but seats are limited   We started with pork empanadas that required no sauces  The crust was perfect combination of crispy outside and flaky just underneath  The salads were fresh  large and tasty   The star is the meat  We had sandwiches  The Carne is a pick your meat  filet  rib eye     and how cooked  rare  medium rare     on a nice bun with peppers and caramelized onions  They have a selection of tasty sauces to use as well   Thoroughly enjoyed it ,5,2017-09-21
Im on the bandwagon      im in the military and stopped here on my way to the airport  I was in uniform and the cashier literally pulled out his credit card and paid for my meal  Extremely unecessary  but i am unbelievably greatful  I got a strip steak sandwich to go so I didnt get to experience sitting down  but next time that will be happening  The crew members joked around with me and all seemed extremely pleasant  From a service standpoint definently a    out of    Lets get to the sandwich     the bread  So fresh so delicious just absolutely incredible  The steak  Cooked perfectly and again  delicious  The peppers and onions  They had some sort of sweet glaze or sauce with it  which blended perfectly  Oh my goodness  To say it was amazing is such a huge understatement  Im a big eater and the sandwich was enough to make me feel content  trust me     it took all my effort to not gorge myself to death of extra food        Anyways  please excuse me as i go take a food coma nap ,5,2017-04-20
It took me a long time to get to Gaucho  longer than I would have liked but the wait was well worth it and now with their expanded seating it makes it a bit easier to get a spot  unless It s a weekend then it s every person for themselves  but regardless once you get a spot the food is incredible  The flank steak is my favorite for sure but I really don t think you can go wrong on your choice  The staff also seem to truly enjoy what they are doing and are extremely kind  Now I just need to figure out when I m going back next ,5,2015-10-11
Best lunch spot in Pittsburgh   For those of us who don t eat a ton of of meat  especially red meat  this can seem like an unlikely choice   but I promise you you will not be disappointed  And don t be intimidated by the line which is always wrapping out the door and up the   th St  bridge  It is worth the wait if for nothing other than the steak burger    I ve also had the gaucho salad topped with the shredded chicken and it is outstanding  And let s  talk about those sauces    Just get as many little cups and fill them up with every single one  I never remember what s what  but truthfully it doesn t matter      This is one of those places where the food really does live up to the expectations set by all of the press reviews  It s just that good ,5,2016-02-25
Really everything I ve tried here so far has been amazing   Definitely try the grilled chicken along with ajo   Another recommendation is the mixed grilled platter  It gives you a chance to sample the chicken  steak and the chorizo  The next time you visit you can  home  in on your meat of choice ,4,2015-08-09
Believe the hype   Not much to add from other reviewers   Plan to wait in line   It moves fast but there  is always a line   Bring a bottle of wine  no corkage fee   Get the mushrooms side dish   I d try to recommend other items but everything I ve had is equally delicious   It s also extremely reasonable pricing   Go and enjoy ,5,2017-08-05
The food is amazing  You will probably have to wait in a long line though and maybe not get a table because it is extremely popular  In regards to the private room  we held our rehearsal dinner for probably    people in May      and I can t say enough how wonderful it was  Almost everyone said it was the best food they ve ever had including people who live in LA as well as my mid western family who aren t keen on trying different types of food  The service was above and beyond what you could ever expect  The staff was professional but fun  They took pictures of the group and joked around with them all night while also being quick and professional  I really can t praise them enough ,5,2016-10-31
When our production crew and I were in town for work  we were told in reverential tones about this place   and wow  Glad we decided to brave the line  I ve not found a great deal of Argentinian steak places in the US that aren t out west  but this one was a gem    First thing to know  it s not really a sit down  inside  place  They have a couple of counters with a few seats  and then a nice little patio around the building s corner  but otherwise it looks like a carry out place  We weren t aware of this  but found patio spots regardless   As you d expect from a place specializing in Argentinian beef  the thing to order is steak  Or as it s written on the chalkboard  CARNE     I had the ribeye sandwich with onions and tomatoes along with   different types of very subtly different chimichurri sauces  In a word  outstanding  Most of the guys had various types and cuts of beef and all were just perfectly seasoned and the flavor hits you immediately  Can t decide what kind of chimichurri to try  No worries  there is a large table in front of the register that has several large jars of all the different made from scratch options they offer  Take as many as you like to try  They also have a good selection of side dishes to share  try the grilled potatoes   One last element can t go unmentioned  If you re thinking this place looks good but you have a vegetarian with you  no problem  We tried to order the meat based empanadas  Can t remember what kind of meat  but for some reason they were out of the cut they usually do them with  So   with very skeptical attitudes  we opted for the vegetarian empanadas   and they were AMAZING  Just the right mixture of ingredients  perfect texture  served piping hot  They FAR exceeded all expectations for a pack of carnivores like us  Pittsburgh  you ve got a real winner here ,5,2014-09-11
I went to Gaucho s with a friend at around     pm so we didn t have to wait long to get seated  We ordered a large NY strip steak to share  as well as a side dish of mushrooms  The mushrooms were really good and aromatic  However  the steak that we had requested to be cooked medium came out to be too well done  When we told our waitress about it  she agreed with us that it was too well done and went to get her manager  The manager then came  apologized and offered to remake our steak  They were both extremely polite and friendly and handled the situation very well  The steak we ended up getting was perfectly juicy and tender ,5,2017-05-19
This place is amazing  I really was contemplating walking out of the    minute line  but boy am I glad I sucked it up and waited  I ve since come back  x  So yes  you ll probably have to wait in line  and as a heads up you need to order all your food at once and pay for it right there  So plan in our    min wait on everything that you want to eat    One of the great things about Gaucho is that they are a BYOB  I ve failed at remembering this both times  but hopefully someone reading this will benefit from this  Bring your wine or beer  they do not serve alcohol   Hmm recommendations on what to get   beef empanadas  shrimp  steak   and as I m writing this I m realizing I don t think you can go wrong with anything you order   But the shrimp is some of the best I ve had  and we got the party group order of steak  Can t remember what it is called but comes with all the cuts of meats they serve   it was phenomenal and great for sharing with a group    They have the best salsas and sauces so don t forget to get some of these  chimichurri  garlic  and   others that I can t remember off the top of my head  All were very tasty and went well with the meats   You can also order take out  but beware when you walk in to pick up your food and people are standing in line waiting they will give you the evil eye as you walk out with their food while their bellies are rumbling  of course I didn t do that    ,5,2017-11-02
Stopped in to Gaucho while walking around the strip  You cannot resist the wood fired smell as you pass by  The service is friendly at this small amazing Argentinian cafe  Wood  fired grilled steaks  chorizo and seafood  sandwiches   small bites and entrees  Help yourself to   unique sauces and a lot of great food  Don t miss Gaucho,5,2014-04-05
I ve had basically everything on the menu here  I suggest getting a sandwich  it is truly one of the greatest I have ever had  The veggies are a must too  This place just blows it out of the water every time  Affordable and amazing  One of the best places to eat in the city  hands down ,5,2014-08-12
So what good is another   star review  But I must review it  I m obsessed with this place  I tried it for the first time a few weeks ago  and I took crazy pictures and sent it to all my friends  I told them they had to visit just for the sandwich alone   The steak sandwich is truly their best thing  It s grilled and seasoned perfectly  Although they have a sauce station  it really isn t necessary  The broiche bun is also chewy  and it doesn t get soggy  The papas  potatoes  are done well  and the grilled corn  a must as well   I loved  loved it  I ve had similar offerings in other major cities  and this is one of best sandwiches I ve tried  Who knew that Pittsburgh had the best Argentinian steak sandwich   Oh yeah  BYOB with no corking fee  Score ,5,2014-08-25
This is a cute little restaurant in the strip district   I was greeted by the ambassador with the name Don  He was very nice and explained to me all the dishes including his recommendations  I had the new York strip and it was cooked to my request   The restaurant was small so the max capacity was around    ppl the most   Overall the food was good and the kitchen staffs were very friendly   This place is very small so don t be shock if you have to stand by the sauce and condiments table in the middle of the restaurant   This is so great about these little neighborhood restaurants b c you feel like you re at home   I m not sure about others  but I m not here for the   stars ambience   It s all about the food taste for me   I ate at places where I have to sit on the curb  and the police chased after the food vendor for non established restaurant   If I have to sit on the sidewalk for Gaucho then SIDEWALK IT IS ,5,2015-01-19
Absolutely great place for lunch or weekend shopping  It s a little cramped inside  but worth it  Everything on the menu that I ve had has been delicious so you really can t go wrong  Definitely try all the sauces they have set out  Worth the price ,5,2014-01-24
I recommend ordering the salad  either regular size or share the large size  plus ask add on the steak or braised beef  You can also buy  toast  it s like a large crispy crostini  Good quality meat  Casual  cool place to eat  Metered street parking was easy to find during the weekday ,4,2017-09-03
Super friendly and upbeat staff that make you smile from start to finish and absolutely delicious food make this place worth the wait  the line was out the door    The trendy and young crowd made me worry that we might have picked the wrong place to take our    year old at first   However  we ordered the Bife de Gaucho  Pollo Parrillada  Pork and Chicken Empanadas  Arroz  Maiz  and Vegetales   My child  who is a super picky eater  ate some of everything and agreed that it was all delicious   I wish they had this place in Chicago ,5,2016-07-16
Great food and service  I d avoid peak hours  The wait can be long but it s totally worth it ,5,2017-11-07
I came here because a coworker told me to check it out and he was right  This place is the best lunch spot  The steak sammiches are amazing  Highly recommend ,5,2016-01-27
I heard great things about this place and that it was a  must  when visiting Pittsburgh  After waiting nearly an hour in line  we finally ordered from their giant menu of items   Its an order first  then sit down and we bring the food to you place   The only thing I can appreciate  but would rather have them do differently is the presentation of the menu  It s on a giant blackboard when you walk in and they use odd words for simple ingredients  so you re standing there just trying to figure out what s in the food  for example  shrooms   mushrooms  grass   asparagus     Aside from the menu  the service was nice up front  great manager  he will always find a seat for you and your party   however the servers that wait the tables are very unprofessional  All the staff where whatever they want and it s not very helpful when you need to flag someone down  There was a woman with half her stomach hanging out in very short shorts   not pleasant    On to the food   the salad I ordered was amazing   very tasty  The empanadas were bland and too pricey     ea   I still agree that if you re in the area  you must come try the food ,4,2017-06-08
I finally made it here a few weeks ago for lunch  I ve had their amazing food truck offerings before but had not been to their restaurant   Lunch on a weekday is busy but the woman taking our drink order treated us like we were her only customer  She gave some great suggestions for ordering  It was a toss up for me between steak and salad  She recommended the salad with steak  What a novel idea    Why didn t I think of that   So  I got the Argentio with medium rare steak  It was so good   The steak was cooked just right and there where so many good flavors mixed together in the Argentio salad  I would go back again just for that  But they have some many other amazing sounding items on their menu  I can t wait to go back ,4,2018-07-27
Food is good  maybe somewhat overpriced but quality meats and delicious tasting food  I wish they had a bigger space  parking and a liquor license to serve  but some people may prefer the BYOB aspect of it ,4,2018-04-07
One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh   Just wonderful   everyone I take there thanks me with amusement   Food is delicious  fresh  well prepared  staff is nice and cordial   I just wish they took reservations because the line is quite long at times  but don t be discouraged   It is worth the wait  ,5,2017-06-12
You can t go wrong with any meal here  Definitely one of the best restaurants In the city  Be warned   it s casual and you order in line when you walk in so not a fancy ambiance at all  but a must try for any  meat lover  The carne sandwiches are my go to and the spicy chorizo is untouchable  Beef empanadas are really good as well ,5,2017-11-21
I really would have liked to give these guys   or   starts but in spite of great appetizers  reasonable prices  and friendly service  the flank steak entree I had was pretty lacking  It just tasted charred  I intend to go back and try a different dish because I have a really good feeling about this place and I think they may have just messed up my order  But I was not impressed with the first steak I had ,3,2015-08-09
Food poisoning  I get it  this place is very popular  Lines out the door  People raving about it  Staff emboldened  Lots of buzz  But  when things don t go quite as planned that is the true test of an establishment  I ve been coming here weekly for some time  Two weeks ago I decided to try the  steak burger  cooked medium  which I have never eaten there before  I got it to go  got home  was very hungry  but midway through eating it  though it was flavorful  I felt a rumbling in the stomach and physically could not finish it     minutes later I was in the bathroom with a problem  My GI tract was thrown off for a week  I called Gaucho and asked to speak to management  Spoke to manager Mike  told him the problem  told him to please check the burger batch and not feed that to any more customers as it was clearly contaminated  He assured me he would speak to chef and offered to get me a free meal to make up for it  I didn t expect that  but then he took my number and said he would call within the next few days to follow up  No call came  It s been   weeks  Don t make empty promises  especially when your customer was sickened by your food  This has left me very bitter to Gaucho  Enjoy the yummy tasting food but don t expect this place to do anything for you if you have a problem  And watch out for the burger ,1,2016-03-19
Luckily walked to Primanti Bros  after a Pirates game and on the way there  my nose picked up the magical aroma of wood smoke  Popped my head in and found they opened at    for the next days lunch   You can smell the smoke from outside and once you walk in it s amplified  The inside is small with my a dozen seats  The menu is written on a chalkboard on the wall  full of tough choices  We decided on the rosemary braised beef sandwich   corn and sweet potatoes  The sandwich was enormous and amazing  The corn and sweet potatoes were cooked over an open fire and also delicious    I will definitely return next visit ,5,2014-07-23
It s not Argentina but this place is close enough  It s a fast casual place so you order when you walk in and they call you by name when your order is up  Unfortunately they don t have a liquor license  which we didn t know until we got there  but it s BYOB with no corkage fee  All the utensils plates are also self serve and located right after the order counter  Reynaldo have   sauces available  classic chimichurri  garlic  smokey pepper and onion   We ordered the carne and rosemary beef sandwiches  beef empanada  red potatoes and of course the alfajores  The beef empanada was ok and could go without it   Everything else were amazing though  Both sandwiches were great but I especially loved the carne  You get a choice of the cut of beef and how you want it cooked  just like any great steak place    The sandwich had a great amount of nicely charred and perfectly cooked meat in it  The flavor is already great but I love garlic so I had to add some of their garlic sauce  Another amazing garlic surprise are the grilled garlic gloves that came with the potatoes  You can t go wrong with finishing up your amazing meal with some alfajores  They are very delicate though so they don t travel well   Definitely a great place for meat  carb and garlic lovers ,5,2017-06-24
It s all been said already but I ll say it again just to add to the   star reviews  Yummy     We had the Rosemary braised beef sandwich and the chorizo sandwich  Bread was so stellar and crispy and chorizo so nice and spicy  I added some red sauce to the braised beef sandwich and it took it up even another notch  The corn was good and juicy and the grilled vegetables with balsamic were flavor packed as well    Next time I m in town I will try the steak platters  they looked amazing    Also the back patio had many seats even during a very busy time of day and the staff came out to check on how we were doing and asked how the food is  Nice people working there  This place is not to be missed ,5,2015-07-05
Gaucho Parilla  Considering this is a hotspot  this place is great  However  the meat is a bit on the rarer side on the inside and charred on the outside  However  the sauces they have  chimichurri  ajo  etc   are amazing  You must flavor your meat like this  It is a very hip experience  and is an awesome place to eat lunch  However  make sure to be prepared for a line and or come early  The menu is also kind of narrow  In conclusion  I give this restaurant four stars because it is a great atmosphere  but the meat isn t as amazing as authentic Argentinian meat  which I have tried before  This might be because it is the US and it would be too hard to import  duh   But  yeah  I definitely recommend this place   ,4,2016-06-17
They re not exactly a well oiled machine in getting food out  clearing tables  or seating people  and the one main seating room is just   flat walls that reverberate sound really loudly it s difficult to have a conversation  However  the food was great  The caramelized veggie plate  papas and the mixed meat plate all had really great flavors and portions were perfect for two very hungry out of towners  Would recommend if you have the time to wait,4,2015-10-03
If you like meat  this is the place  Everything we had was delicious and full of flavor  Best to call in an order than wait in the line  Oh  and BYOB  Enjoy ,5,2015-07-12
They were closing today so we had to get a taste before we went back home  Every time we tried to get in the line was huge  Now I know why  It s such an amazing experience  Delicious flank steak sandwich  Grilled vegetables and grilled corn  Will be back  They are closing for   weeks ,5,2015-04-04
Absolutely delicious  We ate here for a rehearsal dinner and it was easily one of the best meals I have ever had in the city   Service was fantastic  and the meat and potatoes were amazing    Will definitely come back again ,5,2015-09-12
Delicious   Everything we ordered was great  Sirloin steak plate  potatoes  rice   and Caramelized onions  Yum    The menu was a little confusing and overwhelming  but the staff was very helpful and friendly ,5,2015-08-08
Believe the hype   I ordered the carne sandwich with filet mignon steak and was astounded  The steak was cooked to a juicy medium rare  The peppers were charcoaled perfectly  The caramelized onions were sweet and savory  The chimichurri added a nice bitter taste  And the bread absorbed all the juices and allowed all of the different flavors to stand out in unison   This was one of the best sandwiches I ve ever had  It s undoubtedly the best sandwich I ve had in Pittsburgh  I m not even sure we should refer to it as a sandwich considering how transcendental it is ,5,2014-03-22
Guacho has one of the best steak sandwiches in Pittsburgh  They serve authentic Argentinian cuisine in a hip  casual setting  This particular time I ordered the Argentino salad with ribeye  and a side of provoletta  All of our food came out in a timely matter and everything was delicious  especially the ribeye  Their friendly staff  cool setting   delicious menu make this restaurant one of the best in the Strip  I can t wait to come back and try more of their incredible food options  although it will be hard to switch up my order when the steak is so good ,5,2017-11-19
Great lunch  First time to PITT and was told to check this place out by a buddy  Wasn t disappointed at all  Not overly busy at lunch and took my time to read the menu  Everything I ordered was delicious and would recommend  Super clean and very friendly staff  You do order first and then sit so keep that in mind  They bring your food out and they have pseudo waiters that clean up your plates which is nice  Tipping apparently is at the beginning as well  Little different but whatever    everyone seems to be putting a little different spin on how things work these days  I got up and refilled my water as I needed and if your boozing it s BYOB  otherwise they have some pop and some other non etoh options ,5,2017-12-05
Amazing  It taste like I m on vacation  My   year old son absolutely loved the ribeye plate and the saffron rice was perfect  He empanada crust was favorful   I will certainly return ,5,2015-06-11
Happened to be in the strip and noticed there was NO line which is very unusual  Had skirt steak sandwich and officially fell in love with Gaucho Parrilla  AMAZING,5,2017-12-04
We were only in Pittsburgh off one night and wanted to find something different to try   Based on the excellent rating and reviews  we tried this out  We were NOT disappointed  The food we excellent  The staff was very friendly and made a point to converse with us throughout the meal  but definitely not in an annoying way   Also the atmosphere was casual and fun and very communal in nature  This would be a great place to take a group and share several entrees with the table ,4,2017-09-15
One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh  Always worth the wait  Ask for the bread not to be too toasted and the carne is always good  If they have muscles  order them  the best I have ever had in the US  The potatoes always good as sides ,5,2017-12-05
It was good as always  We had rosemary braised beef  steak burgh and maiz  love all   kind of sauce  the rosemary beef has been a all time favorite so far and we tried the steak sampler as well as some other sandwiches and burgh that i forgot about the name of  but everything we have tried here were great so i don t think anybody can ever go wrong with any pick ,5,2016-08-09
I can see why this place has so many reviews  The steak was just meaty perfection especially dipped in the abundant garlic and chimichurri sauces  The empanada was okay  We tried the chicken chorizo  I loved the cauliflower side dish too  We got the hanger steak and the sirloin steak and it came with salad and charred bread and the heavenly sauces ,5,2018-05-09
Food is amazing but since it s always crowded  they rush you out  They were so rude to my friends and I one day when we were catching up after dinner  They asked us to leave since there were people coming in  I understand you re busy but they were very rude about it ,3,2017-03-31
BYOB  Had a NY strip plate  Very flavorfully marinated meat  nicely charred  very tender likely topped with herb sauce  There are upstairs tables and few tables downstairs and counter seating  The line builds up fast during rush hours  expect a wait ,4,2018-08-07
Lines out the door  but the food is amazing  If they are busy  They will kick you out as soon as your done eating to get your table  so be prepared for that  BYOB  No corkage fees  Would  return ,4,2017-07-29
Visited on a weekday when it was less crowded  ordered    empanadas for      for our family of     Food came out immediately  probably due to what we ordered   Others with more complex meals waited longer than us for their food   Many yummy sauces available to dip  adding to the adventure for our family   Drove by on a Saturday     pm and a line was out the door   be ware   Filled to the brim with hipsters eating hip food   Not a problem  but we are square    something suburbanites   Joke   How do you get rid of a hipster   Throw him in the main stream  ,4,2017-07-09
The food was amazing   I m here for a conference and stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant  It s a must try  You do have to wait in line and then they seat you  There was a young lady that came out and went through the line to answer questions   It made the time fast and honestly I didn t mind after the amazing food was presented   I had the beet salad with shrimp  empanada and roasted cauliflower  It was all amazing  The food is prepped per order   My co worker had a steak that he said was awesome   It s a must try  Be patent it s worth the wait ,5,2017-11-03
The food is too oily for my taste and i am not partial to the flavors  Atmosphere is nice  Just not for me ,3,2018-04-28
Time to add the umpteenth   star review for the Gaucho   The place was bumping even at an off time  mid afternoon on a Saturday  but fortunately we grabbed one of the few seats in the rustic eating area   Enjoyed a three meat combo plate with delicious steak  grilled chicken and sausage   The best part was the grilled bread   toasty and salty with olive oil drizzled on top   Definitely seek this place out in the Strip District   es muy bueno ,5,2013-11-16
I tried Gaucho about a week ago and it was a very interesting and satisfying experience  I went on a Thursday evening and was able to enjoy a table with   other friends comfortably in a relaxed and inviting atmosphere  This being my first experience it is one that I recommend to anyone looking for something different in the city  I had the red snapper filet and it was delicious  The four sauce choices made a big difference and he roasted potatoes complimented the snapper seamlessly  Check out Gaucho Parrilla Argentina ,4,2018-03-16
I have been to Gaucho s a few times now and it has been a consistently great experience each time  Great place to take people visiting out of town  right in the Strip District  very close to downtown  They don t take reservations and demand is high  so there are often lines and wait of upwards of    minutes on the weekends especially   So  is the wait worth it  I d say yes  although definitely recommend going on a weekday if you can  Their steak is flavorful and reasonably priced and served with bread and a salad  They have a variety of dipping sauces of which I always take back all four to the table even though I definitely have a favorite  I just always forget which one it is     Their empanadas are amazing  especially the beef ones although the chicken ones are pretty good  too  not a fan of the vegetarian cheese ones I once tried    the options rotate frequently  so there s always a new filling to try    I ve heard the dessert there is good as well  but have not had the chance to try yet   ,4,2018-08-24
Very nice and cozy  place  with delicious food   we got Lamb chops  and whole wing it s was amazing   you can bring your own Bottle lot of interesting people dining here  very crowded so come in advance ,5,2017-02-10
Gaucho s doesn t need my review   but I will give it anyway    LOVE LOVE LOVE IT   WOW   this place is really amazing   The beef is crazy delicious  and the roasted veggies were seriously the best ever   I know there is always a long wait and limited seating   BUT   if you can visit during an off time  like mid afternoon    you can get right in and get a table   We are lucky to have a fantastic creative restaurant like this in Pittsburgh ,5,2017-03-20
Gaucho has left me inspired  So inspired that I feel the need to write poetry   A Haiku to Honor Gaucho  Meat meat meat meat meat  Meat meat meat meat meat meat meat  Meat meat meat meat  Yum     AND   An Ode to Rosemary Braised Beef  Your beef is so juicy   Your onion so sweet  Your bread is so lovely  You re the best thing to eat   Your horseradish is horsey   Every flavor in place  Now stop waxing poetic And get in my face     Everything about Gaucho is perfection  the staff  the atmosphere  the sauces  and the food  There s always a line  of course  but it moves fairly quickly  This place is a well oiled machine  You order and pay at the register  grab your drinks  and give your name  Then you pray to the restaurant gods for an open table  Front of the house staff will help you with this endeavor     Food is served up quickly and it s some of the best food that I ve tasted in the Burgh  Meat is flavorful and cooked perfectly  The potatoes are little nuggets of happiness  Each of the four house sauces are exciting and distinctly delicious  I m in love ,5,2016-03-19
Wow  what unique food at a wonderful value  Does it get any better   Friends urged us to try the Gaucho Parrilla Argentina food at a Yelp  event and it was absolutely mouth watering  The staff was very helpful and nice and served us even though there was    minutes left to go of the event  I tried the Rosemary Braised Beef   Horsey sauce and caramelized onion  and the Chanchito   pork tenderloin  pickled onion  mushroom and arugula   The Rosemary Braised Beef was pretty good  I pretty much love anything with caramelized onion  so I knew I wouldn t be disappointed  but I didn t know that this beef dressed with horse radish was going to be so good  The horse radish flavor was subtle but you definitely tasted it every bite  I m not a usual fan of horse radish  but the hint of it on the beef really made the dish exquisite  I favored the Chanchito dish over the beef though  The pork with the arugula  pickled onion and mushroom was just the perfect amount of flavors that complimented each other in a way that most palettes haven t been accustomed to  It was a unique way to dress up pork and a flavor experience like none other  I am so happy this Yelp  event introduced me to Gaucho s amazing eats  I already have my eye on a couple dishes and I cannot wait to try more food from Gaucho ,5,2014-11-13
There are so many reviews on this place so I will make it short and sweet    Just eat here  eat anything that sounds good  and you won t be sad  You will be full  happy and in love    The staff take their time to help recommend something that you will love and I didn t feel rushed at all to make a choice  I want to work here just so I can eat here everyday ,5,2015-11-11
Absolutely fantastic food  One of the only few restaurants that leaves me speechless during every bite  The workers there are very friendly and are more than happy to explain the large menu and offer you recommendations    On the rare occasion when they re not as busy  you ll receive a more standard waiter style service  Our host seated us at our booth after order  checked up on us from time to time  and refilled our waters  However  expect to fill up your own water and retrieve your own plates and utensils during peak times   My go to s are always the baked empanadas  a pollo sandwich  and the alfajores for dessert  The empanadas are freshly made  amazing  and have a different filling each day  They feature three main fillings   a veggie  beef  and chicken  sometimes pork  option  The fillings are intricately crafted and the flavors mesh incredibly well  Pair these with any of their god tier signature sauces and you ll be swimming through a sea of flavors  Get these for sure    The Pollo sandwich is large yet inexpensive  and full of flavor  just like everything else on the menu  The grilled ciabatta bread is crispy and robust  the perfect bread to almost contain the overflowing scrumptious contents of this hefty sandwich   caramelized onions  mashed rosemary potatoes  grilled mushrooms  and the thick cut of chicken breast  The chicken itself is marinated in their legendary Ajo garlic sauce  my personal favorite   Cut the sandwich in half  scoop on some sauces before each bite  and you ll wish the sandwich never ends    Their steaks and steak sandwiches are out of this world as well  Generally cooked to a medium with an amazing wood fire chear and sear  topped with their chimmi sauce  Hands down the best steak I ve ever had    Lastly  the Alfajores    on their website they have kind of a stale description  flavored shortbread with dulce de leche   toasted coconut  but the Alfajores are so much more than that  The shortbread on these cookies are unlike anything I ve ever had before  The Alfajores are a tiny cookie sandwich rimmed with the toasted coconut  The cookie is unbelievably soft and the dulce de leche is the perfect choice to hold these two soft pillowy shortbread cookies together  Each bite is an otherworldly experience    The sauces are essential with every meal at Gaucho and can be paired with whatever is in front of you  except maybe the Alfajores   I ll try that next time   So  I will attempt to do my best to describe the four    Ajo   My favorite sauce  pairs well with everything on the menu  Has a robust garlicy and rosemary flavor  Scoop this on everything   Chimmi   Fantastic on steaks and the chicken  a bit more watery than the other   heavenly sauces but the herbs and flavors of this one keeps me coming back   Pimenton   Has a slight vinegary tang  but the strong fire roasted pepper comes through in this one  with a hint of freshly ground black peppercorn  Great on any of the empanadas Cebolla   Amazing balance of flavors featuring caramelized onions that have been slow roasted and melded into this amazing concoction  Great on everything as well     I d be more than happy waiting   hours in line to just grab a single empanada from Gaucho  This place deserves nothing less than   stars  and it shows in their quality  preparation  and flavors of their food ,5,2015-09-11
Went for lunch on a Tuesday  line wasn t bad at all  Had the small filet plate  beef and pork empanada and arroz rice  The filet melts in your mouth and tastes amazing with the chimmi  The empanadas were the best I ve ever had  Definitely will be back ,5,2016-05-21
Wasn t extremely hungry  but have wanted to check out their new space  so I stopped in around   on a Tuesday night  Gaucho boasts an expansive menu that will delight just about anyone  Their newly designed space is also huge in comparison to their older location  which means they can now offer ample seating  which wasn t really available before   Given I wasn t in the mood for a large meal  I ordered two of their chicken empanadas  they also come in steak and vegetable   The empanads are modest in size  but were really tasty and not greasy or heavy  They have an assortment of sauces that you can try and add to just about anything you order  I can t remember which I tried  but it was delicious and I d assume they are all made on site   Tip  If heading over to Gaucho on the weekends  be prepared for a potential line out the door  That said  give yourself some extra time if in a rush ,4,2015-07-29
Had a really big meal with friend  Food were tasty and service was good  You have to go there early especially on Saturday since there would be a lot of people and a long waiting line for you ,5,2015-11-21
Absolutely love this place    Even for the non meat eater you have options   Mikey  the manager is always friendly and in a very good mood   The food is fantastic and the portions and price are fair   Make sure you have your entire party together before going since you order in a line and then pick out a table  instead of table service ,5,2016-06-24
if you come to pittsburgh  How could you not try burger in Gaucho    ,5,2015-10-22
Amazing food but prepare to wait in line before you will be able to get your hands on some  The staff is super friendly and helpful  They will answer any questions you have about the menu    As for the food  it is one of the best places in Pittsburgh  All the ingredients are fresh and well prepared for all the dishes they serve  I am a big fan of their  sammiches   sandwiches   They are made on crunchy  grilled bread and whatever else comes with that specific sandwich  Their empanadas are dank   sooo good  They come straight out of the oven and I wish I had one to eat while writing this  They also have four dipping sauces throughout the restaurant which are so good you can eat them with a spoon  Their shortbread cookies are also scrumptious for dessert    All in all  Gaucho is deserving of more than just   stars for its food and service ,5,2016-06-12
OK  with     reviews and a solid   star rating on Yelp  there is no question the food here is outstanding   Not because I am saying so  but because     other people are saying so     So I am going to choose to not speak about the delicious morsels we consumed for lunch nor show you photos of those morsels  but rather to express a bit about Anthony  the owner of Gaucho  who was behind the counter taking our order and running the register when we stopped in today    Go to Gaucho because of Anthony   It is a rarity to meet someone like him in the restaurant business   Because the beauty of a great meal is not only about the food  but it is the  experience  that comes with that food     In addition to really having a winning personality and a top notch customer service touch  Anthony has a passion for his menu  his kitchen  his food and his staff   Although he does not seem like the kind of guy who is ever going to flash his culinary credentials  after prodding it out of him a bit  clearly he has a great pedigree in the business and it is to Pittsburgh s great fortune that he has chosen to share the culmination of this experience and his craft here in the Strip District   He was sincerely welcoming  genuinely interested in sharing his knowledge about the food from his kitchen and exuded respect  fun and flair with us and also with his staff     Go to Gaucho because it is a worthy unique opportunity to taste something special   More importantly though  go to Gaucho because you want to meet Anthony and support this good guy and his great staff who are really doing something special in the food world ,5,2015-01-10
SOOOO GOOD  If you have the opportunity to go here  go    They have a really big menu  so there are plenty of different options    It s a pretty relaxed restaurant environment as well  You get your drinks and you order at the front  and then you sit down wherever  A server will call your name when they have your order and they ll bring it over to your table  Also it s byob  I got the pescado sandwich which was amazing  The bread is grilled a little bit and the sandwich itself is very flavorful  They have additional sauces around the area that you can bring over to your table and make your order even more delicious  The empanadas are also really good  and they are adorably tiny  The flan was delicious  and comes with apples on top  Basically  the food is great ,5,2017-09-22
Gaucho is one of the best restaurants in town  Very down to earth and quick  The line is always long  but well worth the wait  My boyfriend and I had the cheese bread and a small meat platter  The meat was so tender and flavorful  it was so delicious  The employees were helpful and patient as well as informative  We will definitely be back to try more of the menu ,5,2016-09-19
I m soooooo glad Rich C  pointed this gem out to me   Anytime you can smell an intoxicating aroma well before you can even see its source  you know that some serious grubbage is about to go down   Walk in  and you re greeted with an open and welcoming  dining  room     more or less a center island  housing a variety of to die for sauces and additions for the unreal grilled creations offered  and a set of wrap around wall bars  standing only    The staff were very attentive  and best yet  honest   When asking for a recommendation  I was steered towards the skirt steak sandwich  hands down  over the premium priced filet equivalent   Be well aware     this is not a fast casual joint per say   Each order of meat is hand cut and grilled to order   The fiancee and I decided to split a sandwich and order a pair of empanadas  which I had  until this point  failed to find a good representation of in PGH   and in whole  it took about    minutes from the time we ordered to receive our food   After tasting it  it was WELL worth it   The steak well deserves the typical   literally melts in your mouth  tag phrase  and my brother s sausage was equally decadant    Hands down   one of my new favorite stops on our monthly strip adventures ,5,2013-06-06
Great set up  Food is delicious and I am glad this type of cuisine showed up in Pittsburgh  Worth the wait and the money,5,2015-09-30
I ll be brief   this is the best tasting  highest quality steak sandwich I have ever eaten   The guys were EXTREMELY friendly  and even offered us beers right before they closed   I can t wait to fly back to Pittsburgh just to eat here again ,5,2014-12-05
Line was very long and parking was difficult on Saturday  But the food was amazing and totally worth it  Got the flank steak  It was perfectly cooked and the flavor was excellent ,5,2016-09-07
There s always a wait  but it s so worth it  One of my favorite lunch spots in the whole city  Everything is tender and cooked to perfection ,5,2017-08-09
LOVE this place  The steak is excellent  and everything is good and reasonably priced  BYOB is nice too  Don t skip dessert  the bread pudding is phenomenal  The only down side is the wait can get long at certain times  Go a little early or late if you can  but if you do have to wait   it s worth it ,4,2017-04-24
After reading reviews and seeing a line out the door the day before we visited  hubby was a little disappointed  I thought it was great  We tried a few different items from the menu  Everyone is raving about the Rosemary beef  I enjoyed the pork more  Excellent burger  though we did have to send back to cook longer   it was for one of the kids   Spicy chorizo was excellent   and spicy  The sauces are excellent   the chimmi was our favorite ,4,2016-03-31
Great food  They ve been mixing up their counter service table service but it s always fantastic food and it can either be a splurge or an everyday meal ,4,2016-09-12
What an amazing ethnic restaurant and just sorry it took so long to finally stop in  The food menu is extensive and TAAAAAASTY  From the steak to the papas potatoes to the empanadas to the salad  everything was exceptional  The sauces are available to go  BUY SOME  Better than store bought hands down  The service is attentive and super friendly and helpful  You will have a wait to order but it s highly worth it  You will leave happy  ,5,2018-02-03
Came here with a friend based on recommendations of other friends  This place lives up to the hype  I ordered the NY strip steak medium rare  My only complaint was that the steak came out medium  not medium rare  Regardless  it tasted delicious with all the sauces available  The salad and the toasted bread were also good ,4,2016-02-18
Words cannot explain how much I love this place  The food is freaking delicious  and the service outstanding  They serve Argentinian wood fired meats  and man do they do it well  My favorite thing to get is Bife de Gaucho served medium rare  The steak is so juicy  flavorful  and tender  Drooling thinking about it  I have also tried the gaucho papas  empanadas  and carne  All delicious  They serve freshly made chimichurri and sauces that are served as sides  This is a must try restaurant  you won t be disappointed ,5,2015-05-07
Absolutely the best place I ever eaten in Pittsburgh  The place is a little hard to get and finding parking relies on luck  but once you are there  the food is divine   The atmosphere is a classy  hipster type and the different types of food from snack dishes  to salad  sandwiches or real steak and desserts are there to make up for all the hassle you have to go through to get there  My SO had ribeye steak and I had a steak sandwich  I had to say  the steak was really good   moist and juicy and cooked to your desired level  However  what amazed me was the seasoning they put on the sandwich bread that made me go ooh aah while eating it  Most of the time  the sandwich places make their fillings taste good but fail miserably with seasoning the buns condiments that go with it  With Gaucho Parrilla Argentina  however  they get both right   Even my SO still raved about this place and the place stood out in both our minds when we thought about the best meal we had in Pittsburgh as well   Price was really reasonable  especially with the portion and such awesome taste you get  The waiter cashier were super helpful  too  It does also help that the atmosphere is classy super inviting  too  Go  if you are in Pittsburgh   and definitely make a case to stop and eat at this place even if you are just a visitor in town  Next time I m back in Pittsburgh   I will hike my way there again   D,5,2015-09-26
I ve been eyeing this place for a while  by which I mean smelling it    You can smell the smoke rolling off of a place such as this from blocks away  It s the same reason why you never see an ad for Cinnabon  If you get people by the nose  their ass will follow promptly    I was pleased upon entering to see a clean  and well decorated place  I dread walking into a new place  and seeing that perhaps someone can cook  but be clueless as to how to make a guest feel welcome  The sun was bursting through the windows onto saffron colored walls and butcher block counters  A giant rosemary plant sat in the window  Every detail was in place    Prices for sandwiches looked little steep  but what landed in front of me was the size of my  th grade lunchbox  so no worries there  I was still in a daze looking at the sandwich on a giant piece of ciabatta bread  when our host was directing us to choose from sauces on the center table to garnish our lunch  Ajo  Pimenton  Cebolla and Chimi Churri  or to you  Anglo  este es roasted garlic  roasted red pepper  roasted sweet onion  and the tradtional sauce of many South American barbecue styles  What Chimi Churri means depends greatly on where you happen to be standing  Some places use a bit of oregano  others some cilantro  All of them center on fresh parsley  olive oil  a bit of garlic and red wine vinegar  These all sat in tasteful jars with sample cups to portion out  It was hard to not get carried away  to be candid   My sandwich was big enough I chose to cut it in half  and try the pimenton on one half  the ajo on the other  The ajo is thoroughly grilled  so the flavor almost has a savory nuttiness to it  instead of the pungent sulphur blast that we often associate with garlic  The pimenton was even better  grilling having mellowed the sweetness of the red pepper  balanced with a pleasing combo of herbs  oil  and vinegar    Let s get something out of the way here  Pittsburgh  Corn on the cob is not to be boiled  As they do south of the border  and also at Gaucho  the ears are placed directly on the grill  Soaked in water first  and grilled with the husk still on  it arrived in a bit of tinfoil  the husk charred black  Peeled back  and used as a handle  there is no need for the Midwestern American plastic corn cob holders  Throw those ridiculous things in the recycle bin  please  Corn originates from Meso America  Trust me  our neighbors to the south know exactly what they re doing  The husk protects the corn from scorching  and it steams in it s own skin  acquiring that important smoky flavor  The carmelized flavors of the cebolla sauce were a perfect compliment   I am almost afraid to tout this place so highly  in that it may become too busy to get some of the awesome grub they re putting out ,5,2015-04-16
SO GOOD  My boyfriend and I were extremely ambitious and we got a small Casa Salad and an Asado Platter to share between the both of us  The salad was    and really tasty with red curly leaf lettuce  radish  grape tomatoes and shaved carrots  It had a yummy but not heavy salad dressing  which I really enjoyed  The Asado Platter was     and included a small portion of each of the five cuts of meat  Flank  sirloin  filet mignon  NY strip  and ribeye  My favorite was the filet and my boyfriend s favorite was the sirloin  Every cut was super tender  The chimichurri sauce was the best of all the sauces  Also  the Asado Platter is absolutely way too much food for two people  It s a   person portion and comes with toast  Definitely recommend this place  ,5,2016-10-15
As everyone knows by now  this is no longer a well kept secret in the Strip District  Gaucho certainly has a cult following and its worth the wait in line up the street  I would recommend going with a smaller group because the seating is limited and we had to wait about    minutes until a table opened  It s all first come  first serve seating  but the staff was more than accommodating to assist you as you waited  They opened our wine and consistently checked on tables to be aware of the status  If you re looking for a leisurely meal  this isn t the spot  but you re only coming here for the food and it is truly excellent ,5,2016-01-21
Took a bunch of guys here again and it universally got the nod as one of the best steak sandwiches every one had ever eaten     I don t know if I even remembered to breathe while inhaling its deliciousness   KEEP IT UP ,5,2013-08-06
Went to Gaucho for the first time today and it certainly won t be my last  The food was delicious  especially the Rosemary braised beef sandwich  Yum ,5,2015-09-10
The meat is so nicely seasoned  Anything you eat here will satisfy you  I tried almost everything from the menu and I never got disappointed  Only downside is the usual line you have to wait to get your hands so some nicely cooked meat ,5,2017-09-14
Really  Really  Really Good     I had the El Gaucho salad with Chicken   It was awesome   Also had the grilled corn   It was perfect    My friend had the ribeye sandwich  it was amazing   The roasted potatoes were great too    A hidden gem in Pittsburgh ,5,2014-05-14
I miss the old Gaucho   This new Gaucho has adopted the Portland concept of slow ordering to create a massive line so that you appear popular   It is disrespectful to your customers ,1,2017-11-09
Gaucho s is bar far  in my opinion  the best food in Pittsburgh  I don t think you ll find a better steak sandwich on earth ,5,2017-02-21
Food taste awesome and have a great atmosphere  However  I felt  like portion of their food was relatively small for it s price ,4,2017-12-09
Excellent steak sandwiches at a great price  The staff is also very helpful at recommending a dish for you if you re unsure  They ll happily explain anything on the menu  They also offer great sides    The only negative of this place is the line and seating as a result of its popularity  If you can  try to go outside of the lunch hour  They recently expanded  but it still can t contain the horde  My hope is they keep up with their success without ever diminishing the quality   This place is amazing,5,2016-10-31
Fantastic food and atmosphere   Worth the wait and its byob   Absolutely loved it   The steak platter was amazing  And the paella was filled with fresh seafood   Don t get me started on the sauces  Chimicurri and garlic are the best I ve ever had   Will definitely go back and try the sandwich ,5,2016-11-30
Unreal  No other words besides unreal  Being from New York where great restaurants abundant and being spoiled with good food I was skeptical when I came to Pittsburg  In look for a restaurant with real  fresh food was the mission  Luckily I passed this restaurant driving and saw a line of people out the door with almost    people down the road  I made it a goal to try the hype the next day  Menu is very accommodating to any kind of meal you d like  So I decided to order a little of it all    The steak  medium rare rib eye COOKED TO PERFECTION  And the flavors  Incredible  The el Gaucho salad  so fresh tossed with a balsamic vinegar   The chiqui chicken small plate  chicken cooked so tender  The spicy chorizo  if you enjoy heat  this is most definitely the dish for you   The layout is great  open kitchen  multiple sauce stations for my saucy people and best of all BYOB    WITH NO CORKING FEE  Hello  This place is amazing    Point blank ,5,2018-06-29
Amazing  just amazing and very tasty  Had this been in nyc or sf they could easily get    x the current pricing  I d say that this is the one of the best steak restaurants i ve had in nyc  pit and sf combined  The vibe is cool hip casual  easily could be the best place in the strip for a date or if you want to pamper yourself with great food ,5,2015-12-29
Man  How did I forget to review this one  This was actually probably our favorite during our short stint in Pittsburgh  I heard they were expanding  but when we were there it was pretty much a small and tight space  which felt even smaller considering its rabid fans   And you ll see why if you sample their meats  And their sauces    and just about anything they serve here  My recommendation is to get the meat platter with most of the meats    Perfect ,5,2017-07-13
Honestly  this has got to be the best restaurant in pittsburgh  The meat is flavorful and just perfect  The sauces are incredible and make you lick your fingers  The bread is divine  My only problem is the lack of seating  reservations  or some smooth run system  You may wait    minutes  or more  in line just to order and wait even longer to get a table  Take out is not always a possibility    Gaucho  expand   This place will become a Pgh staple pretty soon ,5,2016-05-01
After wanting to go here for a number of years I finally drove past and didn t see a huge line outside  Anything and everything on the menu here is great  This is one of the best places in all of Pittsburgh ,5,2018-01-28
The line was unreal but so was the food  I am giving them the benefit of the doubt on the line considering it was the Strip Music Festival  If it wasn t for that  I d definitely give this a   star ,4,2016-01-19
Wow  what can I add that so many of these other reviews haven t already said  Not much  My sons and I each ordered carne sandwiches  They had the flank steak and the filet mignon while I had the NY Strip  They loved theirs  As for me  that might just well have been the best sandwich of any type I ve ever had  Just absolute perfection  The bread  perfect in this role   crunch in the crust but soft on the inside and able to soak up all the juices and not fall apart   the roasted  marinated peppers and onions  the fresh chimichurri  and the absolutely incredible meat  So flavorful  so juicy  so full of wood smoke  Perfection  And no need for a knife  Just melts in your mouth  I live in DC and cannot wait to come back  This place does Pittsburgh proud ,5,2013-08-08
I ve only been once  but this is one of the best meals I ve had  Luckily the long lines move quickly so don t be deterred  The staff manages to keep cool   friendly despite the ravenous customers  Everything I tried was spot on  seasoned well   cooked perfectly  I was surprised to find such an authentic meal in Pittsburgh  I actually considered a weekend getaway just to try again ,5,2016-02-26
Another Pittsburgh institution I had to wait in a long line to enter but  oh man  this time it was DEFINITELY worth it    First off  BYOB  Don t wait until you get here to try and find liquor  as there s no shops in the immediate vicinity  We resorted to East End Brewery for some beers which is around the corner  If you want wine  come prepared    I was with a group of five  so we decided to split the asado plate  FIVE cuts of steak on one plate with toast and chimichurri  On the side  we ordered a house salad  eat your greens    smashed sweet potatoes  roasted potatoes  and empanadas  We chose to sit outside and they happily gave us an ice bucket for our beers which was a great touch  After a little bit of a wait  our food starting rolling in      HOLY MEAT  Be sure to ask for the sauces so you can try them all  but really  the steak can stand alone  I honestly don t know which cut I was eating when  but each was as delicious as the last  The smashed sweet potatoes with vanilla and caraway and sunflower seeds was probably my favorite side  but the salad was actually a refreshing addition  I wish we got more toast to soak up the juices of the steak  but it s probably for the best we didn t  All that food was certainly enough for the five of to roll out full and happy    Wait in line  Order all the meat  Eat all the meat  Dream about the day you can return ,5,2016-10-04
I just found my new favorite steak place in Pittsburgh  Wood fired  smokey meat at an unreal price not to mention a great BYOB policy   Needless to say it took a good    minutes to be seated on an early Saturday afternoon  but the wait is very much worth it     I went here with my wife and friends from Buffalo   The setup of ordering is different than most restaurants as we ordered before being seated   I ended up getting the steak sandwich  Carne  which was your choice of meat served on a ciabatta bun with optional toppings   The couple we went with split the steak platter which included a variety of meat to select for a total of    oz   We brought a    pack to split between us over dinner so we drank that while waiting for our food   When the food finally came  all of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals and were absolutely stuffed afterwards   The meat had an amazing smokey flavor  and in addition to the meat there were   amazing sauces to pair with your food   I would highly recommend trying all       The steak here is extremely impressive  It s hard to beat the smokey flavor and the complimentary sauces   BYOB is a nice option to have with your meal   My only disappointment from the meal was not trying any sides or desserts  I even ordered a sandwich to go to eat later   I will definitely be back here with friends to introduce them to such a great dining experience ,5,2017-05-02
Fantastic  I was looking for a healthy meal and the pescado plate  sword fish  hit the mark  Both the salad and fish were absolutely scrumptious ,5,2016-12-01
Excellent  My favorite spot in the burgh  The sauces and flavors are unique and the meat is quality  The smoky flavor from the wood fire grill compliments every item on the menu  Every time I am a this place I leave satisfied  It s one of those places you need to visit so many times to try everything ,5,2015-12-11
After a   hour and    minute wait on a Saturday night  I was awarded with the finest Argentinian steak I have ever experienced in North America  If it s a perfectly cooked rare steak that you seek  I highly recommend this amazing steakhouse  WELL worth the wait   ,5,2017-10-15
This is one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh  if not thee favorite   I always go with a carne con pan  filet mIgnon medium rare  and I add goat cheese    Cooked perfect every time  it might be the best sandwich I ve ever had ,5,2016-12-06
Wouldn t have known about it if it wasn t for Yelp  Believe the hype  This place kicks serious butt  I d drive hours out of my way to eat here again  The skirt steak is to die for the homemade sauces are ridiculous ,5,2014-08-03
Amazing   We were visiting Pittsburgh for a weekend and were Yelping places to eat  My boyfriend couldn t wait to try Gaucho because he s a major carnivore   The line was out the door when we got here on a Friday night for dinner  The spot looks small at first  but there is seating all the way to the back of the restaurant as you walk in more   The menu is written on one entire wall that you can view when you walk into the restaurant    The process of ordering is pretty simple   You pick what you want  order it  pay  and then someone will bring it to your table when it s ready   There are little stations with their delicious chimichurri sauces  regular  garlic  onion  and red pepper  Loved all of them  but red pepper was probably at the bottom of my list   We couldn t get enough of the chimichurri   I had a small flank steak   oz  and my boyfriend had the small NY Strip   We also got a side of roasted potatoes along with some beef   chicken empanadas   The meat plates came with the best bread and a small side salad  Everything was absolutely delicious   We are still dreaming about Gaucho today  Can t wait to come back so we can eat here again  Wish they sold their sauces in bottles ,5,2015-10-15
I like Gaucho sandwiches as much as the next person  but I can t give it   stars because I haven t found a holy grail item that I d like to order again and again   This place takes really good care of making your sandwich  whether it be the smoked meat  variety of sauces to try  or fresh bread    The interior is coolly decorated and it s definitely a chill place to hang out  I ve gotten the rosemary sandwich  which was decent  Up for trying the burger out next ,4,2017-02-15
Super delicious  I ve had the arrachera meal a couple times and the meat is perfectly cooked  The brussels sprouts are also amazing ,5,2016-01-21
This place is fantastic  I was lucky enough to come when the line was short  and even then it reached the door  I ordered the Parrillada Mixta which was a huge portion  You get a spicy or sweet sausage  grilled chicken  steak  and some crispy bread  All of the meat is extremely flavorful and juicy  The steak came out amazing tender and still had lots of juice  They give you salsas on the side that makes it taste even better  Everything is wood grilled so it has a smoky taste  too  I also ordered empanadas on the side  and total this meal was good enough for me for the day  I would love to come back  and my first time trying Argentinian food was very positive ,5,2017-06-20
Love love love love     My husband and I ate inside here on the hottest  nastiest day of the year so far   We were quite literally sweating our you know whats off  but despite that  Gaucho is an awesome experience   Everything here is wood fired and super delicious   My husband ordered a steak sandwich and they offered him like eight different cuts of steak to choose from   I m kind of a veg head myself and was delighted to find woodfired asparagus and caramelized onions on my salad  YUM   All their condiments are delicious as well  if you love them as much as I did  you can take home a jar for         We will come back again and again and again  it s BYOB as well  which we didn t know  plus we were there for lunch   and I know we ll be spending plenty of fall nights on the cute little patio enjoying delicious food and a bottle of malbec   Seriously  so awesome    It s kind of off the beaten strip district path  but SO worth a try  ,5,2013-07-17
It s worth the wait  The sauces are all tasty  Excellent sandwiches  large enough for left overs ,5,2018-02-25
Be prepared to wait in a long line that wraps around outside the business  But it is well worth the wait  We came about  pm and only had to wait    minutes to order which I hear is towards the shorter end  The staff are all super friendly and helpful so be sure to tip because they all share tips and they definitely deserve it  We got empanadas  a carne sammich with skirt steak  and a small skirt steak plate  THE BEST PART IS THEY HAVE   SAUCES THAT ARE ALL AMAZING AND YOU CAN HAVE AS MUCH AS YOU DESIRE   We also got our food fast and it was so delicious  My mouth is still full of flavor  Definitely recommend but don t go at peak lunch or dinner time if you don t want to wait a long time ,5,2017-03-18
Best decision I ve made in recent memory  I had passed by Gaucho numerous times while in the strip and I made a mental note to try it  I was somewhat concerned it was going  to be like the Brazilian and argentine steak houses with massive amounts of meat and prices to match  Oh but how wrong I was  I came in on a Tuesday evening after deciding eating at  pm reservation was way too late for my five year old  I was overwhelmed by all the meat options and somehow ended up getting a gaucho salad   don t judge I love meat  after asking the charismatic chef for recommendations   My salad had fancy lettuce  avocado  roasted corn carmelized onions and other stuff   Somehow I missed that it didn t have meat   Boooo my reading skills suck  My guy ordered the rosemary steak sandwich and I tried his   My salad was good but I coveted that steak sandwich like it was salvation or an invisibility cloak  It was so tender and flavorful with great bread  This is definitely a place I ll take friends family when I wanna show them the best Pgh has to offer ,5,2014-04-11
This place is ridiculously good  Authentic  delicious wood fired treats  Everything Gaucho s serves is incredible  I make it a point to go there any time I m within a reasonable distance of Pittsburgh  If you give Gaucho s anything less than a five star rating  I m going to assume you re either a competitor  or some dummy who doesn t understand that you sometimes have to wait in line for things ,5,2017-03-29
Came during the week for a late lunch  around  pm   and the long was only a few people with lots of table seating  You order when you get in and then there s a host who will find a table for you    I wasn t that hungry so got the Provoletta  Like an open faced grilled cheese the provolone was melted over a slice of wood oven toast  Perfect vehicle for the sauces they provide  Nom nom  The provolone came with a small side salad   The other dishes are sized for one hungry person or two light lunches  Sadly I didn t get to try anyone elses dishes are they were all gobbled up ,4,2017-07-13
Outdoor seating   BYOB   I had high expectations of this place with all the rave reviews and   stars   I was NOT disappointed   I have a feeling that the  word  is getting out fast about this place   Their menu was full of delicious sounding creations it was hard for us to decide   We asked if they could just put us together some mixed grilled vegetables and meats   That they did   We enjoyed a platter of mixed meats with shrimp  a large salad  toasted bread  grilled vegetables and delicious sauces   Everything was so flavorful and cooked perfectly and their home made sauces went well with everything   The staff was super friendly and accommodating   It was nice enough to sit outdoors and we enjoyed the atmosphere and the food   It is a small place  some may describe as a  hole in the wall   but I disagree  it is small but  charming   Their food is unique and tasty  tasty  tasty and BYOB  well that is just fantastic   We will be back to try some of their other items   YUM    ,5,2014-04-22
I concur with most of the reviews that rave about the quality of the food  However  the overall dining experience in both of the   times I ve eaten here would have to be ranked somewhere between unsatisfactory and downright unpleasant     The wait time for actually ordering food is so out far out of control as to defy belief  If there is a line of any length outside the door  be prepared for at least a    minute wait to reach your turn to order  As someone who designs and re engineers processes  it was a particularly painful experience to observe such a complete lack of competence in this restaurant s food ordering procedure  Unless the intention is to actually limit revenue  management would be well served by hiring a consultant to streamline the process  there is so much hanging fruit  or at least visit and learn from restaurants that use line flow best practices ,3,2017-01-21
Kay  her friend  and I were to come here on President s Day  but damn it if they re not open on Mondays  A concert the following night at Altar Bar eventually brought me to this diminutive  re purposed house of finished wood as I was determined to explore the world of Argentine cuisine for the first time    And like other ethnic cuisines I ve had tastes of  it all seemed so familiar yet so peregrine    As I took in the interiors  I felt as if I was in for a blasphemous celebration of meat  Benches and tables resembled butcher s blocks  Flames as orange as the noonday sun shot up from a metallic grill that was fueled by smoldering logs fit for evenings of campfires and eerie storytelling    I was greeted by a white haired man in a black turtleneck who resembled Anderson Cooper  I ll shall dub him Prince Carne  He introduced himself and gave me a tutorial of sorts as he showed me their chalkboard menu  Having always wanted to sample some empanadas  I settled on those as a snack  Feeling indecisive  I allowed Prince Carne to sell me on the Matambre sandwich and awaited my meal as I read reviews of independent films  gotta take in  Searching For Sugarman  now  on a news sheet    I can t figure out what the empanadas reminded me of most  pierogi  dumplings  sambusa  Hot Pockets  or wontons  Nevertheless  these charred parcels of pastry were magnanimously stuffed with beef  onion  egg  and olives of Spanish origin  I found choosing condiments difficult  so I slathered both the empanadas and sandwich with ajo  extra virgin olive oil infused with garlic and herbs  and Chimmichurri  extra virgin olive oil imbibed with parsely  oregano  garlic  vinegar  and something called  salmuera      And I found I didn t really need either  as tasty as each oil was    Particularly shaking off any condiment was the ragingly demonic bull that was the Matambre sandwich  Armored with a sturdy hide of Ciabatta bread  a scarlet tongue of red pepper elongated from the beast s carnivorous mouth  Grilled onions  caramelized into sweet obedience  were invisible to my eyes but not my teeth and taste nodes  The beef was rare and pink and luscious and dripping in its natural juices  this South American steak hoagie simultaneously expanding my culinary sphere of experience and teaching me that we re all eating the same things  albeit in differing permutations    Of course  I still don t give a fark about what s authentic and what isn t  As long as it s good  it wins  and GPA passes this academic quarter with a        As I finished my meal  I spoke with bespectacled owner Tony Falcon and another employee whom I recognized as an alumnus of Lawrenceville s popular Italian eatery Piccolo Forno  he served me a sandwich to go on my break over a year ago   bragging about the exciting evening with thrash metal legends I had on deck    I looked directly across Penn Avenue towards Altar Bar only to see that not a single metallion was waiting outside  A sinking feeling that the show had been cancelled held my stomach hostage  Quickly  I called Kay and had her check online to see what was afoot  Surely enough  Bobby Ellsworth  Overkill s frontman  was ill with pneumonia and wouldn t be performing that night or on any of the tour s remaining dates    Eh  it was shitty  n bitter out anyway  So to home I headed with a satiated appetite and a desire to snuggle with my lonely girlfriend whom I should appreciate more than I do    Until next time  Blitz     http   www youtube com watch v  WLQvzUux c  P S  I recommended to the personnel that GPA might do well to expand their hours for the Altar Bar concert crowd  Their inexpensive  quick serve  portable fare would likely go over well with the rockers of the  Burgh and therefore prove profitable ,5,2013-02-25
Great food  The Parrilla Mixta was great  Please give it a try  The meats were tender and delicioso  The people there were very friendly and attentive  I would return to this place  I recommend it ,5,2017-05-01
I m from Argentina  and while the food is certainly not authentic  it is extremely delicious  We go there as often as we can  The Americans friends we ve taken there were very impressed  whereas the Argentinean ones not so much  the meat is too pink  and the food too spicy for Argentinian standards   We love the asado plate  the filet Mignon sandwich  the sauces  the spicy seafood soup  and all of the sides  Their empanadas are not my favorite  they re too dry and the meat is ground too much  I m excited to try their paella  All in all  this is an awesome restaurant with amazing and fresh food ,5,2016-02-28
Just ate a lomo sandwich spirited to Philadelphia courtesy of a tried  true  and tested partner  The sauces arrived as well  Let s just say that I am in bliss  my chubby cheeks still evoking my recent flight to the far off heavens ,5,2017-03-06
What an amazing restaurant  A few friends   I decided to stop here after walking around in the strip  I ordered the steak burger with avocado   bacon  The staff was so nice   can educate you on the food you re ordering  My friends   I sat outside on their patio   beautiful day outside  The burger I got was amazing  I will rave about it forever  It was juicy  wood fire grilled   I watched the cook cut the avocado that went on my burger  Everything was so fresh    million stars for this place    I only wish it was bigger ,5,2014-06-15
I went here for my birthday and had the Bodega experience hosted by Alberto  Omg doesn t even cut the amazing reaction we had to the amount of food  the service  and the taste  So much delicious bread and meat  and don t even get me started on the bread pudding     LIFE CHANGING  If you like a fun family style atmosphere with smokey meat and delightful sides  then this is the place for you ,5,2016-06-26
Get the Parilloda Mixta   heaven on earth and you get to try a wide variety of meats   This place is BYO which I love   Hands down the best steak in Pittsburgh   I have yet to find higher quality elsewhere and the service is great every time   Be prepared to order at he counter   Chalkboard kind of deal and then they bring the food to you at your seat   Incredible experience   Wow ,5,2015-10-14
Great food  Very casual with a friendly staff  The roasted vegetables were amazing  I will definitely be back ,5,2017-06-07
Oh Gaucho  how I love thee   I ve been to Gaucho a few times now  but most recently to celebrate my dad s birthday following all of the renovations   For the building space they acquired  the amount of seating inside is surprisingly sparse   But who cares how close to other people you are when everyone is shoving their mouths full of wonderful  beautiful  perfectly cooked beef   We went with my parents  friends and ended up ordering TWO carne platters and essentially every side on the menu  as well as some grilled shrimp   It s hard to pick a favorite out of everything  but I think that of the beef cuts  the ribeye was the winner  and the sides  the spicy corn pulled ahead as the most unique   That said  there wasn t a single bite that wasn t spectacular   They recently applied for a liquor license  which is at once exciting and disappointing   I do love the fact that they are BYO without a corkage fee  but can imagine that they will come up with some uniquely Argentine cocktails to accompany the fare   I wonder where  exactly  the bar will be going ,5,2015-09-11
Fabulous  Loved the iced yerba mate tea  sirloin  potatoes and empanadas  The sauce Station was wow  Left with some alfajores to go  Great service and amazing food  Wish I lived in Pittsburgh  If I ever visit I ll definitely be coming back ,5,2018-04-28
This is probably my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh  Wood fired grill and delicious meats  What else could you ask for  Oh  maybe the most tasty sauces you ve ever tried  Yep they have those  Or maybe you aren t a carnivore and you are looking for something more herbivore ish  Well they have a full veggie menu    What about desserts   You say   Each time I ve been there they have been featuring a cleverly named dessert that was absolutely scrumptious   My go to is the Rosemary braised beef sandwich  I was overwhelmed with emotion the first time I had it  it s unbelievable  Everything there is  I wish I could give it a higher rating  Go there  Please go now  What are you waiting for  ,5,2017-08-09
Long wait line  too much talk At the registry that affect the wait line  Food was okay and the utincils were not clean  waitress was too rude when I showed her grease on the plates  forks and knives  she acted as giving me a lesson on how to clean them by wiping it with napkins ,1,2017-01-29
Amazing place   As Mr Trump would say GREAT   HUGE    THE BEST     We had the Asado platter and the Mixta plate  The meat was cooked perfectly with a great fire BBQ taste   The sauces were delicious and very light   a great compliment to the perfectly cooked meats   Come hungry as the plates were HUGE ,5,2017-10-12
Definitely one of the better restaurants I ve tried in Pittsburgh  My ribeye was deliciously flavorful and cooked to the correct temperature  It was melt in your mouth delicious  The chimis were awesome  Can t wait to come back and try more of their other offerings ,5,2015-10-19
I had to check this place called Gaucho out and I did read a ton of reviews on here  I also had a friend who kept telling me to try it  So  you all did a great job     Let me give some kudos to the staff  They could see it was my  maiden voyage  in the shop and they were helpful and informative   I went with the Carne Steak sandwich with NY strip in it  They add fried onions  red bell pepper and a special steak sauce  It was delish  I added a side of potatoes and loaded up on some sauces    I can t wait to go back and try another dish ,5,2014-07-03
Oh man  I finally got around to trying this place  It s been on my list for years  Through many boyfriends and bad dates  I ve been  meaning to try that Gaucho place    Well finally    I did  Awesome sauce  awesome sauces   We got the meat selection  we got the meat sweats  we died of happiness  It smelled so good  the whole drive home I envisioned myself lunging forward and tearing into the brown paper bag to get to the meat like an animal   When it touched my lips  I knew love  I knew this was what my mouth had been longing for all those years    Bad kissers  Bad sex  Bad food  Bad alcohol  Bad cigarettes   Forgot them all  I tasted this meat and I will never again be the woman I once was ,5,2015-09-04
Delicious  I ordered the braised Rosemary beef sandwich  The meat was flavored perfectly with lots of Rosemary  I was lucky and there wasn t a line  But I ve heard there are long lines  It s worth it   Also it is byob  I can t wait to go back and try other items on the menu  They make there own sauces too ,5,2015-10-02
Bottom line  if you visit Pittsburgh you have got to stop at this place   This might be one of the best restaurants I ve been to in years  Waited in line for    minutes outside and an additional    minutes inside  the food was slow to come out  All of this usually would result in two to three stars  But the food was amazing and well worth the wait  I had the pork it was out of this world I ordered the small portion and it was more than enough I left full  The flank steak was also very good  as were the beef and pork empanadas  They also give you side of toast with your meal which is great dipped in their sauces ,5,2017-05-27
I was walking from the hotel out to Primanti Brothers in the Strip District when I noticed this little restaurant   Hey  it s new to me   I thought   Let s try it   I d never been to an Argentinian place before but fortunately  the menu lists all the ingredients for each entree  I had Bife de Chorizo  one of the steak platters  I thought it was pretty good and decently seasoned  I also enjoyed the special condiments from the condiments bar ,4,2014-07-15
This is the cutest place ever     I went to the Chef s table with my friends and had a seven course meal  reservation only   It was an amazing experience  I can t wait to try the lunch and the Argentinian grill     What can I say the food was made with love  This is why I love small businesses ,5,2016-01-18
This place is absolutely AMAZING    The first time that I tried this place we came here for my birthday on a Saturday night around    The line was so long by then  I definitely didn t want to wait but my family insisted in waiting  We waited for about TWO hours before we ordered   paid and sat at a table  You also grab your own plates and utensils  We had ordered the   different types of meat  a couple of empanadas and rice  The meal was not cheap but definitely worth it  I really enjoyed the sauces which you can grab yourself and have as much as you want  After this experience   I came back a couple of times and tried the paella which was delicious  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone  It s a must try ,5,2016-05-20
The best part for me is the BYOB policy and its nice location near the David McCullough bridge  The variety of food is great with vegetarian and pescetarian options to choose among  I had a huge fish sandwich which was yummy  The only thing I wish there was more sauce on the sandwich or to go with it  The service is different from other places   you don t get seated until you order ,5,2017-05-26
A great spot with delicious wares  imperfect tables and utterly lovely staff  It s BYOB  so pick up wine before you come  if you re so inclined  Even on a Tuesday there was a bit of a wait standing in line  but it was excellent ,5,2018-02-07
Very good meats  With such a high rating  we had to try this place  It wasn t very busy  but we did show up half an hour before they closed  The person taking our order did a great job of answering all of our questions  The menu was on a chalk board and there were some things that didn t have an explanation of what they were what was in them  They were out of bread  so there was no bread for sandwiches or to accompany the plates   I ordered the flank steak plate  The meat was seared well to lock in the juices  It was very juicy and tender with a wonderful crispy outside  It could have been fine on its own  but I couldn t pass up the flavors in the sauces they have available as condiments  They made fantastic accents to the meat  Since they didn t have bread to accompany the meal  I got a bowl of saffron rice  I thought it was pretty bland  I traded a piece of flank steak for a piece of NY Strip on my colleague s plate  They NY Strip was just as good if not slightly better ,4,2014-09-12
Food was awesome  Seating was very limited  and the ordering process wasn t the most efficient ,4,2016-04-02
My favorite sandwich place in pittsburgh  I like both the fish and chicken sandwiches  Fresh   One time I asked for chicken empanadas  but the guy at the counter said he is currently making beef  so I was disappointed  but then in about    minutes he said he popped in a chicken empanada also for me    I was pleased    he is very nice  The meat is perfectly grilled on a wood fired grill ,5,2014-03-02
Gaucho has amazing food   a friendly staff  They don t take reservations so sometimes you have to wait in a long line outside of the building  but the food is worth it  Delicious food  plenty of options   anyone could find something that they would enjoy ,4,2018-06-09
There s plenty of photos of the Paella   The Paella served this past Saturday is much different from the photos here in on Yelp   No longer has clams  mussels   No longer has chorizo   The Paella we were served has rice  mushroom  peas  onions  tomato  lemon  shrimp   The Paella at Gaucho is a one and done for us     stars for the Paella   Bump up for the rest ,3,2018-06-11
I ve been about   times  good sandwich and meats  they can get a little too charred  i don t see why its such a high rating   its not a full service restaurant ,3,2015-09-29
This is definitely one of my favorites in Pittsburgh  Get there before  pm to avoid the long lines  The atmosphere is very chilled and the staff friendly  I love that most dishes come with a salad and toasts  Can t go wrong with anything beef ,5,2018-08-09
Argentinian meats are soooo good    Great atmosphere and decor  BYOB  great service and cleanliness for the shear volume of people that get food here  It has quickly climbed the ranks of Pittsburgh and established itself as one of the top restaurants in the city  Best part its affordable  they are not fluffing you witch extra cost or lack of food    I have always gotten the sandwiches and the empenadas  My favorite sandwiches     Braised Beef     Carne    Pollo    Fish       Empenadas are all really good     Dont forget to taste the sauces and use the favorite on your food   Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the Burgh  I always bring people here  ,5,2016-05-22
We went to Gaucho last winter     before the expansion because I remember it being so  oh  so cold  The small waiting dining area was probably about a   X   room  The     stools were against the wall and window  They also had a patio area that was open only in the summer  Anyway  I went back today and they ve expanded  The place so huge  So glad    no more standing around and giving someone the death stare as they are enjoying their deliciousness  My friend and I got the Chuleta Cochina  pork chops   Caldo del Mar  seafood soup   Brussels Sprouts and bread pudding  The pork chops can feed   people    it didn t come with a side so order one  I ordered the brussels sprouts  they were halved and then grilled      maybe   anyway  it was really good  The Caldo del Mar was good  there s a little bit of a broth on the bottom with   pieces of bread and then Mussels Clams and squid sat on top  We had bread pudding    it was good   can t say it s the best I ve ever had but it s solid    We were there at  pm right before the rush at  pm so I would definitely recommend getting there earlier  Parking wasn t bad at the time we got in and there are plenty available on the street    I m definitely a fan ,5,2016-01-07
Gaucho is a very interesting place with a cool concept  A big line awaits you when you walk in and it is not the people who are waiting to be seated but they are also placing their orders  You can order your meal and beverages at the check in counter and pay for it too  The waitress will get you and find a seat  Then someone will bring in your food and serve it at your table    Now I liked most of my experience but when you are looking for any service at your table  you would barely get any  Probably because I was there between   and    I don t know  The food was very good  I ordered small plate of camarones  shrimp   veggie empanadas and chicken sandwich  Their sauces are a must try   If not for their poor service at the table and the wait at the front  it is a   Star experience ,4,2017-12-07
Everyone was incredibly nice and the food was amazing  The carne sandwich was fantastic  especially with the different chimichurris  I highly recommend it if you re looking for a casual dinner ,5,2015-10-02
Wonderful experience  Loved the atmosphere  the service  and of course  the food  We ordered one each of the chicken  beef  and veggie empanadas  a Pollo Sammie  a Bondila  sp   Sammie  and a Rosemary Beef Sammie  We also tried the Provoletta small plate and sampled all four sauces  Everything was delicious  Like  really  really good  Suggestion   try to go between lunch and dinner to avoid the wait  We went at   and didn t have to wait at all  The only disappointing aspect of Gaucho Parilla is that there is not a location in my hometown of Charleston  SC   ,5,2017-12-31
Ridiculously delicious steak sandwich   Flank steak with chimichurri is the way to go   Only downside is the big line and somewhat limited seating   But you can call ahead for takeout and skip the line ,5,2015-09-30
We really enjoyed our meal here  The brisket sandwich and the coleslaw were amazing  The lamb chops were also good but not as standout as the sandwich  I found the potatoes to be somewhat dry  This is a fun  casual  BYOB venue with outdoor seating  with a fireplace  and good food ,4,2016-06-01
This place rocks the Steakburger  The beef tastes like the delicious beef of my youth  This reminds us of the steakhouses of B A  Argentina   You must order the Papas al Homo ,5,2017-08-02
We went to Pittsburgh to visit our daughter and her husband  They took us to Gaucho s for lunch  Although meat is their specialty  I was more in the mood for a salad  I had a roasted veggie salad which was excellent  If you re having the salad for a meal  make sure you get a large  There wasn t much seating so go when it won t be crowded or get your meal to go  Everyone else got pork  beef or shrimp  My hubby got a pork sandwich  I had a bite and it was really good too  This place is really popular and is expanding soon  The ppl who owned the place and who worked there seemed like they were very happy to be there  That always makes for a good dining experience ,4,2014-11-22
Cant say enough about this gem in the strip  If you want a great sandwich that is done correctly go to Gaucho Parrilla Argentina  Everything is done over the smoky fire pit they use in the kitchen  The owner a young gentlemen who works the customers in the front of the house is extremely knowledgeable and is a complete pleasure to talk to  I came into this amazing place on sat morning before they opened and hung out and talk to employees for a second and got a good feeling about the place  I took the advice of one of the cooks and got the Flank Sandwich with roasted peppers on a chibata  roll and was AMAZING  The thin stacked meat was cooked perfectly and just feel apart when biting into it  The meat was smoky but not overly smoky and could sill taste the Beef  The sauce they put on it was out of this world  Over All I give it   thumbs up  I cant wait to go back  Matter of fact may be going back today ,5,2014-02-12
Unbelievably good  I had the flank steak and roasted vegetables  The steak was thinly sliced  pink in the center and a great  salty  smokey bark and delicious sauces  The veggies were charred beautifully and drizzled with balsamic vinegar  Caramelized onions  asparagus  tomatoes and zucchini  We went at      on a Tuesday and there was no wait  Staff was super friendly and helpful  We ate out on a nice patio lined with plants and firewood  I m from out of town but I will definitely make a point of returning ,5,2014-09-16
We went last night   Tuesday at      we were told that the line is always long so expect to wait   Much to our surprise when we walked in and there were only   people ahead   For first timers the menu board is very confusing so if it is your first time look at the menu on line   We had a very friendly couple ahead who helped us out   The menu is broken into small and larger portion which helps   Sandwiches  steaks  chicken  seafood  veggies  starch  I chose the steak sandwich   You pick your choice of steak   I had filet  Mine was perfect   Another party member had the burger and he said that the burger was awesome  and another a steak and salad on plate  no bun     I would have given it a   but the steak had to go back because it was a medium and came back well   Otherwise    It was great   It s BYOB ,4,2016-11-23
Delicious   One of our favorite places to eat   It definitely deserves the high ratings it receives ,5,2015-11-10
Don t come here in a hurry  because it is not uncommon for there to be a line around the block waiting to order at this counter service restaurant   It is worth the wait   The steak and homemade sauces  try them all   are the must try items  but salad to shrimp to bread to side vegetables   everything else I ve tried here has been great as well  I just wish they served wine   You are allowed to bring your own alcoholic beverages if you wish to though ,5,2018-08-25
At Burgh  this is quite a great establishment  as both the meat and the decor are good  However  the long waiting line is partially due to the popularity  which I understand  but also due to an inefficient order system  If they can seat people  it will be much quicker    anyway  none of my business  Beef is above average though not outstanding  but lamb is recommended ,4,2016-05-08
Great food and service  Menu written on the wall looks busy and can be a bit confusing at first  Great variety of sauces  Will definitely return and would recommend ,5,2017-05-02
No seating  Honestly I didn t even eat here because the staff was rude  Since their front door doesn t automatically close they asked us to close it politely  then muttered loud enough for me to hear  this isn t a barn   I will not be returning if this is how their staff treats its customers ,2,2015-03-06
This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh   The food is good and flavorful and the staff is friendly   We take all our friends and family here when they come to visit ,5,2015-10-18
If you line up and start to think the wait outside is not going to be worth it  let me tell you  it definitely is   Cooked to order just the way you want it  great food even greater  Sauces    You will understand why you have to wait  Great service  great staff  just all around great place to dine ,5,2018-08-15
Amazing a bit of a wait but so totally worth it  Done forget to bring your own alcohol   ,5,2018-02-15
Carnivore paradise   Surprised that this place doesn t open more locations or other tried to copy the formula    line up  order and pay for your food at the counter  grab your little placard  fetch your utensils and sauces   and wait for a big plate of meat to be dropped off at your table   The place is BYOB as well   Outside of the sauces  they are good   I don t really know what makes this place Argentinian    it could have just as easily be an American grill   And I hear the lineups get pretty insane  but when we came when there was basically no line   I got the Parrillada Mixta  NY strip  pulled chicken and chorizo  for     for a sampling   On the menu  it says it s enough for      but I m a glutton   No complaints  just a good plate of meat and all the various sauces kept it interesting as I went to work   The service is EXCELLENT despite the order at the counter approach   The servers kept coming back to top off our water and checking in   There is a lot of hype attached to this place    but I think it s good in the fact that it simply doesn t fuck anything up and does it in a very self serve casual style   You re probably not going to get the  best  anything here   and you should expect it for the pricepoint   But this is definitely a place I would frequent if I lived in Pittsburgh ,4,2016-10-08
First time there  Will be back as the chorizo small plate was delicious  the Caramones were on point and the sauces I used on everything   There is a wait but definitely worth it PLUS it is a BYOB ,5,2017-10-26
The food is excellent as other reviewers have mentioned  but the experience isn t worth it for me  I ve tried them twice and I wasn t satisfied with either visit  but my first experience was truly unique   We went right before close on our first visit  so we weren t surprised that we had to wait in line  But I was surprised when they gave me a sign to hold and asked me to turn away any further customers in return for a free bread pudding  We had a few kids in our group and I didn t want to be argumentative  so I agreed to do it   Most people left after an awkward interaction  but there was a group of douchebags who were too privileged for the rules to apply to them  I m not gonna argue with douchebags for bread pudding  so I let the restaurant deal with them  Unfortunately  the restaurant let them stay  and we had to spend the rest of our time in line hearing them use profanity around our kids  It got even more awkward when more people showed up  and the restaurant let them stay too  I recommend just buying the bread pudding and saving yourself the hassle   I went back today for a takeout order  and luckily was not tasked with anything other than waiting  The wait wasn t unreasonably long  but I could see what looked like my food sitting under the heat lamps as the employees in the kitchen appeared confused  moving items from one bag to another  looking at the receipts  then switching bags again  Finally  one employee who looked like he was doing everything came over and repackaged my order  which was indeed the food that had been sitting under the heat lamps   On a positive note  the employees we spoke to were very nice  Also  that one employee was very good ,3,2017-11-08
I come to Pittsburgh annually for the Replay FX tournament at the convention center  I look forward to the tournament all year  but honestly  I look forward to walking over to Gaucho s every single lunch almost as much  The sandwiches are incredible  with bafflingly high quality meats  terrific sauces and great veggies  Friendly service too   Expect a line  but it s totally worth the wait  Honestly  one of my favorite restaurants on the entire planet ,5,2017-08-18
I m going to save the details this place is downright amazing  Probably my favorite place  Such a great value  Must try ,5,2016-04-01
Holly mother of Cool    I can say that this was one of the best steaks      Top    I have had   If you in Pittsburgh  head to the strip and eat some great food    OK that was the good     The bad    Well seating IS limited   And service is   Well not much once your seated   It is a laid back Seattle grunge vibe  Its a trendy   s something place  But it is well worth the time   Cost    It s cheep especially for what and how well the food is ,5,2015-09-16
What a wonderful find  This has fast become one of our favorite spots in the Strip  The food is amazing  especially the braised beef sandwich and grilled veggies  Long lines to get in but always worth it  So happy you guys expanded the space ,5,2015-11-08
Best sandwich in the city  I know we pittsburghers typically go after something with fries and slaw on it  but this is one sandwich that doesn t leave me reaching for fillers  Everything you need is in the delicious meats  Not a meat eater   Why   Try the veggie plate  Seasoned to perfection and happily drowned in an amazing sauce  Can t say enough good things about Gaucho ,5,2014-10-30
As Michael L  noted  it is quite uncommon for a restaurant with     reviews to have a   star rating  after my recent visit I understand why Gaucho Parilla is in this rarefied air  There s not much I can add that hasn t already been said by other reviewers  so I ll just say that their steak sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I ve had in my long and illustrious sandwich eating career  How such a small  ordinary kitchen produces such extraordinary food is beyond me  Just writing this review is making me hungry  so I ll end it now before I get drool all over my nice work shirt ,5,2013-11-04
What can be said that hasn t been said already   Great staff  great owner  and excellent food   Try to time your visit outside of the peak hours if you don t want to be in the crowds   Can t wait for the weather to warm up so I can sit outside    I walk all the way from downtown to the strip for lunch even in the winter for the sandwiches and now I have the office hooked   Bring a bottle wine or a six pack and enjoy ,5,2015-03-26
I can t add anything other reviewers haven t already covered   These folks know how to make an amazing sandwich  and it doesn t cost a million dollars   Hopefully you aren t a vegetarian ,5,2017-11-28
Food is great  Waiting too much for my order  Almost    minutes to order and another    minutes to receive it  I really do not recommend this place if you hungry    Because the I was alone the waitress asked me to move to a smaller table  that s fine  I got all my stuff and went upstairs and oops the other table was taken by other people  She was polite and apologized  I think they need more personals to fasten things ,3,2016-01-22
Great food and nice ambiance  Customer service is amazing ,5,2016-10-07
Everyone I talked to said this was the the best place for a carnivore in Pittsburgh  If anything  they undersold  Went there before the expansion  so had to stand in line outside in the rain  but was worth it  The staff came out and handed out umbrellas  Who does that  I m glad the line was so long  because it took me awhile to narrow down the choices  Will definitely go back ,5,2015-09-08
Loved this restaurant  Casual atmosphere with high end food  So unique  Great experience ,5,2016-11-12
Oh yes  Real grilled meat   Skirt Steak is my favorite   Delicious   Pricy thou ,5,2013-05-31
Food has ALWAYS been on point  I just wish the space was bigger  So much love for the meats but the crazy lines      are a bit of a deterrent ,4,2018-01-25
That chalkboard I tell ya   Ha jk     The meats      AMAZING   Seriously  if you haven t been here yet   You re missing out    I was a block away and the savory aroma was sending signals to my brain directing my path    Come eat meat    Hahaha  If you don t know what to get I suggest trying the Asado Plate  It comes with   different cuts of meat  It s kind of pricey but worth every penny  Split it with a friend   There are   different kinds of sauces  My personal favorite is the Chimichurri  a green sauce used for grilled meat  It s fantastic   And don t leave without getting some Alfajores  It s dulce de leche sandwiched between two cookies  It s like the the French macaron of Argentina ,5,2016-01-11
Gaucho is an amazing Argentina restaurant  If you want good steak this is where you should go  They also have amazing empanadas  They re different everyday and I ve yet to have one that isn t amazing  Try them with all of gaucho s different sauces ,5,2018-07-12
If you re a meat lover and you happen to be in Pittsburgh even for one day you have to try this place  Everything is grilled to perfection on a wood fired grille  Staff are friendly and nice  Prices are very reasonable  I ll give   out of   stars for sure ,5,2015-02-04
Anything you order at Gaucho is delicious  I have tried different things here and was never disappointing  Seriously  everything is great  I cant even pick one dish over another ,5,2018-03-19
This place was awesome  It has a bohemian feel and great customer service  I got the mixta plate which has pork chicken and beef  The sides are extra  Really great presentation and everything tastes so good ,5,2015-08-12
Came here because of the Yelp hype   and yeah  they lived up to it   Got garlic chorizo  chicken  and carne  filet option  sandwiches  and they were sublime   Rich  bold flavors that complemented each other and accented the meat well    Its a small place at the end of the strip  without much seating   I would recommend calling ahead and ordering for carryout ,5,2014-04-26
If you haven t been here  you need to make this restaurant a priority  Just walk in and get the smells and you ll know what I mean  I don t even know what else to add  I don t even want to get too wordy with a flowery description  Gaucho doesn t need it  They re just amazing  Why are you still reading this   GO NOW ,5,2015-09-17
Had the Rosemary beef and the shredded pork sandwich  They were both so good  The bread is fresh and crispy  The meat was juicy and so tender ,5,2017-08-04
This place is great with bonus points for being kid friendly  Order first  pay  and then sit down  Tried the empanadas  some meat  roasted roots  and a piece of bread with cheese on top  All of it was great and flavorful  I especially liked the self serve sauce options  with the garlic and onion ones being my favorite ,5,2018-01-04
I ve been here three times   each time lured back by glowing Yelp reviews and the line snaking around the block   Each time I couldn t figure out what I was missing   Was it the food   The ambiance   The service   Twice I even brought friends   Maybe they could shine a light on what I was missing   But they weren t impressed either   The menu is on a vast  confusing chalkboard that carelessly  and unhelpfully  mingles Spanish and English   The first time I ate here I was looking for the ribeye platter   I couldn t find it on the board  lost  amid the sandwiches and appetizers  so I ordered a sandwich     You order at the counter   Since no one seems able to decipher the menu  each customer peppers the cashier with a hundred questions  This makes the ordering process very  very slow and is probably responsible for the line around the block     The first time I asked for iced tea  All they had was bottled  so I passed   I thought maybe I d get another drink  but I couldn t see them on the menu  so I didn t know what my choices were   Water it was   I never did find out if they have anything other than water and bottled ice tea   Once you order your food  they bring it to your table by calling out your name  One time I saw three  Bobs  jump up at the same time to claim their order   Seating is plentiful   most people are still waiting to order   A condiment bar provides four different Argentinian sauces  a chimichurri sauce  a pimento sauce  an onion sauce  and a garlic sauce   The onion is the best  And you better like at least one  because you re going to need it for the dry  tasteless meats   The first time it was the ribeye sandwich   The bread was burnt and hard as an English biscuit  The ribeye was not tender  not flavorful  and was easily overwhelmed by the pound and a half of roasted peppers laid on top of the sandwich     The second time I tried the ribeye platter   I ordered medium   The meat came sliced  without a trace of pink   I call that  well done   The meat was much the same as the first time   tough  dry and flavorless  It compares to a sirloin from Outback   No wonder folk rave about the sauces  you need them to make the meat palatable     The third time the meat was just as bad as the others   Granted  at this price point I wouldn t expect Prime beef   But if you re going to use Choice or Select  you should probably spend some time tenderizing it   If skirt steak can be made tender  so can a ribeye   Shoeleather sucks ,2,2018-06-23
One of the truly authentic great restaurants in Pittsburgh  The food is delicious and the staff is courteous and engaging   The desserts are delicious too   Is it any wonder why this place is packed and so popular ,5,2015-08-02
I ve been wanting to try Gaucho for a long time   I ve heard so many good things  and it completely exceeded my expectations   The menu is extensive  there were many options to choose from   I went with the Parrillada Mixta so I could sample as much as possible  it includes NY strip  chorizo  and chicken with sauces and toast   Due to a minor mix up we also ended up with the Camerones  shrimp    Everything was delicious   The food was amazing  I m kind of mad at myself for waiting so long to try it out    We arrived around  pm on a Friday and had a small wait to order food  and ended up sitting at the counter to eat because there were no open tables   There were only two of us so this worked out well   The service was great   We didn t have to wait long for the food after we ordered and the servers were attentive but not intrusive   The line was growing out the door by the time we left  so I would recommend arriving as early as possible   Otherwise  you can expect a long wait  especially with larger groups    All in all it was a great experience  I can t wait to go back and try more of the menu ,5,2016-02-02
Drive by this place twice a day and before going in I would always make fun of the people standing in line  After stopping in in the late afternoon I will undoubtedly be one of those people that I used to make fun of  Everything about the meal that we had was phenomenal  Great atmosphere to match  Definitely returning as much as possible ,5,2016-05-15
One of my fave places in PGH  I always recommend this whenever friends or coworkers ask about casual but quality food places to check out  The steaks here are REALLY GOOD  Make sure you get all the sauces they have  and take some home too        full of lots of flavor  Gaucho gets packed superrrrr quickly   so either come here with a very small group  or by yourself  lol  or come at weird times  unless you re okay with waiting in line for almost an hour  I ve seen lines wrap around this place in the dead of winter so   you know its good  There s a decent amount of seating in the back  it s an order and sit down place   but they will bring our your food for you and help clean up   but be sure to have a back up plan in case it s crazy in there  Empanadas are alright  but what I come here for  is the steak   sauces and the roasted veggies  Go go go,5,2018-05-03
Amazing      the CARNE anything is the best  I d rather eat their steak over     downtown restaurant steaks any day of the week ,5,2016-06-15
You order at the counter and pay first  but the restaurant is nicer than that sounds  This place a cool vibe and good service   but the food is why this place has a line out the door    The empanadas are not the traditional ones I m used to   I ve been to Argentina several times  but they are good  We liked the pork one the best  The rosemary and garlic red skin potatoes were awesome   Much more flavor than normal boring potatoes  The steak was  really good  and the bread was crispy and spot on  The sauces were tasty and plentiful too    I highly recommend this restaurant when in Pittsburgh ,5,2017-06-18
There s a good justifiable reason this place is Yelp rated  I have more than enjoyed every single thing I have gotten here    My review is a bit late but here goes   When you walk in it may be overwhelming at first to understand but there is always an employee there to explain  You stand in line  while looking at a huge chalkboard menu and then order at the front register area  This is also where you ll get your wine uncorked if you re participating in the BYOB  which is FREE        Seating is all self service  and during lunch and weekends it gets pretty busy    So far I ve gotten the below  Grilled vegetables some of the most amazing veggies ever  Rosemary braised beef sandwich  probably a   star sandwich but still absolutely excellent  Corn on the cob  always good  Flank steak and ribeye  both half portions and plenty for one person with the salad and bread   ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE  I got them cooked medium and they were perfect every time    Definitely check this place out and in the summer they have outside patio seating as well ,5,2016-03-01
Gaucho Parilla Argentina is a hidden gem in the Strip District  We grabbed lunch here before visiting the Heinz History Center and loved our meal  This is a foodie place at VERY reasonable prices  We had the    empanadas  beef  chicken and veggies  and they were delicious  They were traditional Argentinian empanadas with very flavorful filling and nice crust  Our favorite were the beef which had a little bit of spice  For dessert we tried the chocolate chip almond cookie  and it was an elevated gourmet cookie    Great service  delicious food  and VERY reasonable prices,5,2017-05-14
Delicious  Neat little place   service with a twist  The menu is so big and on a huge chalkboard   plan ahead so you re not overwhelmed  We had the braised Rosemary roast beef sandwich and the fish of the day  The sandwich was amaze balls  The sauces  red pepper and onion  were great too  We will be back very soon to try more items  No issue with the line or seating ,5,2016-04-23
The food is      worth the wait   Great atmosphere and food  Obviously it would be nice if the space was a bit bigger  so the line is shorter  but I also think it adds to the uniqueness and small business feel  I ordered the carne asada and it was absolutely wonderful  Very tender  Love the fact that it s BYOB too  Would highly recommend ,5,2018-07-30
Food is good and I appreciate that they don t have a cork fee The food is pretty heavy and the sauces are oily so I always have a kinda upset stomach the day after    ,3,2015-12-15
My parents got steaks  I got the El Guacho salad  I like salads but this salad was really bad  it was just lettuce and oil and barely anything else  I didn t really want to eat it but it kind of seemed like a move it along place so I didn t want to take it back  My parents steaks were really good although they where on teeny tiny plates  I know everything else there is probably better than the salad I got but I m not really dying to go back ,3,2015-08-12
Reviews do this place justice  I ha e gone there     timesand I still have only ordered one thing off the menu  The carne  Basically the best tasting sandwhich I have ever had  Guys that work there are very nice  they explain the food the sauces etc    Everyone I have ever gone with has loved it  If you haven t gone you should  Check the schedule because it s not open all the time,5,2014-05-31
Just love it I have been   years ago and come back last night Food is phenomenal The best steak place in the city,5,2018-03-08
The wait was long  but it was soooooo worth it    I got the Lamb Shank with roasted vegetables and grits  This dish was phenomenal   The lamb was cooked perfectly falling off the bone  The vegetables were soft and yummy  and the grits were just perfect  They were perfectly seasoned and didn t have too much butter    Overall  it was honestly one of the best I ve ever had    I also got the spicy chorizo small plate  which came with toast and caramelized grilled onions and red peppers  It was so flavorful and had enough spice  Just get a good bite of bread with the chorizo and red peppers and you re good to go    I absolutely loved all of the chimichuri sauces  All   are flavorful and compliments the foods we got  I really liked the green one and the red one    If I need to come back to Pittsburgh again  I will definitely be coming back to try some of their other menu items ,5,2018-02-25
Went here for dinner   A little skeptical due to the line   It took a while to get in  But the menu looked good   Once we got in it was quick   The lamb was amazing   The staff was great   The flank steak was very good   The staff was very knowledge   Awesome ,5,2018-03-25
This place deserves all of the hype   I have been here three times and I am still enchanted   Both their pork and their chicken are unbelievable   They even make the toast noteworthy   Be prepared to stand in line  as you won t order until they have a table ready for you   You can expect at least a    minute wait if you line up outside   They are BYOB  and sometimes they even hand out glasses and openers before you get to your table   Yum ,5,2017-01-16
Where has this place been all my life  This was my first visit  If you like good steak  come here   If you like good food  come here  Their menu is written on this huge chalkboard on the wall when you walk in   My eyes gravitated towards their   steak cuts  flank  sirloin  skirt  ribeye  NY strip   so I can t comment on the other menu choices  yet         So once me and my dinner date got to the register  we ended up getting the Asado platter       which contains all   cuts of heaven   I mean steak  They say that s roughly   oz of steak   It also comes with three pieces of toast and chimichurri already on top     Service was so fast   And I was so fortunate to have come when there was no line  we got there around     ish on a Tuesday   We were seated very promptly  and served our food in a reasonable time too  I forgot to say that the ambiance isn t so quiet  so it s hard to have a good conversation in my opinion   The only thing I wish is that it had salad on the side like the individualized steak platters have   I needed some greens after downing more than   oz of steak   oh and UGHHH the sauces  Sososo yummy  just get all   and try them for yourselves   I wanted to cry after eating my first piece  Ahhh    just thinking about it now I want to go back   On the platter  they usually seem to organize the cuts in a certain order of sirloin  NY  skirt  ribeye  and flank   In my opinion  the most expensive cut  the skirt  was my least favorite  My most favorite has to be the sirloin or flank  as they were the most tender   Gaucho lives up to the hype   Stop reading my review and just go eat there already ,5,2017-05-18
If you need to celebrate with a meat parade  they have the best prepared meats   Get all of the meats and share with a big group ,5,2018-08-30
Definitely amazing  A little on the greasy size  but you have to expect that with meals largely made of meat  The grilled vegetales and entrag a were INCREDIBLE  Seriously  best skirt steak I ve ever had  The owner is really cool and does the rounds of the  tiny  restaurant  They re expanding into the space next door eventually  Also  it s BYOB so don t forget to bring your booze ,5,2014-06-03
Five stars  you decide  I just paid     for a side salad a sandwich and a small bottle of water  Keep in mind      There is  no tableside service  you go to the counter and order  get your own silverware  your own napkins  your own hot sauce      When you re done you get to clean up after yourself       The menu board is confusing  A majority of it is written in Spanish  Anytime you need to move around to order  get your food or utensils  you have to navigate  your way around customers who are huddled in front of the board with confused looks on their faces  I guess they don t speak Spanish either  And why should they  this is America   I caught them on opening night after their  big  remodel  Somehow it was easier to put up with these things when the place was just a little hole in the wall  At least it had character then  Now it s just un personal and way overpriced  While they may come up with some thought provoking combinations of ingredients  the food is just not that great  Cut the prices by     and I would give this place four stars  As it is  I ll give them a two ,2,2015-05-28
This is definitely one of the top restaurants in Pittsburgh   Expect at least a       minute wait if you re going during prime hours   I would recommend any of the sandwiches or the steak platters   I got the paradilla mixta  which includes steak  chicken  and sausage   I didn t really care for the chicken and sausage  the steak was the main piece   If I had to order again  I d definitely go for a steak platter   I also got an empanada and it was really good   They have   different sauces to try from and my group agreed that the red one was the best ,5,2017-12-30
If I could eat here everyday I would  I studies abroad in Argentina and this place is as close you can get to argentine food without actually being there  Their empanadas are the best  It s great that s it s byob and you can take your favorite argentine wine to pair with the food  My only complaint is their is always a line so be prepared to wait a bit to order  You can open your wine and enjoy while you are waiting though ,5,2016-10-02
Just super  We were visiting Pittsburgh for the weekend and tried this place the first night  The steak was so amazing we went back the next day for lunch  All   cuts are well worth the money ,5,2016-02-16
Our absolute favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh  Always worth the long wait in line  Some of the best chimichurri you ll ever have  do yourself a favor and get some extra toast just to dip in the sauces  I recommend the Asado Platter  good to split between   people when you order lots of sides  The empanadas are also great  but they do sometimes run out before the end of the night  so try to get there before then          highly recommend  Great food at a reasonable price considering the quality   quantity  Be sure to bring your own wine or beer ,5,2018-04-29
A solid     star  I got here at   am on Saturday just when it opened to avoid the wait  I made the right decision because when I got out of here at      am  there were people waiting out the door  Anyways  I ordered the Carne sammich with sirloin meat medium rare  which also contained the chimmi sauce  caramelized onion  and roasted peppers  The meat was really tender and juicy  and it was just the right amount of  medium rare   I could really appreciate the wood fired grill taste in the meat  Also  the roasted peppers were definitely a plus because they made the sammich that much more flavorful  The sammich was a   star  Now  the Gaucho Slaw was mediocre at best  It lacked somewhat of a flavor  and it wasn t the best slaw I ve had at a place like this  To conclude  if there s one thing I m jealous of Pittsburgh  it will be the fact that they have Gaucho Parrilla in their town ,4,2016-05-14
Got the steak sampler  It was amazing   This place gets crazy busy and it s pretty evident why once you ve had their food   The employees are funny and always cracking jokes to make the wait seem a little less long    They also have some great sauces to put on the steaks ,5,2015-05-06
Omg     I am so glad we waited in the line to get into this place   We showed up a little after   o clock on a Saturday and the line was out the door  we briefly considered going somewhere else but sucked it up and waited   You order and pay at the counter then they take you to your seat and a porter brings your food   There are not a lot of vegetarian mains on the menu  just a veggie sandwich  but tons of veggie sides   So i did what any insane person would do and ordered all the veggie sides and a side of toast   They were all amazing   Potatoes are always great  carrots with honey and goat cheese   amazing  mushrooms   fantastic   Will definitely go back and gladly wait in line again   ,5,2017-08-03
Absolutely love Gaucho  Got the steak sandwich with a side of the empanadas  I d been wanting to try their empanadas for awhile but towards the end of the week they sometimes run out  But not this time  Unfortunately I found the empanadas a bit on the salty side  so I m not sure I d get them again  However  the steak sandwich was fabulous  The bread was wonderfully crunchy and the meat was done perfectly  I m already looking forward to my next visit ,5,2014-01-19
Anyone who ever comes to Pittsburgh MUST eat here  It s absolutely amazing  I always get the some sort of steak and it s always made just right and with lots of flavor  I ve also tried the Caldo Del Mar which was great as well but a smaller portion  And the shrimp was good but not sure it worth the price for only a few pieces  The lamb was also made really well and tasted amazing  For dessert we usually got whatever the special was which turns out well every time  Oh and best for last  the chicken wing appetizer was incredible  I don t think I ve had better grilled wings before  You have to get them ,5,2016-09-22
My biggest question is why they bought such a small space for this restaurant     This place is packed with people and super popular and for good reason    We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and the rain held off long enough for us to get our sandwiches and sit outside to eat   Thank goodness   They only have about   seats inside and a small area outside the restaurant to eat   The menu is up on the wall  and I wish we had tried some of the small appetizers  bc they looked awesome   The grilled corn on the cob looked amazing and I was having big time food envy   But  we only ordered sandwiches  which were more than enough for lunch   This place is known for their meats  so I am here to let the veggie heads know they can also enjoy a sandwich here as well   The veggie sandwich is huge  with lots of great slices of different grilled veggies  They also have all the salsas out on the counter so you can try them all    Which I did    My husband got one of the steak sandwiches and was silent for about   minutes while he inhaled it     which means it was awesome    My advice is to call ahead with your order and pick it up to go   That is what we will be doing the next time we go  which will be sooner than later   It is great  but the seating is a pain ,4,2014-07-29
First thing s first  Gaucho has some of the best food in Pittsburgh  It s ridiculously delicious  which makes it really hard to write a poor review   Let s talk about their line system  They don t let you make reservations or write your name on a list  You have to stand in a line waiting  not to order  but for a table  I get it  It s their thing  their gimmick  it makes them seem exclusive and peaks people s curiosity  A few months ago I waited in that line for about an hour  and the quality of their food was worth the wait    HOWEVER  when it is a     degree August day  the line borders on inhumane  They have no Disney World esque signs to give you an indication of how long the line will be  which keeps people waiting because they think it can t  possibly  be that long  We stood in the baking sun for an hour and a half before even getting into the building  then waited for an extra half hour inside the restaurant  I watched people in line get serious sunburns as we waited  I watched a woman with a handicap struggle to literally stand up as she waited  which really made the whole thing feel borderline ableist  A worker came out with a tray of about ten waters  so at least ten people out of god knows how many were able to hydrate  They have signs that say that you can t hold people s places in line  so there are really no good options  The whole thing was a nightmare this time  and seemed like a lawsuit waiting to happen  I don t care how good their food is  no food is worth that   Also  I am the most easy going restaurant patron in the world  and would NEVER dream of complaining online when my order gets messed up  But when you wait in the baking sun for an hour and a half and they forget to put in your dessert order  then get it wrong when it finally comes out a half hour later while you watch the staff goof around  it really feels like an extra kick in the shins  I loved Gaucho but I can t imagine ever coming back  or ever suggesting it to anyone  until they figure out a more humane  kind  and handicap friendly ordering system ,2,2018-08-05
We are from Arizona  and can see why this place is so popular  It has a hip atmosphere  the people are very friendly  and the food was excellent  We enjoyed the sides of rice and corn  to go with our fish chicken and steak  We would come back if we lived in the Pittsburgh area ,5,2016-06-18
Although the wait was about an hour or so  we really enjoyed our lunch at Gaucho  The lamp chops were fantastic  and the sauces were delicious  The chicken was a bit dry  but the fish and other meats  as well as the salad  were very flavorful  The silverware  plates  and sauces are all self serve  and another customer accidentally spilled a large cup of sauce all over my white shoes     Thankfully  a waiter very graciously tried to clean it off with a washcloth and some solution  So kind  Loved the staff  Would definitely come back to try some other dishes ,5,2016-06-13
We had the empanadas and carne sandwich  The sauces are incredible  Killer atmosphere   very clean ,5,2016-03-24
Absolutely love this place   I ve been going for a year or so now  and every time the food is fantastic   The steak sandwiches are their main gig  but I highly recommend the braised beef sandwich as well   The sides are delicious and the outdoor seating is perfect   Great job  guys ,5,2014-10-30
This place is awesome   And they have surprisingly good fish sandwiches for your enjoyment over Lent ,5,2014-03-05
Heard about this place from other yelpers and a couple of colleagues  So  I finally decided to give it a try in the new year  We went on a weekday around   PM and were seated immediately  We had to place the order before we were seated  I think they expanded the place since it can definitely accommodate more than   people now  This is my first time trying Argentinian cuisine and I greatly appreciate the help their staff provided while we were ordering  They were patient and answered all my questions and infact made some good suggestions too   So we ordered shrimp cooked on cast iron and vegetable empanadas  The shrimp is coated with lemon butter sauce and it is tasty as is and the taste enhanced further when we ate it with the garlic sauce  It is cooked and seasoned perfectly  I could not try their shrimp over rice since it is for a large group but I am glad they had this shrimp on their menu which is a decent replacement for shrimp over rice   The vegetable empandas are herb flavored and have a unique taste  The filling was seasoned perfectly and the dough is cooked well  these tasted great with the roasted pepper sauce   They also have pomegranate orange drink that goes well with the two items that we ordered   Overall  it is a great place  Though it is expensive for the quantity  I will go back again for the flavors ,5,2018-01-04
After reading all the amazing reviews  I had to try it  The line was out the door  Everyone seemed to be talking about how good the food is while waiting  Total about    minutes wait  The staff were all so pleasant  I wouldn t have guessed they were busy if I couldn t see it for myself  The space is small  but we had no trouble finding a table  There s an outdoor space as well  The windows make the atmosphere so light and airy    We ordered the vegetable plate to split  Yum  Chicken and beef Empanadas were alright    i preferred the beef  The real star was the pork sandwich house special  Lucky for hubby  he ordered it  It was tender and favorful  I really liked it  I had the Carne flank cooked medium rare  Both sandwiches had so much meat  The sauces and spices added flavor  not super spicy like I thought  See pictures for more info ,5,2015-09-27
I thought this was a sit down restaurant and so asked   other couples to meet us there  Luckily we got there early enough to secure an outside table for     The staff there were SUPER helpful and friendly   We had   hardcore vegetarians in the group and we had plenty for us  The carnivores could not talk enough about how amazing the meat was  Super affordable   LOVE THIS PLACE   The portions are great  Its BYOB   which we loved   We ordered the porkchops steak  shrimp  and everything was amazing ,5,2015-08-31
Simply delicious  These dudes would make Gordon Ramsay proud and Pittsburgh should feel the same  Although I m an experimental vegetarian  and felt quite tempted by the amazing smell of grilled meat  I have been completely       satisfied on both occasions ,5,2015-02-18
My husband and I  in town just for a day and taking our college student son out to dinner  attempted here on a Wednesday only to find the wait too long   My son had an early start the next morning   The next day my husband and I headed there for lunch intrigued now to see what all the fuss was about   There was still a bit of a line but the staff was very conscientious to make each customer as comfortable as quickly as possible    We re glad we had the opportunity to try the delicious food and the flavors lingered with us on our journey home ,5,2017-10-27
Gaucho Parrilla Argentina would make an excellent ambassador for Pittsburgh s food scene to any transplants or tourists arriving in the city   It s simultaneously  a  one of the best sandwich makers in the city that stands out from the crowd and  b  a restaurant that fits right in with the growing and diverse offerings of an increasingly delicious Strip District   With many cuts of steak available in sandwich or platter form  I m a fan of the sandwiches myself   none of the options are bad choices   You could make random selections from this menu and still be just as happy as if you put hours into crafting your order   It s all great stuff  and I have no advice to visitors other than  get a steak sandwich and anything else that looks good to you    You won t be disappointed   The primary drawback is space  it can be hard to find a place to eat once your food is ready  especially if the weather closes the outdoor seating area   Still  it s worth the wait in line and the hassle of seating  though it s still a far cry from being  good for groups   ,5,2015-01-08
Dis place has some downright good tastin victuals  it does  I was almost hoping I wouldn t be impressed with Gaucho  But I must say  believe the hype  Ok so it s  th in the      Yelp Top      That means that it is the  th best rated restaurant in the U S  That is impressive  So here I am writing the    th and some   star review  Pthth  eye roll   Pointless  But I m a fan  I want it to stay up there on the list    So I was wondering  what could possibly be so outstanding about Gaucho  the meaning of gaucho is  a cowboy of the South American pampas   which is an extensive treeless plain in South America    South America is where Argentina is and Argentina is where good food cooking gauchos live          It couldn t be That amazing  The simple answer to that question is  everything  Everything about it is good    FOOD  Famous for steak sandwiches  Rosemary braised beef sandwiches  what I got  or just meat in general  not only beef  I also got a side of humita which is a corn pudding  The sandwich was huge with lots of bread and lots of flavor  It was slightly dry but that is fixed with the addition of one of the four wonderful chimmis  The chimmis are a complete winner here    THE PLACE   I was expecting a little hole in the wall joint but that s not what it is anymore since they did a massive redo  It s got a great atmosphere now  It s a super cool place with lots of wood design  Stacks of fire wood along the wall  wood floor  wood tables  and they bring your food out in wooden dishes  Your food is prepared fairly quickly and the service is great and the people are pleasant    Yes  every aspect of this place is nearly perfect  Everyone from foodies to farmers  hoodlums to hipsters  guess not much different there  will be impressed  There s no way you Couldn t like it  I now can understand why it s got such rave reviews ,5,2015-09-07
This restaurant deserves all the success and lines out its door  One walks in and is instantly greeted by a giant chalkboard of food items listed divided into  to meats  salads  sandwiches  and sides  I decisively decided on their steak sandwich with filet and then a  oz meat plate of flank  and it comes with a small side salad  toast  and tiny portion of grilled veggies   Depending on the cuts of meat prices vary  Strip steak is the cheapest to filet being the priciest  Ordered both meats to be cooked medium rare    While ordering you can see all the cute young chefs working hard grilling those meats in a modern clean kitchen  Sauce is unlimited and this place is byob even though they also sell beer and other soft drinks  They have wine glasses and beer glasses on the shelf along with plates and cutlery    it s self seating but someone still brings the food to you and will clean up after you    Oh man  the steak sandwich is good  They didnt skimp on the filet either  I knocked one star down because my flank steak was more of medium done than medium rare  Still very flavorful and not chewy  Affordable steaks here ,4,2015-08-26
I found this very interesting  I ve never had Argentinian food before  I ordered something that resembled a calzone  it had steak and corn and it was one of the best things I ve ever eaten   I would eat here again and look forward to trying some of their other dishes ,5,2016-11-25
What an experience   The food  the atmosphere  the courteous staff   you can t beat this restaurant   The pulled pork and corn pudding were outstanding  I highly recommend trying this restaurant  You will not be disappointed ,5,2015-07-21
This place was so incredibly good  I ve never eaten such delicious food  Went with a big group and they were able to accommodate us  It does get very packed anytime after    My only regret is that I did not order all the empanadas ,5,2017-06-24
This place is dynamite  We got the meat platter that offered an assortment of the steaks they have  Some were better than others but they were all great  Also  the sauces were phenomenal  The only thing I do not like is that you order at the front  get your own sauces  etc  It is kind of a fast casual vibe but it is a little higher priced so I did not like that we had to serve ourself for some stuff  But we will be back ,4,2017-06-08
Amazing    Some of the best food I ve had in awhile and a great deal  Definitely returning here ,5,2015-04-11
The best example of open wood fired grilling   You stand in line  Which I find hard to do with the exception of this place  order from a chalk board   Believe me  it is the one place worth standing in line  for unless your in the military waiting to get into the chow hall   BYOB  take a few friends  have a glass while waiting   It s worth the wait   I d suggest the fillet   It comes out sliced and layered perfectly ,5,2018-08-27
I took an older gentleman for lunch at the Gaucho Parrilla Argentina  The remodeling that was done to the restaurant allowed for comfortable seating and the service was great  I felt the sandwich s we ordered were over priced for what you got     yes they are big sandwich s but are mostly a bread bun with not a lot of meat  not satisfying for big meat eater s   I ordered a braised beef which was very tasty and my friend ordered a roasted pork sandwich which he felt was over cooked  dry   A server recommended next time to get a  disassembeled  sandwich on a plate which she said would have more meat on it since the meat is not stacked between the bun ,3,2016-02-02
The food was okay  It was very seasoned  kind of reminded me of Indian food  But I was really pissed that oil kept leaking from my sandwich all over my dress  Be careful people  You ve been warned  so blame yourself if you get oil all over your outfit  The prices are highish too  I liked that you could try different sauces  Wouldn t recommend ,3,2015-01-25
Ahhhh so worth waiting in the line  Great atmosphere and super friendly staff  I got an order of the lamb and went up to order seconds  Portions were smaller than I expected but so delicious I did not mind having to get up and get more ,5,2016-04-24
The food is excellent  the owner is a bit strange  You have to pay for your food in advance so if you don t like it  they make you pay for a new dish  I m not a huge fan of the trend and make sure you BYOB  They do not have any alcohol options,3,2017-06-09
The renovated and recently reopened Gaucho is bright  airy and spacious  yet retains the warm and welcoming feel of its former  more intimate  dwelling  I ve been talking this joint up to my family for months  and my dad and I took advantage of a Saturday morning tour of the Strip to pop into Gaucho at     hoping to avoid the scores of shoppers who ll undoubtedly invade the place later in the day    Gaucho lived up to my bragging  impressing even my culinarily spoiled pops  I enjoyed the super juicy flank steak sandwich  smothered in roasted red peppers and caramelized onions and soaked in Gaucho s signature Chimichurri  The steak was flavorful and tender and  while undeniably messy  combined with the veggies and bread to create a masterpiece on a bun  We split the spicy chorizo plate which was the perfect way to sample another one of Gaucho s selections  The chorizo was complexly flavorful with a mild heat and an intriguing mixture of spices  My dad raved about the lamb  tender and cooked to rare perfection  We washed down all the meats with Mexican Coke and exited onto a busy Penn Avenue stuffed  content and with plans for our next visit ,5,2015-06-16
Delicious  One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh  hands down  Basically everything that you can order here is delicious  so just take your pick  Really nice staff too ,5,2018-03-17
Dang well deserving of the five stars  Sat outside  BYO B  awesome staff who was enthusiastic  and some of the best meat I ve ever had in my life          would take a detour into Pitt again just for the steak ,5,2014-06-06
I am from out of state and wanted to try this place  It said it closes at    I attempted to go   times    got there at      wasn t able to eat  The next day got there at    still couldn t    Like wow,1,2018-06-14
The food is great  but the super trendy and hip environment is frustrating for someone like me  You walk in to a chalk board with a menu and random people asking if your ready then you feel rushed to read the chalk board menu wall  After all that you order and sit at a table where others can sit at and then yell your name   great food but the ambience is not for me,3,2018-03-06
Food is easily   stars  steak  sandwiches  tasty sides   there s not much more to say on this front  However  I have tried to go to GPA many more times than I have successfully eaten there   and I ve only ever attempted takeout  Even with the expansion  seating is a scarce commodity  but more frustrating is the takeout policy  On several occasions they have completely failed to answer their phone for stretches of time  rendering us unable to place a takeout order  on others  we have gotten through only to be told they wouldn t do takeout orders at that time due to long lines at the restaurant  I d much rather be told  it ll be    minutes because of long lines  rather then  no food for you  ,4,2015-10-18
Lots of talk about this place  My brother and his wife have attempted it a few times but the line was always too long  Another friend said it s one of his favorite places but you have to go early or on a week night    After browsing the strip for an hour or two  we made our way here around     on a Saturday  The line had about    people waiting outside so we went for it  I mean  a line means one of two things  slow  poor service and being unable to serve your diners in a reasonable manner  or the food is THAT good that it s worth the wait and that s why so many people are willing to wait  Judging by the reviews  I was assuming the second    It took us about    minutes to get to the ordering part finally  I got what my friend recommended  carne sandwich with sirloin  I split it with my husband and my friend got the pollo sandwich for herself  After ordering  we got sat right away  Our food came out in under    minutes  There were     empty tables in the dining area we were in during the entire time we were seated and eating  so this is where I begin to beg the question  why the wait  It took     minutes to order and we literally got seated right after  As did the group in front of us and the group after us  Food comes out quick  You eat quick and go  It s in between fast food style dining and normal dining so again  why is there this extreme wait  Yeah  the place is small  But it s a quick turnover  You get up and can refill your own water and grab your own sauces  extra plates  napkins etc so service time isn t the answer either  It just baffled us    Back to the food  it was pretty good  The steak was seasoned well and cooked to medium rare like we asked  I will say  I understood upon first bite why they have the deconstructed sandwich option  My friend s chicken sandwich was no hassle  but every bite I took into mine pulled the entire slab of steak right off the sandwich  And the onions and peppers  So I basically ate mine deconstructed style  though it was unintentional  I d recommend ordering any carne sandwich that way for future reference    I d say the sauces were the game changer and kept this from being an overall   experience  Pretty unique and all clearly freshly made  There was a sweet onion one  a roasted red pepper one  a garlic butter one  think Papa John s garlic butter dip on crack   and one just called  yummy  which cracked us up  but was indeed yummy  Reminded me of an Italian dressing  as it was thinner than the others  Having those flavor options to dip and spread made a difference    I wanted to be wowed by this place and have it be a definite   stars  While we all agreed it was good  that s it  Just good  Not good and worth the long wait  Not good and unique atmosphere or something quirky to set the place apart because it s much like any hipster  exposed beam decor place popping up in any city  Not good and I m already planning my next visit  Just good with some pretty cool sauces  Lots of people were getting takeout orders while we waited in the long line  perhaps that s the secret ,3,2017-10-15
Have you tried this place yet  If not what are you waiting for  I eat out often and maybe a bit to often if you ask some of my friends  But when I suggest we visit Gaucho everyone jumps to the opportunity    If you like meat stop by and give this place a try you WILL NOT be disappointed        ,5,2018-08-09
I finally got a chance to try Gaucho Parrilla Argentina  I d heard the buzz and I really wanted to check it out  I am pleased to say that all the reports I d heard are correct   This  Is  Good  Food   For what it s worth  I went on Tuesday night   I d tried to go before  but the lines can be VERY long on certain evenings  especially weekends   So long  in fact  that it is possible the last person in line will be holding a sign stating something to the effect that once s he orders no more orders will be taken   So go on an off night  or early   If you go on the weekend plan to wait in line   It s BYOB  so bring good beer or red wine   For my first excursion two of us ate  and we were able to share a few of the apps and entrees  I can now vouch for the fact that the chicken empanadas are tasty morsels baked into a delicious pastry shell  I can also vouch that the Rosemary Braised Beef sandwich is quite tasty  although the one I tried was ever so slightly too dry  That was easily fixed by dipping it into any one of the tasty house made sauces you can get at Gaucho   However  the winner was the Bondiola sandwich  Perfectly roasted and juicy pork  with spicy mustard and caramelized onion on ciabatta  This sandwich was absolutely a  WOW   My fellow partner and I both declared the Bondiola to be the best sandwich we d tasted in quite some time   We will be going back  and while I love to try new things each time I visit a restaurant I m going to be hard pressed not to order the Bondiola again   For dessert they also served a lemon pound cake  It was the perfect ending to an excellent meal although I can t vouch for whether this is a standard item or whether it was special that night  I therefore have to suggest that if it is available  get it   Overall the restaurant is comfortable  the menu is fantastic  albeit daunting in actual size as well as content   and the food was excellent  Gaucho Parrilla Argentina does it right ,5,2015-12-07
If you were to relate restaurants to the human body  Gaucho would be the heart and soul   It s kinda built out of the way  but you know you re there by the smell of firewood   The place itself is small  but boy is the food and service great   They brought the food straight to us  which is very nice considering I have a broken wrist at the moment   We got two steak sandwiches  which was a mistake  Even though it is SUPER delicious  we couldn t finish it all  We also both got Cokes  which the cashier informed us was made in Mexico  so it was made with pure cane sugar and no HFCS  Man was it good   We even felt the need to take a small cup of chimmichurri with us  Probably the best steak sandwich I have EVER eaten  If you need a place to eat  come to Gaucho Parrilla Argentina ,5,2014-01-26
Just stumbled across Gaucho when down in the strip  Tried the Veggie Con Pan and was a huge fan of the wood grilled taste   Lots of flavor and several vegetarian options   Nice to have a new lunch option in the strip a short walk from the office ,5,2013-02-02
Gaucho s food is absolutely amazing   I d strongly recommend one of the combinations of multiple kinds of meats   I love them all   As far as vegetables  I d recommend the grilled corn on the cob   The only real downside to the place is the lack of indoor seating   If the weather is nice  you have to try this place ,4,2014-12-04
Quite possibly the best food experience I ve ever had   for taste and value  I took two of my out of town friends here  both of which wanted to move to Pittsburgh after eating here  The quality of ingredients is absolutely remarkable especially for the price point  I don t think you can find better steak at Pittsburgh s most expensive steak houses  Pro tip   at no extra cost you can upgrade the salad side on a steak plate to the garlic roasted potatoes  I also suggest if you like your steak medium rare to get it medium  they tend to undercook  I would choose gaucho over any   star restaurant in this city or others,5,2018-09-27
Delicious little find   The sandwiches are generously sized and tasty  I came upon the place around  pm on a Saturday and there was only one other couple in the restaurant   My fianc  barely made it to his seat before they delivered the sandwiches to our counter   Both the steak and hamburger were well made and had great combinations of flavors   The guy at the register was quite the friendly chatty box  a welcome departure from the typical NY treatment ,5,2014-05-08
Do not miss this place if you are in PGH  Probably one of the best sandwiches I ve ever had  Do not miss our on the Rosemary braised beef  You will not be disappointed ,5,2016-02-13
This review is long overdue   I came to this place earlier on this year while I was in Pittsburgh working   This food is unreal   I came with a couple friends and we shared the meat sampler plate  which comes with all the different types of meat they sell  we also got a veggie sampler plate and two sides of potatoes   Everything was amazing   Especially their homemade sauces   The flavors are incredible   I want to come back to Pittsburgh just so I can eat at this place again   Seriously  Go eat there now ,5,2015-09-08

I came here on a work trip to Pittsburgh  The ordering process is a tad overwhelming  the menu is written on a chalkboard behind the cashier register and you have to make a choice QUICK  I recommend looking over he menu before you arrive   I ordered a flank steak which comes with a tossed salad  toast and chimichurri  I also ordered the Papas Dulce as a side  The only con to the menu is they don t serve alcohol  They have four dipping sauces which are all equally delicious  so good I was dipping with my fork before my meal came out      TIP  Grab extra napkins  you will need them,5,2017-04-24
Best food ever    Do not forget to order grilled corn and potatoes on the side ,5,2013-10-12
It was my first time at an Argentine place  I must say the steak was very good   Seating arrangements can be a little problematic  but overall this place is great ,5,2013-07-24
I have been following this restaurant for a while  I can remember when it had about    reviews at a solid five stars  And now it s over     and its   star rating hasn t budged    Finally got a chance to visit today  I had the pollo sandwich and grilled corn  It was incredibly good  Reviews are hands down accurate  You must go  That is all ,5,2014-10-17
Steak   Amazing  Sauces   Robust  Sandwich   Delicious   Empanadas   Heavenly  Atmosphere   Charming  Service   Pay order at counter  Is it the finest food out there  Maybe not  but everything combined makes this one of the best restaurant experiences anywhere ,5,2017-10-13
I ve heard great things about Gaucho and finally got to try it a couple of weeks ago  I got lucky and there wasn t a line when I went  so I didn t have to deal with the wait a lot of people complain about  My friend and I each got a sandwich and split them  so I got to try the carne and the bondiola  pork shoulder   The bread the sandwiches come with is incredible  It s a little crunchy on the outside  so it doesn t get soggy from the delicious juices from the meat  Both meats were cooked perfectly  melt in your mouth  They also offer you free  additional sauces that you can serve yourself  I tried all four  my favorite was the chimmi  This place is worth any amount of wait ,5,2016-02-04
SO delicious   SO good   The meat is beyond tender   The space is a bit cramped  but the hospitality warm and food is delicious   There is a rumor they are expanding soon   That will make this an ideal place for a lunch BYOB happy hour  or quick dinner ,4,2014-11-14
This place is great  I work nearby  They are extremely friendly on the phone as well as in person  The food is prepares in a timely manner  The food us absolutely delicious  I recommend the steak burger  I get carry out here in the reg  It s great to eat outside during the summer as well ,5,2014-12-19
Was good but absolutely not worth the wait    stood on line for two hours and another    minutes to actually get our food  I heard so many great reviews but I personally did not find it to be all that good   ,3,2016-09-11
Amazing food  Definitely a must visit restaurant in Pittsburgh  It s in a location where parking can be difficult sometimes but it s worth a few circles around the block to find a parking spot  On a normal day you can find the line out the door   BYOB which we didn t mind   I had a a simple chicken sandwich and couldn t believe how flavorful it was  I also tried the chicken wings  Cooked to perfection   I went with a party of   and we all tried something different  Everyone raved about their food   My favorite part was trying all the different sauces they have   No wonder this place is always packed  I can t wait to go back ,5,2017-03-29
I have been here twice  First time I went inside to sit  the second I ordered take out  I will warn those who are looking to sit down inside and eat  from  pm on there is usually a wait and a line that wraps outside the door  I would recommend getting there early or for lunch    The second time I ordered take out  This by passed the wait and you can walk right in and pick up your order  Food took    minutes  and the containers keep the food decently warm    The pork chop  was cooked well nothing to rant or rave about  empanadas have a firm texture which felt like they had been overcooked a little  the vegetable filling was nothing crazy  but the pork filling was really good  The shrimp and corn we re excellent  I will definitely be back but will be ordering take out to skip the wait ,4,2018-10-02
I eat here fairly often   Always excellent   Its tough to consistently get meats cooked properly to temperature    Gaucho never misses the mark   All of the sauces  especially the chimichurri and the smoked red pepper sauce  are excellent   Service is good    not Michelin   star dining  but prompt and quick   No complaints   Want a good piece of meat  grilled right  with some excellent grilled veggies   This is the place ,5,2016-08-31
One of the true gems of Pittsburgh  If you haven t noticed  this town is becoming a food town and the best part about that  is all the hidden gems resting around the city  This place is not even remotely close to being hidden  but rather  stands out the moment you walk by  The smells are intoxicating and the food is      quality  The service is always prompt   no matter how busy   and I don t need to say how good it is   all you have to do is walk by at noon on a Thursday to see the line out the door ,5,2016-08-18
Sooooooo delicious whether you like meat or veggies  I ve been in Pittsburgh a couple of times for business  and I try to make a stop here since I found out about this place thru yelp reviews last year   Amazing sandwich combinations and quality meats  The last time I was there I got the Rosemary Braised Beef sandwich  and it was absolutely delicious  Managed to finish the hefty sandwich because how tasty it was  Side veggies drizzled in balsamic vinegar was really good too  Definitely stop by this place if you re in town  Staff is super friendly too  I really didn t think Pittsburgh was such a culinary city ,5,2014-10-31
I m really unsure why there is such a hype about this place  I talked to my Spanish professors and friends about it and no one seemed impressed either  But yelp says otherwise  I came here for my friends birthday and thought I would give it a try despite the things I have heard  But it ended up being disappointing for me   The customer service is amazing  However  the food is not quite as good as I wanted it to be  I tried the yams and they tried to put some spices that just made it taste like flowers  The bread was dry  the fish I got was dry  The flavors were greasy and off  It was very heavy  They give a lot of food  but I didn t even want to finish it   They give you sandwiches in wrappers but then they give you plates anyways  So you just unwrap your sandwich and but it on your plate  What s the point of wasting that paper   Its definitely not worth the amount I paid  I got empanadas too  The meat was good but I ve had better empanadas other places for much less the price    Overall it was disappointing but the experience got two stars because of the great service ,2,2016-10-07
Why   stars  Because I was so sadly disappointed                       On a      scale  my anticipatory hype for visiting this place was a     I love red meat  I love Argentinian food  The menu was basically if I were able to custom design my favorite    things in the world  How could this go wrong     Ugh  The meat was oh so burnt  I went with the Carne Sandwich  and to be totally honest  it was barely edible  Even my peppers were burnt to a crisp  I should have gone back and asked them to re make it  but I was in a hurry to get to the Pirates game   So why   stars  and not   or    Because I try to be fair and not kill a business based on one experience that seems to clearly not be the norm    If I m ever in Pittsburgh again  this will be my first stop  I have faith that I had a bizzaro world experience ,3,2015-10-22
I wish Guacho wasn t so popular  so that it was easier to get into and enjoy they re amazing food  The flow of the restaurant is the only reason it s not getting   stars  you order at a counter that s right by the front  clogging up the entrance and almost always causing a line out the door   But I will always wait in the line because it really speaks for the delicious food  great ambiance and super friendly staff  Extremely authentic  Argentinian food means tons of grilled meats  veggies and some of the best empanadas in town  The fact that it s BYOB just tops of the reasons why you should definitely make your way over the Gaucho ,4,2017-02-27
Best steak sandwich I ve ever had and really good chimichurri      for a sandwich but worth it ,5,2013-11-20
The flank steak is the best  The chicken was also good  The empanadas and cauliflower I would not order again  Cute spot  Counter service  One of the better places we tried in Pittsburgh ,3,2018-09-19
I actually hated this place  Although the spices were authentic to Spanish culture  the menu was extremely confusing and overwhelming  I ended up ordering something extremely bland because everything said it was  spicy   Also  I don t understand why I have to order paella for a family of   and pay     dollars for it ,1,2017-07-15
This was one of the most perfect meals I ve ever eaten   The menu is simple enough but well thought out    The prices are exceptionally reasonable   Were this a full service restaurant you d pay at least twice the amount for the same food  The meats were flavorful  juicy and cooked perfectly   The charred toast was the perfect accompaniment   We also got the cheese and fruit board which was stellar    I honestly can t remember a more perfect meal ,5,2017-06-23
Fantastic   My flank steak was so tender and tasty  and I loved tasting the various sauces with it  Mashed sweet potatoes complemented it well  Nice atmosphere  not stuffy with a casual yet trendy vibe  Can t wait to go back ,5,2017-03-31
Everything is so delicious  Highly recommend then corn on the cob and rosemary braised beef ,5,2017-03-17
forget about  Best eats in Pittsburgh  Bar none  Come early though  especially for lunch  This place is crowded from open until close,5,2015-12-22
Omg looking at the pictures I took so I can post on Yelp and I m drooling salivating at      pm   this sandwich was well worth my walk in the rain  I got lucky because there wasn t a line  came on a weekday around  pm   I got the steak sandwich with onions on ciabatta  Bread was toasty and chewy  Steak was medium cooked goodness  Sauce was running through my fingers and hands  What more can one want from a sandwich  I should ve ordered two although one is quite fulfilling  Yum   I need to be back ,5,2016-07-08
Have been here twice now  I d give it       This is compared to places in Chicago  Memphis and Austin  TX  First time  we took out  Was okay The past time  we ate in  Went New Year s Eve  It was delicious  We had the Gondola and Parrilla Mixta  The line wasn t too bad at     pm  The other night it was out the door  By the time we left  it was out the door again  The difference between take out and dining in  the food was hot and delicious compared to take home being cold  The dipping sauces were great too    Large dining area in the back  Helpful staff    Will definitely go back and eat more and try other selections    this is definitely one of the better restaurants in Pittsburgh,4,2016-01-02
Food was delicious  Atmosphere was fun  We only had to wait in line for about ten minutes  but we got there early  around      p m   and it seemed to get a LOT more crowded soon after we arrived  I would highly recommend the experience  but maybe go early or be prepared to stand in line for a while ,5,2016-01-06
Wonderful sandwiches and a cool vibe   We ve been fortunate to get here at off peak times so the lines aren t horrendous  Love the green salsa  Thought the paella was okay  it really didn t hold up to the hype or the price  definitely better meats ,5,2016-05-22
What to get  deconstructed steak sandwich  grilled vegetables Service      Atmosphere  trendy  casual Wait     mins  Tuesday  PM for    Parking  street  The Experience   August       One of the best meals I ve had to date  It was worth the visit from out of town  I d visit Pittsburgh again for this place   Located in the Strip District     this street is filled with ethnically diverse shops and restaurants   There s a lot of one way streets in the area  so you may have to loop around like me to find a spot  I m a chicken when it comes to city parking  so I parked hella far from the restaurant  but it was street parking  Walking to the restaurant  Penn Ave is reminiscent of a smaller Chinatown  but a lot more than cultures  The place is at the very end of the street   If you think coming with a tiny group  aka party of    will get you seated faster  you re wrong  The line weaves in and then out of the entrance along the sidewalk  I m no stranger to long waits  but just a heads up if you want to come with people  If it weren t so popular and busy  I d come here with the girls for a girls  night out with an accompaniment of wine  It certainly looked like the thing to do when I was eating there and all the groups were merrily dining and drinking wine around me   I chose the deconstructed steak sandwich and a plate of grilled vegetables for some variety  The meat was PHENOMENAL  I need to learn better vocabulary for food descriptions  but the steak was perfectly marinated and flavorful  I could have just eaten steak for my entire meal  The crisp toast and marinated and grilled vegetables were a fantastic complement to the beef  Only way to improve this meal was to have a glass of red wine to go with it   I still drool over my pictures of the dinner I ate there and I wish other cities were blessed with this kind of luxury as well  I d say this is one of the key places to visit while in Pittsburgh  Nothing short of amazing ,5,2017-11-27
Wood fired authentic food  A gem in the Strip district ,5,2015-08-13
This place is amazing  The food is out of this world   I dream about it on a weekly basis ,5,2017-10-09
Interesting place serving great steaks  Argentinian style with multiple meet type such a sirloin  ribeye  flank steak  skirt  New York strip  You actually get in the line to order and then they bring the food to you  We got the combination platter of all the steaks which came with three pieces of yummy chargrilled chili bread  I wish this place had wine and beer instead of BYOB since we were out of town but we were lucky in that the patrons ahead of us were all too kind and gave us a half growler of beer  We also tried the passion cookie which was pretty good  Customer service was very good  Argentinian steak a little bit different in that they re thinner steaks fired on a chart grill and service sauces  I prefer reverse year and a big steak to get that perfect medium rare and enjoy it with just salt and pepper  however  the flavor of the sauces and seasonings were really yummy here and there are some days where I crave this type of steak ,4,2017-12-31
We have been wanting to try Gaucho for a while after all the great reviews and I got to sample some of their food at a previous Yelp event it was yummy   I was not sure what to expect and called to make reservations haha I hope they laughed at me  This place is so small and just a few counter tops to sit at  I recommend getting take out or going on a nice day when you can sit outside   With Growler in hand   it is BYOB  we waited in line and decided to take our food home as it was packed inside  def  a good sign    There seems to always be a line but the food is worth the wait  My only complaint is that we went around       be warned they close at   pm  and they were out of bread so no sandwiches  I mean come on how can you be out of bread   I was super disappointed but was one of the lucky few in line that got my sandwich on the toasted bread they did have left  When we got home the food did not disappoint and the rosemary braised beef sandwich was fantastic  Had enough to make   extra sandwiches with the leftovers  The horseradish sauce and caramelized onion are the perfect combo with the meat  I also got the grilled veggies and corn on the cob   I highly recommend the corn on the cob and will order   next time  My date got the flank steak which was cooked to perfection   The flavors of this meat cannot be beat  I can t wait to go back as I heard they are moving to a bigger location at the end of the month   Update   We went for lunch since they have expanded to part of the space next store   We waited in line of over an hour but were prepared for this   The staff could not have been friendly from taking our order to checking on us numerous times  I ordered the same braised beef sandwich this time they had the bread to serve it on and it was the best sandwich I have had   The new space has lots more seating ,5,2015-04-02
Gaucho Parrilla did not disappoint  I had high hopes after reading all the five star reviews and it met them  I had the carne sandwich with rare fillet  It was so flavorful  The smoked taste of the meat combined with the sweetness of the caramelized onion and the roasted red pepper was a perfect blend  The chewy bread adds a nice texture too  I added a side of horseradish for a nice kick  The owner was working and was so friendly to everyone  Overall this was a great experience and I can not wait to return  Give this place a try and you too will see that it deserves the hype ,5,2015-06-23
Omg  This food is amazing  The portions are large so you can share with your family and friends  You must order the mixed veggies  They have a great assortment of house made sauces  The staff is also very kind and accommodating ,5,2015-08-08
Awesome place for tasty MEATs  Grilled with real hardwood onsite   When you see the smoke coming out of the stack you get what you smell   Very small and intimate only a handful of seats but worth the trouble   Tastes were heavenly with caramelized onions and fresh crusty breads   The gentleman at the counter works the room like a carnival barker but takes great care of the orders   Great prices and fairly good selection of meaty delights ,5,2014-01-21
Came here on a weekday night and the line wasn t as bad as I had anticipated based on other reviews    Items I recommend    Beef empanadas  beef wins over chorizo in my opinion  I would almost always choose chorizo over beef in any circumstances  but the balance of flavor was better in the beef empanada   El Gaucho salad with steak added  I highly enjoyed each bite of this salad that contained radish  asparagus  bunch of leafy greens  carrot strips  and avocado  tossed in a light dressing  One bite of medium rare  or whatever other shape or form you like your meat  steak followed by a massive bite of vegetables made me feel much proud of myself for eating veggies because I actually really would never pay money to buy myself a salad  But this one was worth it     Sauces  try all the sauces and put it on everything whether it s empanada  steak  your fork  or whatever  Find out which sauce speaks to you the most and discuss it with your company for meaningful conversations    If I come here another time  and everything tastes consistently amazing  I will upgrade my rating to a five star   Oh  and BYOB ,4,2017-10-12
After yelping and checking out trip advisor  this seemed like a must go to when in town  Sure enough  with a group of people  we decided to check it out  Needless to say  we were not disappointed  There was a wait for about   ish mins but it was worth it  We all got sandwiches and they were all really good  Crane sandwich had excellent reviews so I figured why  not  It really lived up to its reviews  We also got a set of empanadas on the side and  mouth watering  definitely a must ,5,2017-02-21
It was about six degrees today  so when we got to Gaucho and saw the line of people waiting outside I knew it had to be wonderful  My boyfriend and I shared the parrilla mixta  a side of papas  and some empanadas  It was the best meal I ve ever eaten  and the sauces are absolutely amazing ,5,2016-02-14
Opening tip  try mid afternoon   We arrived around      on a Friday afternoon  I loved the experience of walking into the space  hardwood floors  brick walls  wrought iron chandeliers  high ceilings  chalk board menu and well merchandised sauces  There s so much from which to choose that we decided on three menu items  but be prepared to order your drinks first  I had the small flank steak  which was around      He had the small ribeye which was      I think  We also ordered the small camarones for      They ask for your name and then you find a seat  Before you grab your seat  grab silverware  We didn t have a problem finding a place and opted to sit upstairs  which was open and had a variety of tables  some that could accommodate       maybe more   so you can easily dine with groups  At each table you will find a napkin dispenser and a fresh flower  Note  you WILL NOT find steak sauce  salt or pepper so don t be that person     Our steaks were ordered  and arrived  medium and served with ciabatta bread and salata with an amazing balsamic dressing  The ciabatta was hard so I let it soak up some of the chimichurri sauce  The steaks were perfectly prepared and sliced  The presentation on the wooden platters was clean and inviting  We shared a bite of our steaks and we preferred our own  I loved the camarones doused with lemon    Highly recommend Gaucho to anyone ,5,2015-07-18
The ordering system is a little much at first  I recommend going with someone who has been there so they can help you along   The staff behind the counter was friendly and offered to answer any questions I had  There is an older fella  owner maybe   who seemed a tad overbearing in terms of making sure customers were doing what they need to and going where the need to  I appreciated his direction  but he came off a little high strung   I ordered the smoked pork belly special  It was tasty  excellent texture  nice mix of crunch and soft  gelatinous fatty goodness  Nice flavor  subtle smokiness and pretty salty  The potato side was forgettable  but the cabbage side was awesome  Great sweet savory mix  with little crunchy pork bits throughout  Yum ,4,2017-01-20
There is no way to overestimate how good this place is  The steak sandwiches are juicy and delicious  We ve tried the filet mignon  ribeye and skirt steak sandwiches and it really just comes down to what cut you prefer    We tried the provoletta and it should not be missed  grilled and melty sharp provolone is placed atop grilled ciabatta bread  it s as delicious as it sounds    The house made sauces are amazing  this trip we bought a container to bring home with us    The place is small so either eat off hours  plan on waiting for a table outside or get it to go    Eat here now ,5,2014-05-30
The food is worth EVERY MINUTE of waiting in the line that frequently wraps around the building  I ve been to Gaucho for both lunch and dinner  both were equally out of this world    The lunch portions are just right  I had the ribeye served mediun and it was excellent  I love the appeal of the wooden plates  I tried the Argentino salad for dinner  which is essentially Argentina meets Yinzer  as it is a salad with steak  avocado and papas  I plan on visiting again with a group to experience the paella  PS  great double date idea  and to take advantage of their BYOB policy ,5,2016-07-27
Delish  Everything was great  The veggies were Cooked to perfection with lovely seasoning  Loved the Brussel sprouts  the chic   Steak  toast and rice   The wait was way to long almost   hr  The service is so very friendly  You wait on line to place your order and then wait to be seated and the staff brings your food  BYOB,4,2015-12-07
The food was good  but waiting in line for over an hour to be seated really ruined my experience  A little on the pricy side too  lunch for two was roughly      I had a steak sandwich  a side and she had the flank steak  Would I try them again  Yes  but definitely not during lunch hours on the weekend    If you get a sandwich  you should know it basically arrives on an entire loaf of bread  Plenty for two people ,3,2018-09-17
Favorite Pittsburgh lunch spot  I ve never had a bad experience  Staff is friendly  meat is top quality and perfectly cooked  the sauces are to die for  and it s byob  Red meat and red wine is winning combo in my book  The prices are also very reasonable when you consider the quality  It s def worth standing in line ,5,2018-03-22
I don t know if I visited on an off day or what  but I was very much let down by the food here after reading all the fantastic reviews  The staff and overall experience were great  but the food just didn t cut it for me   I visited with a group of four friends and I ordered the pollo sandwich and the vegetable and chicken empanadas  The sandwich was huge  but the flavors weren t very sophisticated and I didn t  really think they worked that great together  Plus the bread plus all the meat made for a pretty dry sandwich  The empanadas were similarly monotonous in flavor  regardless of filling  and the dough outside was oddly hard  My friends found their meals good but not fantastic   Based on all the great reviews  I was so ready to fall in love with this place    maybe I will give it another chance sometime ,2,2015-09-14
Superb  Everything I tried was excellent  Will return again and again  The shrimp was excellent  the meats cooked to perfection and everything had so much flavor  Fresh ingredients does that to food  Can t wait to return and bring a few friends ,5,2015-11-26
Basing my opinion on a one meal experience  this place is overrated  I ordered the sirloin medium rare  small       This was the only good part of the meal  A piece of burnt  tough bread was served with the meal  The salad that came with the meal was fair    I ve passed this place several times when they were busy and chose      PM on a weekday to try it  The menu is varied but if all the bread is burnt and tough I doubt if a return trip will happen ,2,2017-06-21
Fantastic sandwiches and salads  line wasn t too long but we waited awhile be prepared to wait outside if the line is long  Order and pay then are seated and they bring you your food  Unique menu great variety of sauces and flavors  My sandwich was fabulous and we loved the empanadas as well   Great variety  casual   trendy decor great place to eat if your shopping in the strip,5,2018-04-06
Wow  Absolutely delicious food at great prices  The carne sandwich was awesome     filet mignon  chimi sauce  onions  and peppers stuffed into a ciabatta  Service is very fast and friendly  They have good looking veggie options here  too  If you re in Pittsburg  you should come here ,5,2014-10-04
Whoever thought it d be okay to have a copious amount of meat for breakfast is just sick in the head  and I m all for it  On a summer weekend road trip to Pittsburgh  said no one ever     friends and I went on a food excursion through the city of steel  Gaucho was a big surprise to me having grew up in Los Angeles and not expecting such an eclectic array of eateries in a place like this  We lined up right before they opened and got in after around    minutes  just the perfect amount of time to build up an appetite  We got the sampler and a side of okra  just to appease my flexitarian appetite   Yum yum and yum  The meat has just the right amount of charcoal and steam  with its juice oozing out right before your eyes  You can feel the warmth of the slab of steak before taking a bite  what a treat  Do note that this was an incredibly sodium tastic meal  I d say they could use less salt for their dry marination  And don t forget the salsa  try em all ,4,2018-03-29
The food is delicious here  Super tender  moist meat with a slice of grilled bread  What could be better  Definitely get the Brussels sprouts  I don t know what they do to them  but they are soo good  The problem is the service  You wait outside in a long line only to be rushed as you eat  We even got asked by the server when we were going to leave because there were all lot of people waiting outside   but I was one of those people too  I wouldn t go back ,3,2018-03-28
Hands down best bit of ribeye i have ever had      Get the humitas too if you like a little spice   everything here is cooked to perfection,5,2015-09-11
Seriously one of the best sandwiches I ever ate  and if you getting lunch make sure you there before    or you will be staying in    minutes line,5,2016-06-28
After     reviews at the time of this writing  and with     stars  I don t think that I have too much to add on the awesomeness of this place that hasn t been said numerous times before   I will say that they have recently enlarged the seating area   but I went around      pm on Weds  and it was still pretty packed   People love this place  and for good reason   Authentic  hearty  unpretentious  great grilled charred flavor  BYOB at no charge  fast service   that alone puts it in the top restaurants in Pittsburgh    I went on a hot summer day  and I will say that while it was air conditioned on the inside  I was quite warm   The ac is lined on one side of the upstairs room  and is not so easily felt on the other side   It is also a bit loud   but then I suppose that is to be expected when there are sooo many people wanting in that place   These were very minor inconveniences given that the food was so good   I would like to add that the overall costs for this place are very reasonable for the quality of food that you are getting    Value is even better since there is no alcohol served here  and there is no corkage fee to bring your own alcoholic beverage   In addition  there is no real wait staff  only a few servers and a busboy   I think for this reason many people may not leave a tip   but there is a tip jar at the front by the cashier   Normally  I am not a fan of most tip jars  as many places seem to have one for no reason at all   but assuming that the busboys and servers get a portion of it  I happily left one   All of the staff here were friendly and helpful  and I hope that others reading this will realize that and leave a few bucks for the hard working staff here ,5,2015-09-03
Tbh don t really have words for this place  The food is ridiculous  Insane   I got the carne sandwich and my boyfriend got the lamb chops   both done perfectly with just the right amount of pink  The sauces help to make the meal  try all     you really can t go wrong   Service was also extremely friendly  attentive and always ready to answer your questions and help you in any way possible  The only downside  and the reason it didn t get   stars  was the wait  I spent a total of   hours there  most of them which was waiting for the cold  but that isn t really their fault  and it s obvious that the food is just so good that everyone is willing to wait  I cannot wait to go back but preferably not on a Saturday night this time so I don t have to wait     years,4,2016-11-13
First time in for a quick lunch before a flight  I ordered the braised rosemary beef sandwich  the fried provolone to share  and my Lunch date ordered the lamb  The food was giant and just as tasty  The beef was squeezed between two buttery slices of bread and topped with a creamy horsey sauce  with caramelized shallots ,5,2018-09-04
Food is     stars  totally amazing   The front desk  however  should not encourage patrons to sit on the patio  Flies  fleas  little black bugs all over the place  which completely downgraded the experience from a    to about a     There is no reason they can t assess the bug situation on the patio and close it down when it s infested with flying bugs that are all over the food   We ate and got out of there as quickly as possible  Sit inside ,4,2017-08-15
You want to know what I really appreciate about this meat centric restaurant   The sauces      I have been to other churrascaria style or meat oriented restaurants here and in other parts of the US   I m not going to mention names   One local one starts with G  and to ingest a plate full of potential heart attack substances without additional flavoring is ridiculous   I know that some of you purists are going to say that the quality of the meat should speak for itself  but I don t agree  Just like I like my coffee with a flavored creamer  I want my meat with a lil sumthin  sumthin on the side   Much like a an adulterer   but I digress     This place has not one  not two  not three  but FOUR different sauces that you mix and match and slather dip gently brush bathe your freshly grilled meats in   I love that   I have been hearing about this restaurant for a while  but it kind of dropped off of my radar for more than a minute    So many restaurants  so little money  but now that I m back to my weekly habit of visiting the Strip District  I decided to stop in   I noticed that the menu wasn t expansive  but I still had a problem deciding what I wanted to eat   Del Mar  Of the Sea  or De La Tierra  Gaucho s interpretation   Not of the Sea    Hmmm  meat platter  seafood platter  sammich  what to do     After much time and deliberation  I decided to go with the Rosemary Braised Beef sandwich  Maiz  Grilled Corn on the Cobb  and two steak empanadas   I also scarfed up samples of each of the sauces     Call me Vampire Killer because I love garlic and that Ajo  garlic  sauce is drinkable in my opinion   The chimichurri sauce and the cebolla  onion  sauce were also excellent   The Rosemary Braised Beef was smoky  flavorful  tender and well balanced with the addition of caramelized onions and horseradish sauce   Yeah  I know another sauce   but it was good    All corn should be grilled and seasoned the way Gaucho does it   The only downer that I had was the steak empanada   I bought two  one for myself and one for my daughter Muff and they were a little dry and overwhelmed by the taste of olives   I love olives  but the olive taste wasn t balanced out by other flavors  so it was just bien   okay    After I raved about the restaurant to my sister  I had to take her there this past Saturday   Not only did I reorder the same sandwich and grilled corn  I tasted some of my sister s Gaucho Papas  Seasoned Roasted Potatoes  Ay  Papi were they good     Service at Gaucho s was extremely friendly and welcoming  with the staff more than willing to explain everything about their menu in detail   The place is minutely small and you have to go outside to change your mind    The size of the place and empanadas is my only reason for a   rating   All in all though  a very wonderful experience and you can t go wrong with the food there   Besos  kisses  to the chefs and owners ,4,2014-10-21
This is truly a great restaurant  The steaks were perfectly cooked  Very tender  We got the small plate ribeye  The grilled shrimp was out of this world delicious  The roasted red potatoes were so tender you could smash them with a fork  The wait staff was extremely attentive and friendly  I was also very impressed with the manager as she was helping clear tables and sweeping the floor  Great example for her staff  Will definitely go here again  A word of advice  for dinner try to get there before   or you will be in line forever ,5,2018-07-14
Amazing food  Don t let the long lines stop you  Loved the tender well seasoned steaks and salads  Can t wait to go back ,5,2016-12-26
walked out after twenty minutes waiting with ONE party out of at least ten other parties inside visibly having ordered  someone came around to offer  skipping the line  and get the     head prix fixe menu   are you kidding me   who in their right mind goes anywhere offering a prix fixe menu that makes you wait in the damn street   nothing  NOTHING is good enough to justify that line  that wait  and a terse sign at the door whining about how  we know it s cold out  that s why coats were invented   get a bigger venue   sizing down for  exclusivity  just makes you look like a dick,1,2017-03-16
I don t feel the need to say anything more than what has already been said time and time again about this place   The best steak sandwich I have ever had   Period   Ribeye steak sandwich  don t mess around  put chimichurri on it   The end ,5,2014-10-15
The restaurant has a nice atmosphere  laid back  Staff is friendly  The food is good ,3,2015-06-24
This is a place where food definitely trumps service   They have a takeout option  but no one seems to answer the phone  so you d have to come in a wait in line anyway   With the length of the line for this place on any day  you can see this business can t really handle the volume of customers it serves or even a possibly growing customer base ,3,2015-06-23
Food amazing  ambiance amazing and did I mention the food is amazing   The staff is friendly and quick  It s a byob so that is a huge plus,5,2018-03-25
Great spot  The smoke from the wood fired grill grabs anyone s attention who is walking by  The staff is all very friendly   The food is amazing   so much flavor packed in generous portions  You can taste that only top quality ingredients are used   I try to go here at least once a month for lunch and it never disappoints  The line sometimes can get big but that s to be expected when you have such good food ,5,2016-11-23
Sandwich and salads so good that they re addictive    The line usually out the door but so worth the wait   ,5,2018-07-02
Great atmosphere  very clean  staff very friendly    I had the Cordero  medium rare  Two double lamb chops came out a perfect medium rare  There was a nice char on the outside  unfortunately this carried over to the frenched rib bones  Two were burnt off when it came out  the other two fell apart on the plate  Not appetizing  The meat was under seasoned    The accompanying small casa salad was tasty  especially liked the grilled grape tomatoes  Dressed perfectly  a little understated  as I prefer    Grilled corn was under seasoned as well  and there isn t any salt and pepper to be found  Could have used a bit of char on it  They could have used some of that tin foil it was wrapped in to protect the lamb rib bones      Gaucho papas were delicious  Wouldn t change a thing  They were grilled perfectly  I loved the seasoning  and the oil was decadent  Nice sized portion for three bucks  Plenty to share    They have a small selection of self serve sauces  well balanced and diverse  I thought they were very flexible and all complimented every menu item in a different fashion  Very oily  but great with the meats    I will definitely go back  Baby Girl brought me a chicken sandwich home about a month ago  and I crushed it  Shredded chicken and ajo sauce on that grilled ciabatta  I was so full I couldn t eat the rest of the day  Killed it ,3,2015-08-22
I ve been here several times and each time  the food is delicious  Having to wait in line for so long is the only downfall and why we don t go here more often ,5,2018-03-04
My wife and I came here with no knowledge of the establishment beforehand  but on the basis of a recommendation  We both enjoy Argentinian food generally and a good steak especially  we were going somewhere closeby  so why not  What I have to say about this restaurant  very simply  is  IT S NOW OFFICIALLY MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT  Read about the great food in all the other reviews  We second them all  Steaks tasty  tender  and succulent  nice portions  wonderful bread and other accompaniments  A great aspect  when there was a problem with one of our steaks  they took it back and produced a new one in a matter of MINUTES and it was absolutely perfect  If you like this kind of fare  you will love this restaurant  Can t wait to go back  Tip  no liquor licence  yet    but bring your own red wine and enjoy  Very accommodating ,5,2015-08-09
I tell everyone that this is literally the best restaurant in all of Pittsburgh  If the great reviews here don t tell you that  then the line out the door on a weeknight might  This is not your standard restaurant in that the menu is gigantic and written on the wall when you first come in  You order your food and have a seat  it s BYOB   and they bring your delicious food out to you as you wait  Thankfully over the past year they have significantly expanded the dining room  there really wasn t one before  and have great outdoor seating  The food itself is excellent  The steaks are always cooked to the right temperature and the sides are outstanding  Our favorites are the potato wedges and the corn on the cob  The sides change frequently based on seasonal ingredients  We have tried many different items here and everything we have ever had has been excellent  with the exception of the empanadas which were just OK and a side of roasted peppers  which were just a bit too oily   But the meat is always on point My husband loves to get the strip and the ribeye and I ve had both of those  shrimp  and paella and it was awesome  Two enthusiastic thumbs up ,5,2016-05-21
Amazing  This place is worth the wait and certainly lived up to the hype  Everything is so flavorful  The ribeye plate was excellent  Also recommend the potatoes with garlic and rosemary  Tried it for lunch and can t wait to come back for dinner sometime  The small ribeye plate and side of potatoes was the perfect sized lunch for two to share ,5,2017-03-19
This place is ranked    on America s top     in      by Yelp itself   For good reasons  When we arrived on a Friday around      PM there was still a line out the door    I can only imagine how busy it is during prime lunch and dinner hours   The atmosphere is pretty hip and casual  and the restaurant looks newly renovated    We were in a rush so we opted for sandwiches  ribeye and rosemary braised beef   These are now my favorite sandwiches without any exaggeration  Since they make their meat to order expect to wait around    minutes for takeout  but it is certainly worth it   They do their sandwiches extremely well   from the bun through the meat   everything is perfectly thought out   Probably now my favorite food place in Pittsburgh ,5,2015-07-05
if I can  I will eat Gaucho everyday  EVERY DAY  the steak burger is out of the world  for    bucks  i m the happiest person on this planet  after the renovation  they have introduced some new dishes  I have tried Parrilloda Mixta and the potato salad  they are both really yummy  it s definitely one of the best restaurants in pittsburgh ,5,2015-07-31
This is not your typical sit down restaurant  When you get there you wait in line and then place your order  After your order is placed the staff then sit you at a table  We went on a Thursday night  The line was not that long  but we still waited about    minutes to place our order  The restaurant is BYOB so if you want something to drink make sure you bring a bottle of wine or beer  My husband and I ordered the  large flank steak  the small lamb chops and a side of mushrooms to share   The flank steak was mediocre  I prefer my husbands over theirs  The flank steak could have been more flavorful   The side salad and the mushrooms were good but there was nothing outstanding about the sides   The side salad and mushrooms tasted like any other restaurant   My husband liked the lamb chops  But said they were average tasting   The portion size is small  My husband could have easily ate all of the food himself  I was hoping for a really different tasting  flavorful meal but everything we had was average tasting  With that said I would be willing to go back and maybe try one of the sandwiches on the menu   I think we just maybe did not order the right thing  But the atmosphere is fun and hip and the BYOB would be a good addition if you had to wait in a really long line    stars,3,2017-03-31
Gaucho   Who doesn t love to say Gaucho   And what meat eaters wouldn t love this tiny little spot in the Strip   We arrived early on a Saturday morning   And Chef Anthony Falcon was already performing for the crowd   Yes  this man is a performer  describing the menu  giving tips on what to order and truly thrilling the crowd   So  here is a bit of the condensed version of the story of this grill spot   A gaucho is an Argentina cowboy   These gauchos would grill beef over a wood fire  giving the meat an incredible flavor   Chef Anthony s great grandfather was a gaucho in Argentina   Be sure to search the restaurant wall for a photo of him dressed in gaucho garb   Well  on to the story   Chef Anthony s uncle visited Pittsburgh from Argentina and said  you have got to put a restaurant in the Strip   And so  here we are today     It s interesting to enter and see stacks of natural hardwood everywhere   All cooking it done by fire   No oven   No stove   And definitely no microwave   It s almost prehistoric   Wood  fire  meat   The day we visited  Chef Anthony was not cooking  he was entertaining and waiting on the crowd   Not being super hungry  we opted to order simple items   I got a cob of corn and steak empanadas   OMG   Can t say enough about the awesome flavors here   BJ got a chorizo sandwich with peppers  onion   pimenton   So good   Also  I added the pimenton to my empanadas   Spectacular     Clearly  we need to return with an appetite   And try more of the menu   Can t wait for that ,4,2014-01-01
our best meal during our stay in pittsburgh   the carne sandwich was fantastic   the sauces were exquisite   you may as well make a few orders of tostados  toast  simply to enjoy the sauces   the empanadas were really good  and my wife enjoyed her heirloom tomato salad   her only regret   not getting steak on it   logistics are a bit tricky   it s fast casual in the sense that you wait in line  usually a long time   order  and pay   but then the staff seats you  and you re welcome to stay as long as you want   nobody rushes you  even though there is a long line   there are obvious ways that the restaurant could increase their bottom line  more tables closer together  working more quickly  etc   but it s quite charming as is   highly recommended   and  yes  i ll wait in line next time  too ,5,2016-11-24
The staff are super upbeat  fun and very welcoming    Everything that we ordered was very delicious   It really made waiting in line worth it   I ve been to a lot of restaurants  I m from Chicago  but never to one that made a      positive impression in all points   I only wish they had one in Chicago or northern Illinois ,5,2016-07-18
The concept of this small corner restaurant is so peculiar to me  You order in advance from a huge selection  that serves to any palate and diet  and then  proceed to be seated and wait for a staff member come into the room  call out your name  and deliver your meal    Even though the place can get crowded  the atmosphere is tranquil  modern  and enjoyable   The food was extremely good  I had the Arracera  hanger steak  served with La Casa salad  house salad  and substituted the ciabatta bread it offers for a side of avocado  at no expense   The meat was cooked to perfection  with a rich flavorful grilled taste  The house salsas  sauces  are a must have item to try when you go visit this adorable restaurant    The staff is friendly  the interior is clean  and the food is amazing  I don t think there is more I could right to not want to make you go eat here    Definitely will come back during my next visit to Pittsburgh,5,2018-03-21
Gaucho never disappoints  The steak is obviously fantastic but a hidden gem on the menu is the grilled camerones  Perfection every time,5,2016-05-13
The best meals in the strip district  Their meats were so well seasoned and cooked to perfection  You even get to pick from four different sauces  I enjoyed all of them   There s always a long line so I would suggest going on an off time to not have to wait outside  We had a few people looking at our meals and asked us what we order  Here s what to get   Argentina small salad      and add steak      for the best of it all   I got a beef empanadas      added too and it was delicious   Sixteen dollars for an amazing meal    I would say I m confused on the set up of ordering first at the counter and then they seat you  You don t see staff often for refills so I wasn t sure if this was a wait staff or just workers dropping off our food ,4,2017-08-20
The food was on point  Big fan of the Brussel sprouts  empanadas   yams  Great addition to the strip district,5,2015-12-28
Absolutely love   Very friendly staff and great food ,5,2016-02-28
Really good for the meat eater  I loved the salsas especially   I ll definitely be back ,5,2015-12-29
I was blown away by the entire early dinner experience Husband and I had here last night   Always nice when expectations and hype are met   Allow me to add to Gaucho Parrilla Argentina s accolades     We ordered the Asado Plate  which is a grilled heap of all   of Gaucho s available cuts of beef   Our decision to order this dish was a fantastic one   Sure  I ve experienced each of these meats before  but it was really cool to have all the grilled meats labeled side by side and compare them visually as well as by taste   A nice surprise was that the portion was bigger than I expected   I anticipated I d love the filet  which I did  and was surprised by how delicious the skirt was  a nice amount of fat and very tender   The other cuts  NY  flank  and ribeye  were all nicely executed and good  but the filet and skirt stood out to me   Also ordered the large portion of Vegetales  which is essentially a beautiful plate of mixed grilled veggies   I thought some of the vegetables tasted kind of plain  but then something dawned on me   Read on   Gaucho s condiments are what really take this place to the next level   The   complimentary condiments  chimmi churri  pimenton  ajo  and cebolla  can be dished up fresh from jars in the ordering area  or you can purchase  oz  for      The condiments are killer and really give the already yummy food some oomph  and I liked that none of the condiments are spicy   Pimenton was my favorite  followed closely by cebolla   The ajo was a little salty for me but still delicious  and the chimmi churri  though flavorful and tangy like chimmi churri usually is  was surprisingly thin   This place rocks   I love everything about it   Every aspect of our dinner  quality of food  portion size  d cor  price point  was right on and beyond reproach   Service was extremely friendly  efficient  and knowledgeable   Hell  even the weather was perfect for eating outside on the little patio facing Penn Avenue   A very  very easy   stars ,5,2014-05-09
You don t need to read any of these reviews   This is the most popular spot in the city  and Yelp s    in the country     Just make sure you try the sauces   The garlic  ajo   one made my meal completely   This place doesn t need me to tell you to go there  but if you need a review still  a messy one follows   The    and I have tried to come here a couple times in the last year   The first time  after work last winter  called the place  they said they were almost closing         so don t bother  Fine   Tried to go a few weeks ago while in the Strip on a Saturday  HA   Unless you are patient and are extremely weather prepared  don t bother   Lines out the door  we waited for about fifteen minutes and decided waiting in line outside in January is not for us   But alas  I had a half day of work due to an appointment in Bloomfield   It was   PM  snowing like crazy  maybe four degrees out  and you re damn right I got on that    bus and slid down to the Strip District   The inside is tiiiiiny  Mostly kitchen  a middle table  six stools along the sides of the wall   I was immediately greeted by Anthony  I think  who was so unbelievably awesome   Another cook there  younger kid  was drinking all the wine in this BYOB establishment so I knew I liked this place already   I wanted to take dinner home as the    was stuck in meetings all afternoon and couldn t join me  so I needed things that traveled well   I knew I wanted chicken  pollo     which is  poh jo  ish  not  po yo   this ain t a Mexican joint   and was directed to the sandwich which he suggested I get  deconstructed    toast instead of bread  everything piled together  oh my sweet jeebus  you don t even know   It had mushrooms on it which I do not do   but I ate them  Me  Picky Queen of the East  I also got the potatoes  papas   which were roasted to almost a blackened state in the best sense   Don t forget the sauces for these   I had a lot of help packing everything into my huge brown bag   Everything separate and packaged so nicely  They are too sweet here  I can t stress that enough   I asked for the most popular items for      He received a rosemary beef sandwich and corn   After he put that thing together and drenched it in the horseradish sauce  it was gone   I have no idea what happened   I thought he was going to drink the chimichurri  I m not a beef eater  but it honestly smelled good enough to potentially turn me against my moral judgments   The food is some of the best South American y business I have ever had   It might even be worth the line outside in January or  at the very least  another half day of work ,5,2015-02-20
I could eat at this place every day and bathe in the Chimichurri sauce   Nuff said ,5,2018-01-04
Excellent food and service  I got Pescado and it was great  We had to wait for   hour standing before we got seats  ,5,2016-08-28
Terrific meal     Great location and atmosphere   But food is outstanding ,5,2016-02-02
This is my repeat visit to this meat haven  granted it s been years since my first visit  I think I ve gathered enough information to develop a conclusion  I am not nearly the carnivore I think I am    Seeing how Gaucho is quite possibly top three restaurant in terms of Yelp popularity in Pittsburgh  I think it should be held to a higher standard  So here comes the truth   Good  The energy is undeniable and the wait staff is pleasant  beyond helpful    This space is vast despite its deceiving outer appearance   the smaller items on menu are exceptional  Take the whole  smaller  term with a grain of salt though  I m not sure these guys know small      The not so good  although the meat is plentiful  this isn t exactly Texas low n slow style  Tenderness matters  especially when it s this much packed in a sandwich    Personally I feel where they excel is the sides and appetizers  Items like the empanadas or the roasted cauliflower are great  The cauliflower honestly is out of this world good    Gaucho remains a formidable lunch option  with great value for your dollar  Just don t expect to have additional stomach space for dinner    ,4,2017-12-09
Ordered the steak burger with Caramelized onions and mushrooms  Sandwich was huge  Could feed    Anthony is awesome  friendly and upbeat staff ,5,2015-01-21
Totally insane  an amazing experience  I think the rest of the reviews on here confirm the meal that I enjoyed,5,2015-10-26
Hmm  after having read so many reviews I probably had very high expectations   I am not saying the food wasn t good but probably not as much as I read about it  Or it could probably be that I didn t order their signature Rosemary steak   I ordered Pollo  chicken  sandwich and it was very average   The red sauce was good but one of the sauce was terrible   I really loved the cookie and infact bought a few more to go as well  Will try their steak next time to be fair    But for whatever I ate today I will give only    ,4,2016-01-20
Top five sandwiches I ve had anywhere in the world  Chicken or beef  Doesn t matter everything is awesome ,5,2014-08-14
The food here is phenomenal  Be prepared for a bit of a wait and close quarters   they expanded recently but there still isn t a ton of seating  and when we went  there was a line out the door  However  the staff is incredibly friendly  and my Bondiola  roasted pork shoulder  sandwich was well worth the wait  Also  it s a BYOB  which is great  We will definitely be back ,4,2015-08-24
This go around  I was a bit hungrier so I ordered the steak burger       medium well with candied bacon and Spanish blue cheese as my freebie toppings  additional toppings are    cents ea    The burger was served neatly between two thick slices of bread  not sure of the type   In addition to the burger  I also ordered a side of their brussel sprouts and rice  A plentiful amount of sprouts are served with candied bacon  They re quite tasty  but I m not sure I d give them the award for best sprouts in the city  The rice was quite bland and flavorless  The majority of the rice was soft  but some pieces were crunchy and ultimately got stuck in my teeth   unsure if that s the way the rice is meant to be served  Brought my own wine and wasn t charged a corkage fee  unsure if they even charge one     Sat in the back of the restaurant  What should be a     experience became a       due to a number of fruit flies swarming around the table  Originally sat in the back right corner  but moved a bit closer to the center of the room in an effort to avoid them   unfortunately  this didn t help as they just followed my trail  By the time we finished up  we had caught two flies in a wine glass  I mentioned something to one of the employees who seemed shocked and noted that she had been at the restaurant since   A and hadn t seen any  strange    Anyway  she said she d mention something to one of the managers    The place started to get busy closer to      and I could tell we were subtly being pushed out the door when two employees started cleaning everything off the table  We got the hint and left ,3,2015-10-16
This place was amazing  I ordered the steak sandwich and selected the skirt steak  There are many cuts of beef to choose from for this sandwich including flank  skirt  NY strip and filet mignon  I asked the cashier for his recommendation and he suggested the skirt steak so that s what I went with  The sandwich was amazing and the steak very flavorful  I would recommend this place to anyone  My boyfriend got the sandwich with flank steak  It was good but the skirt is the way to go  The added fat in that cut of meat elevates the taste  This is a MUST try in Pittsburgh ,5,2013-12-15
Never have been disappointed here  You can smell it a block away and that only makes you want it more    Everything from the steak to chicken to fish is all incredible    Staff is beyond friendly and down to earth  They get they re a small place and they make people feel appreciated and welcomed even with a line out the door    Can t wait for their expansion   Ps  secret patio seating on the side and its BYOB  Just hard to find a seat ,5,2014-11-17
No matter what you choose off the menu  you ll most likely eat the best sandwich you ve ever had in your life ,5,2015-10-02
I had the steak burger and it was very good  Nice size lunch portion  Little pricey  but worth it  Nice people working there  Go and enjoy ,4,2016-01-06
To be completely honest I thought there was no way Gaucho would live up to my expectations  I have yet to hear a bad thing about the place and maybe I m a pessimist    but I didn t believe anything could be that perfect   I drove nearly   hours non stop from North East Pennsylvania    landed in the Strip District and immediately walked up the street to Gaucho Parrilla  I ordered the steak burger with onions and peppers  It was large  it was mouthwatering good  and although I was completely full and satisfied  I had to debate with myself on why I shouldn t order a second one to scarf down   Gaucho is perfection  I can t imagine why anyone would go anywhere else  From the friendly staff  to the most delicious steak I ve ever tasted  to the interior and layout  Everything is perfect  The   star rating isn t a fluke    it s that good ,5,2015-11-09
Tasty spot with a variety of great looking options   The sauces were all excellent  and the mixed grill platter was good   sausage  chicken and steak all flavorful and well cooked  although mine came out a little on the cold side  which was kind of a disappointment   Empanadas were pretty good as well  although they did not blow me away   Overall  I would like to try some other items on the menu  and I enjoyed the things I did have  although my major complaint would be that it is a tad overpriced   Not terribly expensive mind you  but just a bid overpriced for what you get   Would I return   Yes ,4,2017-01-22
Came across an old picture of the amazing food from this place  so I figured I d write up a quick  and long overdue  review   We ordered the Cerdo  Pork  and Camarones  Shrimp  extra special plates as well as side orders of Pork Empanadas and Gaucho Papas  The Cerdo plate was comprised of pork tenderloin  caramelized onion  spicy mustard  small salad  and toast   The pork tenderloin tasted amazing atop the toast with the onions and spicy mustard sauce mixed in  I m more of a carnivore  so I left the salad for my girlfriend  The Camarones were also really good   simple and clean   The potatoes were nothing special on their own  but fortunately there were   really yummy sauces to dip into  Chimmi  Ajo  Pimenton  and Cebolla  We were both obsessed with the Ajo  which I think means garlic   The Empanadas were probably the least remarkable thing we ate  although they weren t bad by any stretch   Another really cool feature of this place is the BYOB policy  It was our first time here  so we were woefully unprepared  but we saw plenty of patrons taking advantage ,4,2016-04-06
Let me start by saying that I am Argentine   I recently moved to Pittsburgh and I was VERY hesitant to eat here   I was pleasantly surprised   The Chorizo is not authentic Argentine Chorizo  but the Chimichuri  and the steak sandwich was phenomenal   The service was great and the menu was quite impressive considering the size of the restaurant   I will be back for sure ,4,2014-07-17
The food is phenomenal here  Ate outside because we had an oddly warm February day this year  The line is a bit annoying  however the food is worth it  Every employee I encountered was wonderful and I look forward to going back sometime soon    Suggestions  Write your order out in your notes before you get the register so you don t forget anything  Steak filet con pan was an awesome experience and the Brussels are next level  Don t forget the empanadas ,5,2016-02-28
WHAT IS LIFE    This was so good    I ve had wood grilled meat when I was younger  and this place knocked me off my feet  All meats are amazing here  Loved my chanchito in a sandwich  We also got the New York steak which was perfectly medium rare and mouth watering  So good  I can t say much about the veggies because we pretty much just ate lots of meat  Mmmhhh meeaaat    Only down side to this place is that it s very small  I would suggest getting things to go  but if you want a homey experience  dine in  Just don t go with more than   people  I think they have   chairs total  P The owners are amazingly kind though  so they don t mind people squeezing in    Final tip  go before  pm    They close at  pm and I swear everyone and their mom goes between    pm  it s so funny  Not sure why this is the case  but we beat the crowd because we re pros  Be a pro  you ll get your food faster    ,5,2015-02-23
The food here   wow  If you don t like this something is wrong with your taste buds  the food is excellent and I mean everything on the menu  we had a party of   and we ate a lot of food but it was all amazing  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food   ,5,2018-06-30
There s not much I can say that hasn t been said  but I ve been a Gaucho fan for a long time  A couple years ago I was walking through the Strip and smelled something delicious  I followed my nose and found Gaucho  I like to think I discovered it before it got big   I ve been at least   times since then and have told all of my friends  co workers  family  and out of town guests    The corn on the cob is simple and tasty  I usually get a steak sandwich and load it up with some of their fresh made sauces  chimichurri is great   The papas  shrimp  and salads are all good too    As Gaucho has gotten more popular  the lines have been out of control  even after they expanded  The last   times I ve tried to go to Gaucho  I ve turned around and gone elsewhere due to the line  I hope they can figure out a way to expedite food a bit faster while maintaining quality   for their sake and ours ,5,2016-06-25
Well  I suppose I m going to be the voice of dissent here  but I was Not Impressed with this place  Being of partial Latin American descent  Guatemalan  but Mom spent part of her childhood in Buenos Aires   I am no stranger to grilled meats in this style  to chimichurri  to elotes  this is the food of the summers of my childhood  However  that food my father would so lovingly slave over the grill preparing for us differed from what I experienced at Gaucho in two ways  it was cooked properly  and even more importantly  IT WAS SEASONED  My daughter and I hit up Gaucho on a Thursday afternoon for lunch  I had heard great things  and it smelled wonderful  so we were super excited  On a recommendation from a friend  we ordered the Matambre  flank steak   Gaucho Papas  roasted potatoes   and the Gaucho Salad  With a drink and tip this came to about      NOT a cheap lunch  but you pay for good food  right  The wait for the food was long  but we thought it d be worth it  and their patio is really very pleasant  Oh  and we loaded up on condiments  including chimichurri  an herb garlic vinaigrette that is essential to any Latin steak meal  and some cebolla  a similar combo but with caramelized onions instead of herbs   So  the food finally came and upon the first glance I noticed that the flank steak was cut VERY sloppily  with connective tissue visible throughout  Secondly  the inside of the cuts were so rare that they were practically blue and still mooing  Listen  I yell at people who order even MEDIUM done steak  This was beyond rare  So rare and connective y that most of it was hard to chew  And to add insult to injury  it lacked any seasoning  Nothing  So  I tried the chimi and the cebolla  Equally bland  I mean  like  no damned seasoning at all  I never reach for a salt shaker  but boy  I was looking for one to attempt to make these expensive strips of tough tartare edible  It was shocking how tasteless everything was  but I especially was floored about the chimichurri  Chimi should be a veritable palate explosion of fresh parsley  garlic  vinegar and citrus  This was not    that  Absolutely awful  The potatoes were seasoned  and hot  We liked those  The salad was not a    salad  Unseasoned  with just a few drops of balsamic vinegar  and some very brown and sad avocado slices  Also bad  Perhaps we didn t order the right things  perhaps it was an off day  but as a Latina  I am absolutely astonished at the widespread love this place gets  Pittsburgh seems to never get Latin American food right  with an exception for the tacos at Las Palmas   and it is a damned shame that a place as mediocre  or even poor  as Gaucho has people jumping for joy  If only you folks knew how good this food really can be  I wish I could have you all over for the real deal ,2,2014-06-21

I hate to be a Debbie Downer with this review  but I believe in being honest and not feeding into the hype because it s trending  I don t really understand the    rating for this place    I ll begin by saying the food is actually pretty good  It is certainly not the best we have ever had  but it was decent if you are a meat lover  They offer a variety of options located on the chalk board at the entrance of the restaurant  No menus   At least we were never offered any  Don t worry  you will have PLENTY of time to look at it as you will likely stand in line for a LONG time waiting to place your order at the counter   More on that to come   We  the party of    ordered the following   Mixed Grill which consisted of a presentable offering of chorizo sausage  chicken and sirloin  No sides  The sausage was the best  the chicken was very juicy and tender  the steak was just ok  but a bit chewy   Ribeye grill which included a small salad on the plate which was tasty  The ribeye was pretty good too    Since there are no real sides offered with either meal  we selected the corn pudding to share  It was also prepared well  but I thought could have used a bit more seasoning   We ordered water with lemon   Overall  the food was tasty  but the next segment of this review is what left a bad taste in my mouth    Wah   Wah    enter Debbie Downer   Here is where I take issue with this place  There is a complete lack of structure for their patrons to place orders and be seated  We spent more time in line waiting to get in the place than actually consuming our meal  It is set up like waiting at an extremely busy high priced fast food joint with better quality food  Hey  if you are into these trendy BYOB places and don t mind spending more time in line while you watch empty tables calling your name while you stand in line forever  go for it   Seriously  when we were finally seated  we watched several tables that were never occupied whilie dozens of folks continued to stand in line to order and wrap around the sidewalk outside  In my opinion  the message here is that the CUSTOMER s time is clearly the last thing on their mind  I will certainly keep that in my mind if and when we would ever consider going here again  Sadly  I doubt we will   I enjoy good food  but not at the expense of my time waiting in a long line and inflated prices  Just my   cents  or in this case     for dinner and no drinks  only water  I would give the food an    but the long and nonsensical system to be seated gets a    Sadly  I would give this place a final overall rating   just because of how frustrating the ordering process is set up  However  to end on a positive note  the servers were all friendly and laid back  But as I stated  I doubt we would go back   Wah   Wah ,2,2016-08-28
Lives up to all the hype  Best sandwich I have ever had in my entire life  Just go there ,5,2015-02-23
If you like meat  you must try Gaucho   Wonderful flavors ,5,2016-05-02
Superb   Just not much to say  except be prepared to wait in line  for a bit   But seriously worth it ,5,2016-09-14
I work just a few doors down from this place   whenever it s open it s ALWAYS packed  I believe I ve even seen the line go out the door upon a few occasions   So yea   the place is VERY good   The menu pretty much has anything you can think of from chicken  beef  pork    fresh fish prepared in a multitude of ways      they even will do special request orders if you don t see exactly what you want on their menu   WHAT          Some downers  LLLOOOOONNNNGGGG line to order   to get your food  Very tightly spaced place inside   a lil more open in their tiny patio but not by much    so be ready to get your food to go   go   Some helpful pointers  CALL in advance to place your order  especially if to go    you get I think a     off   so that s really nice  HOWEVER  because they are SO busy   don t expect them to answer right away    you may have to leave a message to get a call back or keep trying til you get thru    so yea   did I mention they re busy       In all in all   it s worth it    the food is excellent   I enjoy it immensely ,5,2014-05-08
This is the kind of food that makes you happy  It is that good  I had the Carne Sandwich with ribeye steak  caramelize onions and grill pepper with chimichurri sauce and let me tell you that it was amazing  I ordered by phone because usually the line in this place are very long   Now I know why  The smell in this place makes you hungry  The employees are very friendly  I can t wait to go back and try other stuff in the menu  Excellent food ,5,2016-11-10
I m a big fan of the pescado  that s fish  sandwich  Make sure to drench it liberally with whichever salsa you prefer from the salsa bar  and you won t be disappointed  Note that it can get pretty busy here around lunchtime  especially on nice summer days   so consider coming on the early side if you don t want to wait in line forever   I only have one minor complaint with the establishment    parts of the bread sometimes come out pretty burnt  and burnt food is a suspected carcinogen   But  you have to balance that with the deliciousness  so I figure it s worth it once in a while ,4,2017-02-03
Delicious  Totally loved the potatoes  we got there as soon as it opened so no wait  We got empanadas and they were super flavorful  especially with all of the great sauces they offer  We each got sandwiches  one carne filet medium rare and one braised beef  and they were both great  That bread is to die for    Staff was incredibly nice and helpful  Overall wonderful lunch,5,2015-11-25
ALWAYS delicious   I had a friend in from out of town this weekend and took him here   he is still talking about it days later   Some of the best food in the city   by far ,5,2017-02-15
Hi  the food is excellent here  but service is horrible  We ordered to go and the cashier said it is courteous to tip on to go orders  Since I m ballin  I dropped a      Then  when I ate the to go order in their outdoor patio  which smelled like trash  they had the audacity to say that I was not welcomed since it was a to go order  There was plenty of open seating ,2,2018-07-26
I HATE waiting for anything  Here  I stood out in line in the blistering sun  Then waited more at my table  And WOW was it worth it  The steak is spectacular  Everything is so well executed  Highly recommended ,5,2017-08-19
Amazing place with really polite and cheerful staff   Great vegetarian options  Vegetable sandwich and empanadas are highly recommended   PS  though the line might be huge  its worth the wait    ,5,2017-06-17
I ve always heard about people talking about gaucho  but never actually tried it until my third year in college  Each time I came I knew exactly what to expect  and gaucho never fails to deliver  The only downside is that the wait can be pretty long during primary dinner hours       pm and after   so if you go around      or earlier the wait time can be significantly reduced    The main thing that I typically order is the Carne De Vaca  which is a meat platter consisting of a cut of meat of your choice  sirloin  flank  etc    a side of salad  and bread  A few times  I have gotten two cuts of meat to split with my friend  one order of a large and another order of the small  This allows us to get a portion of meat in between a large and a small  and two cuts to try    I have also gotten the Carne  which is a sandwich based on a meat of your choice  This has really good peppers that complement the meat well  but to me I personally prefer the platters because they are more filing and have more meat overall   The last time I went  I shared the Asado plate with one other person  which gives you all five cuts of meat     oz total   It was a lot of meat and more pricey  but also very tasty and filling  In my opinion  though some cuts were more tender than others  I didn t think the difference was big enough for me to change my typical order of one of the cheaper meats in the platter   Overall a great experience and a must try for all those who visit or live in Pittsburgh ,5,2017-05-18
Simply outstanding food  I m now going to out myself as one of those avid Yelp users who has relied on Yelp     times  literally   all throughout the country  and recommends the app to everyone     and yet I ve never written a review  Today  I was inspired to do so by a phenomenal meal at Gaucho Parrilla Argentina   I can t remember previously seeing a full   star review on Yelp with     reviews  This restaurant deserves that status  My son and I had two steak sandwiches  one ribeye  one NY Strip  and both were absolutely delicious    perfect bread  excellent steak  killer sauces  and a just right balance of onion  pepper  and seasoning  Really  hard to make a sandwich much better  Sides were also absolutely top notch   shrimp  corn  and papas  Each were legitimately world class  If it sounds like I m exaggerating  I m not  My wife is a classically trained French chef and we re fortunate enough to have really high quality food pretty much every day  We ve eaten at terrific restaurants all over the country  and beyond    This place merits a five star review    I ll also say that from a service perspective  every person we interacted with there was kind  knowledgeable  and willing to talk about the history behind the place   They went above and beyond    A few caveats  just to manage expectations  First  BYOB  No corkage fee  but no alcohol there  Also  the place is charming but teeny    it probably seats less than eight people on counters and stools  If anything  this is more of a takeout place  definitely not white table cloth  Effectively  we re talking     on food  albeit with a limited menu  but a    on decor  Finally  be aware that Gaucho Parrilla Argentina closes at   PM and is closed on Sunday and Monday    So  if you understand the limitations of the place beforehand  make sure you come  You ll walk out saying that it was some of the best food you ve ever eaten  While I m from Pittsburgh originally  I live in Boston and in town for the Steeler game  I ll certainly be back at Gaucho the next time I m in the Burgh  A classic Yelp gem ,5,2013-10-20
Oh I looooove Gaucho   I remember when they were half the size  prior to the remodel  I didn t even mind the wait for a table  When I go  I love the Carne   It s my favorite   Parking is a bit of a challenge  but it is really worth it ,5,2016-05-21
One of my favorite spots in the city   The whole experience is handled with enthusiasm and confidence   And why not   When you re putting out marinated love you should be proud   Now if they only delivered ,5,2016-02-14
Who said you can t get a little bit Argentina in Pittsburgh  If madonna stopped in to this spot she be singing oh Argentina all over again  All I can say is no matter what you eat here you are going to be blown away the steak sandwiches melting your mouth as do just about everything else I ve tried  went on the strip get you a strip a steak at the Argentine ,5,2015-09-17
Not much to say that hasn t already been said here   Outstanding food  great service  fun atmosphere   Prices are a little steep but the amount of flavor packed in each meal is well worth it   Awesome little joint ,5,2014-03-18
Came for a late lunch and only a small line  They have a huge menu with so many choices  but settled on a medium rare ribeye sandwich  well prepared  but a little chewy   Also ordered empanadas  chicken  pork  and veggie  and they were all excellent  The different sauces were also very good  but my favorites were the red pepper and sweet onion  Would come back to try something different when in Pittsburgh ,4,2016-07-18
This place is absolutely amazing and worth it s    national yelp spot  Came on a Saturday so there was a bit of a wait  surprisingly only about    minutes total though which is unexpected   They have their menu up on a chalkboard when you come in and a few people pop in and out from behind the bar in order to make sure that you understand or can assist you with the menu  Be prepared to eat bread covered in delicious meat  The steak is absolutely phenomenal  I opted for the con carne sandwich on ciabatta with the arrechera  flank steak  meat  which isn t even the lomo filet  and I was amazed  It s also covered in Chimi and caramelized onions  which I adore  I had a side of a chicken empanada  which wasn t my favorite  but for those who wants a tad of spiciness in their selection  a good option to have    KB has destined for a bread binge  Each portion of Tostados are   large supple pieces of toast grilled in olive oil just waiting for that great opportunity to be dunked in one of gaucho s   ridiculously well crafted dipping sauces  We overzealously ordered   orders of Tostados  That s a lot of bread and a lot of dipping sauce  But SO worth it  In general  this WHOLE PLACE is SO worth it   The only downside to this place is that my picutre of my meal did not get more likes on Instagram  but i think that may be outside gaucho s control  Loving it  Gaucho  you make Pittsburgh proud ,5,2015-08-09
I go here with my gf and when the food comes  we literally do not speak to each other until the food is all gone ,5,2016-04-01
Excellent AUTHENTIC cuisine    Their homemade sauces are amazing ,5,2015-09-30
This is the best steak sandwich I have ever had  We go here almost every Saturday  Their sauces are quire exquisite as well    There is very limited seating inside  and a bit of a wait  but it s so worth it  ,5,2013-11-25
The Gaucho is one of those special spots where taste and value are synchronized  The mixed grill with smoky sausage  chicken  and steak was oh so good and cooked to perfection         Even with my own delicious good in front of me  I couldn t help creep on our neighbors fatty    dollar sandwiches  It could easily find myself eating his multiple times a week after a good workout and not have my wallet empty  What more could you ask for  ,5,2015-07-25
Solid place  a must if you re in the Strip   Got quick service on a Saturday night   uber friendly staff  good atmosphere  They were out of bread  like  all bread   the pork  fish  and steak empanadas  Instead  the server suggested ordering the papas and getting the sandwich filling over the potatoes  I asked if we could do that for the sandwich price  but he said no  Seems goofy  bread is clearly an important part of a sandwich  a starchy substitute should be gratis  fellas  Still  the dish was fine for the extra few bucks  and the papas were delicious  The rosemary beef was very tasty  but oh MAN was it salty  I m a big savory fan  but the beef was overseasoned  Veggie empanadas were not the soft  flaky pastry others have described  but were tough and barely warm  Nothing we were served was hot  which I wasn t a fan of    Got the last package of lemon alfajores  which were BANGIN   SO GOOD     Definitely going to come back earlier in the week and give this place another go  I ll be happy to change this review with a great next visit ,3,2015-03-08
Now physically expanded  Same quality  now more seating  This place continues to do it correctly ,5,2016-07-20
Was surprised by the extremely high rating in Yelp for this spot  but I love steak and went in hoping for the best  This place didn t disappoint  Food was incredible and so delish   For my first time  they recommended the steak sandwich which I got with a rib eye cut  you can choose the cut of steak for your sandwich   which was cool in and of itself   Steak sandwich was topped with sweet caramelized onions and roasted peppers which were packed with flavor  The location was really cool and trendy with Snoop Dogg and Easy E playing in the background  Staff was genuinely friendly and helpful  Definitely will be back ,5,2015-08-11
Outdoor seating has been reopened  Best time to come is late afternoon though because who doesn t want to enjoy the outdoors on the  Burgh  Really appreciate the table aide service  even though we are outdoors  And as always the food was delicious ,5,2015-07-08
Love this place  Unique but amazing food with a cool atmosphere  Just be aware they don t take reservations and the line on weekends can take hours  Great price for what you get ,5,2017-06-22
Wow  this place was amazing  The line was really long  if you ve ever driven past it usually is  but the food comes out very quick  The food was so delicious  We got the Picado that had meats  cheeses  fruits  and almonds  I got the Cerdo and my aunt got the Ribeye  they were both amazing  The carmelized onions  onyinz  were phenomenal  the toast was great  the salad was good  I can t think of one bad thing to say  The service was great as well  SOOOOOOOO worth the wait ,5,2017-08-12
My friends brought me here to try Argentinian food  I was EXTREMELY disappointed because I ordered steak medium cooked and it had little to no seasoning  I don t recommend ordering steak from this place  Order something else like their sandwiches  Also  there s no seasoning on the table so you eat what they serve you  You pay ahead as well even if you don t like your food  So they rob you if you aren t satisfied with your order  I don t agree with this business model whatsoever especially since you are required to tip ahead of time even without being served first  Who does that   ,2,2018-05-13
Soooo good  Lots of flavor   I would definitely recommend the empanadas  Try with all the dipping sauces  The corn on the cob was grilled and excellent compliment to the fish sandwich I had  I love this place ,5,2017-07-13
Amazing  I could smell the place   blocks away  I m assume that this is what heaven will smell like   The line way a bit long but the anticipation of the food made it tolerable  An emploee explained the different sandwiches to me and even convinced me to get the carmelized onions  i had informed her that i don t like onions   I ordered   sandwiches to go  steak burger w arrugula   provolone cheese  pork w  carmelized onions   spicey mustard   rosemary braised beef w  carmelized onions   The steak burger   pork were incredible   The pork sandwich was maybe the best sandwich I ve ever had   Can t wait to try the rosemary beef later ,5,2015-08-12
Nothing can go wrong with wood fired grilling   Gaucho is the best  and the only one  place where you can try the perfect Argentine style grills in Pittsburgh  They grills almost everything  red meat  chicken  shrimps  veggies  you can tell  how their magical ingredient  the wood smoke can make greater   My favorites are wood smoked shrimps and veggie plate   They also have nice paella  available in big portion only   sea food soup  recommend    and pierogies   The meat quality  cut  part of meat  varies a lot depend on the portion size and or the day ,5,2016-10-10
There s always a line  but they deserve it  I stopped eating beef when I moved to Pittsburgh from the Midwest  Tried my husband s filet sandwich on our first visit  and it s now on my regular rotation of places to go and things to eat while working in the Strip District  Very tasty  high quality food  Grilled veggies are also fabulous  Try to get there when they open for lunch to beat the line ,5,2016-02-05
I pray to God that the owner sees this review  because I had briefly spoken with him once before and he seemed like a very genuine guy who cares about his business  So  here we go   I must preface this review by stating the following  I enjoy the food from this place moreso than any restaurant in Pittsburgh  It really is delicious  Unfortunately this is the absolute worst managed restaurant I have ever been to or seen  If not for the unbelievable food I would never come here  The line during the busy hours in unbearable  I can understand and even apprecuate a place that has a line because the product dictates higher demand  That is not the entire cause of the problem here  Yes  thenfood is fantastic and yes that makes them busy  but these people have no interest whatsoever in helping alleviate the problem  There is only ever   register open with   person taking orders  ONE  Meanwhile there is a second register sitting right there that no one uses while   guy stands there and does nothing but offer u a glass of water while you lose your mind  another older guy sits on his ass at the end of the counter doing nothing  and guy number   who im assuming is the worlds worst restaurant manager concerns himself only with the shape of the que that has formed and whether or not the door is closed  OPEN THE SECOND REGISTER YOU WORTHLESS FOOL  I cannot get over how much i love the food here  but by the time i get to order I am so completely disgusted and frustrated after having watched these clowns do nothing for    minutes that I wish I could bring myself to stop eating here simply out of spite  I have never been so overcome by anger and frustration at any restaurant before and it happens EVERY SINGLE TIME i come here  Anthony  please  Hire a good manager  I know a few great people with plenty of experience  Lose the clowns and get some help  Your cooking deserves better from your staff ,2,2016-08-10
Despite being a non beef eater  Gaucho has been on my radar for ages  and I finally made it in tonight   Ironically  I wasn t planning to come here  I was actually planning to go to a Mexican place in Lawrenceville   However  a bike path closure forced me to detour onto Smallman St   and I soon found myself in the heart of the Strip District at the corner of   st   A quick glance at my nearby bookmarked restaurants at     pm indicated that most of them were closed  but that Gaucho was open for another half hour   I realized this was my golden opportunity to try it  so after riding down a sketchy alleyway and parking my bike  in I walked   If this wasn t serendipity  I don t know what is   As I suspected  it wasn t busy  given how close it was to closing time   Upon being greeted by a guy by the register  I mentioned that this was my first time visiting  and he explained that there isn t table service  but that I could order off the chalkboard menu   I mentioned that I knew they were known for their steak sandwich  but that I didn t eat beef  and he explained how the turkey and chicken sandwiches differed   Based on his description  I decided to try the chicken  pollo  sandwich with some grilled corn on the cob  maiz    He mentioned that they were out of caramelized onions  but that he could put something else on instead  such as asparagus   I love asparagus  so I told him that sounded like a great idea   My order took about    min  to come up    As I was waiting  I overheard the guy who d waited on me speak to some customers seated at the counter   He told them how he started working there and became the manager  and how some of the menu offerings were developed   He also mentioned that he liked everything on the menu   It was clear that he has a great sense of pride in the business   When my order came up  I took it outdoors to the small patio adjoining the restaurant to eat  after getting some water  utensils  and all of the sauces   After taking the obligatory photos  I tucked in   It was delicious   The meat on the sandwich was so tender  it melted in my mouth  and the asparagus and mushrooms were perfectly grilled   The bread was fresh  chewy  and substantial   Although the sandwich came with some ajo  garlic  sauce on it  I added some more  as well as some of the red pepper sauce and the cebolla  onion  sauce   The corn made for a great accompaniment to the sandwich  esp  with all of the sauces drizzled on it   The employees were even kind enough to give me two ears instead of the normal one  either because they were small or due to it being near the end of serving hours   Aside from making occasional small noises  mmm  etc    I m pretty sure I didn t come up for air when eating   Given that they were deep in conversation for most of the time I was eating  I don t know if the couple seated on the patio noticed me  but if they did  they probably nicknamed me something like  Hungry  due to my rabid and shifty eyed devouring of the food   Indeed  that food was so good  I m glad I came alone so I didn t have to be embarrassed about my ravenousness or making a mess with the sauces   You know the food s great when you don t want any distractions ,5,2014-10-11
Amazing food  cute space  and efficient even when they are super busy and have a long line  This place is an absolute must in Pittsburgh ,5,2016-07-31
Food was spot on delicious  There s a reason the line is out for door for this joint ,5,2018-07-02
The food was outstanding  Steak was cooked perfectly  Absolutely worth the wait in line ,5,2019-09-28
Fantastic food and good service   The best steaks we ve had in the  Burgh ,5,2017-12-27
Gaucho is pretty good  Having gone a handful of times  I can t say it s line out the door good  but it s definitely worth checking out   I ve almost always ordered the Parrilloda Mixta in order to try a bunch of meats  but every time I kind of regret my decision  mainly because of the how tough the NY Strip is to get through  The chicken is good  but doesn t have too much flavor  so you ll be using their sauces to get through it  their sauces are excellent    If you re going with the red meat  I d definitely recommend the flank or lomo  They always seem to come out cooked to perfection  They season their meats with salt  traditional Argentine technique   so expect a sodium overload on flavor  and if you don t like salty  you probably won t like a lot of their food   The sides are hit or miss for me  The empanadas are okay  but they ve been pretty dry whenever I ve tried them  My favorite side is the Guacho Papas  I could eat these all day  Perfectly roasted potatoes  The humita is also phenomenal  I d definitely recommend the papas and humita if you re on the fence when ordering  I ve never had either of those let me down   Ultimately  where Gaucho succeeds is their great  personable staff  fast service  and mostly better than average food  Also their newer  expanded space is beautiful  Gaucho s struggles rest with inconsistent meat preparation  especially the oft overcooked  tough strip   being too salty for the salt averse customer  long lines on the weekends  and price  don t expect to leave Gaucho will a cheap bill   If you can get there in off hours  right after work  for example   the wait will be short and you can be in and out quickly  but I wouldn t put Gaucho in the must eat category that s necessary to justify standing in a line that wraps around the building  It s good  but it s never been THAT good  Enjoy ,4,2015-10-08
This place is absolutely amazing   I travelled to Pittsburgh for    months for work  eating out twice a day for the entire time   This is absolutely my favorite restaurant of all that I tried during that time     Suggestion  The meat is really amazing  so I would suggest that you separate it from the bread in the sandwich   The bread is great by itself as well ,5,2014-02-05
You ve already heard that the sandwiches are great  so I ll focus on the other aspects     There was obviously thought put into the decor and the design of the space   There s lots of great decorative accents and fixtures throughout   It s a small space  but super cute   The patio area also looked very cozy   Customer service was also great    Personally  I was really confused by the chalkboard menu   I had no idea what any of the categories were   I had to ask the cashier   Which ones are your sandwiches     and  What s all the other stuff    She was super friendly and was more than happy to explain their menu to me   When my sandwich was ready  the manager    brought me my sandwich and was also very friendly and even took the time to explain their sauces to me   Seriously  I was very impressed by the customer service    Not because they made any huge gestures  but it was the very genuine  unhurried  and unpretentious attitude and treatment that I received    We all know what it s like to walk into the new hot spot hipster hangout and get the typical unimpressed and unfriendly customer service      Now on to the sandwiches    I ve had their infamous steak carne sandwich before and it was delicious   Even as leftovers   So  this time I tried the Rosemary beef sandwich   Also very good  but could have done with a little more horsey sauce in my opinion   There s a big chunk of meat  so luckily I had taken the suggestions of the staff at Gaucho and gotten a little bit of the ojo sauce to add to my sandwich     All the other items looked so yummy  I can t wait to come with more people to try all the sides and options   If you haven t already given Gaucho Parrilla a try  make sure to stop by the next time you re at the strip   It s also on the end of the strip  so that makes it an easy stop for lunch if you work dowtown ,5,2014-07-03
The line does tend to wrap around the block  we saw it earlier in the evening   Tip  go later and go when it is raining  We experienced no wait under these circumstances  After our order  we waited very little time for our food to arrive at our table  The place is casual and you immediately feel comfortable  We got the fungos  Cremona mushrooms  shallots  sherry vinegar  rosemary   cammarones  grilled rosemary  garlic shrimp w  lemon   pescado   fish of the day   and asado platter  all   cuts of wood fired steak  This was the best meal of my Pittsburgh trip and I will be craving it a lifetime  No other shrimp will ever compare  The meat  oh the meat    All five cuts were perfectly medium rare  One tasted better than the other so I kept going back and forth  Loved the mushrooms  The fish was good but everything else overshadowed it  I ate until I was in pain  Service was friendly  We brought a bottle of wine to accompany our meal  The overprice for the quality resulted in a high value meal   I can t wait to return here ,5,2016-08-13
This place is the bomb  Food is cooked to perfection and the flavor is phenomenal  Line is always way too long but they do a good job of keeping it moving  Food is fresh and delicious  Staff is really friendly too ,5,2017-09-23
What can I add to the other reviews  What a great restaurant  Everyone I talked to loved their meals  I had the Cerdo  pork  plate with a Papas Dulce side  The small plate was more than enough for me and had wonderful tastes  Don t miss this Argentine treat ,5,2016-11-10
Delicious rosemary beef sandwich   Grits are amazing too   Most savory sweet potatoes I have ever eaten  Perfectly spiced  You must try this place ,5,2017-01-31
So another positive review of this place   YES  The steak is so good  Seasoned perfectly and cooked just right  I got the steak sandwich with NY strip steak  It was a lot of food and was delicious  My wife got the flank steak on a plate and about ate the plate that came with it    The yellow rice unfortunately left something to be desired  It was bland and relatively flavorless but the steak more than made up for it    There are other meats on the list as well but I don t know if I will ever try them because of how good the steak is    Mmmmmmmm ,5,2014-09-25
Might be one of the best places to eat downtown period  Love the chimichurri s and bread  The meat is ok too  I need to try the chorizos next they looked awesome  I would say half of the employees were really nice ,5,2015-10-24
Amazing food at decent prices but they need to change their ordering seating procedure ,4,2018-04-16
Amazing  I can t believe how good the food is at Gaucho  I ve only eaten here once but will definitely be back many more times  The veggie sandwich is one of the best veggie sandwiches I ve ever had  The concept was pretty basic but they managed to make it taste SO good  Also the grilled corn on the cob  perfect  At first I was a little skeptical  when the food came out the corn looked really bland  But oh my goodness did it taste so good  Just the right amount of butter and grill flavor  The only dish I feel that was a little bit lacking was the Provoletta appetizer  It was just a piece of toasted bread with melted cheese on top and a side of arugula with a tiny bit of dressing  I feel the dish could have been a little more creative  I liked the grilled cheese concept but the bread was really hard and thick and the cheese could stand to be a little more gooey  And the arugula needed more dressing and maybe some diced grilled peppers or little pieces of fresh mozzarella  anything to add more flavor  Not worth ordering the Provoletta  try another appetizer instead   Highly recommend Gaucho  Can t wait to go back ,5,2015-08-20
There s no rave I can make that hasn t been made here already  BUT  the accolades bear repeating  Get to Gaucho and get yourself the best beef in the  Burgh  Bar none  Holy cow  pun not originally intended  but okay  I ll roll with it   this place is amazing   In the mood for a steak sandwich  Well  what kind  Your choice of flank steak  skirt steak  ribeye  strip or filet  Or how about chicken  Or shrimp  Chorizo your thing  Or possibly the fish of the day  All piled high on a HUGE ciabatta style bread with your choice of toppings  and sauces  Chimichurri  pimienton  garlic   I can t remember what the other one is  Want some grilled veggies on that  There are too many to list   just ask for what you want  chances are they ll have it   Going light and want a salad instead  I had the Gaucho salad with the skirt steak  grilled tomatoes  carrot  avocado  asparagus and roasted corn all piled high on fresh  beautiful greens  Or maybe you d prefer the Argentino with roasted potatoes and portobellos   Get ready for sides of corn on the cob roasted in the husk over the wood fired grill  Oh  All the meats and proteins are grilled over wood that you ll see stacked in the back and in the front under some of the counters  That s part of the secret of the flavor   Desserts  too  are pretty darn special   Not much seating  but there are a few stool and counters inside and a few tables outside  Get there while the weather is beautiful   come to think of it  it might still be worth it sitting in    degree weather in your parka just to savor the flavor of smoky summer ish goodness ,5,2013-07-15
Love this restaurant  The grilled meats  veggies  salsas  tostados are very good   The indoor decors are festive and colorful   Get the Parillada Mixta  a sampler plate of meats  The meat empanadas are best   The salsas are great  especially the Ajillo one   There is always a long line to be seated  so be patient  or come in at non peak hours ,5,2018-05-01
Awesome ribeye steak sandwich  awesome corn  the staff is very friendly  the food speaks for itself with the flavor of the wood in everything  The only thing I didn t care for was the soggy bun  it didn t really matter that much once I bit into the delicious sandwich  that had ribeye steak  caramelized onions and roasted red peppers with chimmichuri sauce  One recommendation would be to cut the meat against then grain  then when your biting into the sandwich you don t pull whole chunks of ribeye out and have to pick up with your fingers  With that being said  yummy and I will be back   ,5,2015-01-04
Read a lot about the wait and it was out the door when we got here  Get here about an hour before close as they stop the line near that point  Also BYOB  All that said the food is worth the wait  The steak was cooked just right and had a great spice ,5,2017-07-19
Went for a late lunch  so it wasn t too packed  You walk in and order at the counter  and the staff was incredibly helpful and patient  There are a variety of sauces you can get  which were all excellent  especially the chimichurri  We ordered a sandwich as well as an actual steak  Both were delicious  as we re the sides  and the sandwich came on bread that was toasted and perfect for absorbing all the juices  Definitely a must go for anyone in Pittsburgh ,5,2017-12-22
I ve been meaning to come to this place years ago when they first opened but never had the opportunity to do so   either because something came up or the long was awfully long  However the opportunity presented it self as I had to visit Heinz History Center for a morning event  Since it was only few minutes walk from the center  it was the perfect excuse and time to finally pay Gaucho a visit   Although there wasn t any line outside  the inside line was a different story  The order line was pretty cramped and right around to a point where any additional people would have to wait outside  As I was standing on the line   the long list of menu on the chalk board was somewhat overwhelming but you can always ask to the people before or after you for recommendation  And pretty much everyone will recommend something different  I looked up on Yelp and since I was craving beef   I went with the Rosemary Roasted Beef  I also ordered a  Dog Bone     Yes you heard me correct   A Dog Bone for my new puppy     The folks behind the counter are super friendly and helpful  Once you order  someone will guide you to a seat and your food will be at the table in no time  If you are with someone   I would recommend both ordering something different since the sandwiches are pretty big that you can actually split among the two  However  I cleaned out the entire sandwich by myself  The roast beef juicy  well seasoned and just cooked to perfection  Caramelized onion and horsey sauce made it just perfect without overpowering the roast beef  If you want more variety of flavors there are   specialty sauces that you can add   The atmosphere here is very casual  industrial like or may be I should say farmhouse like  specially with all the stacked woods  and lively  Everything is reasonably priced especially for the portion you get  Like me don t let the long lines discourage you  It s definitely worth a visit ,5,2017-01-30
I didn t review this place  I came here a year ago  and I m STILL thinking about it  In fact  I was just browsing photos when I realized I didn t review it   I live in Cleveland  but I am literally planning a trip to Pittsburgh just to eat at Gaucho    I had the chicken  and it was the most amazing meal I ve ever had  Well okay I don t know  but it sure was close  The best part is the   different sauces that you can have pretty much unlimited amounts of with your meal  I kept going back and getting more  I was even eating them with a fork     Get here early or be prepared to wait a long time  The line was out the door at lunch time and we got the last table in the place  It s just that good ,5,2016-09-09
I don t know if there s a better place in Pittsburgh to eat red meat  This place is wonderful  The inside is small and isn t truly  sit down   though there are a few places to sit stand   the patio next door does provide seating and is a great place to eat some meat  Added bonus  it s BYOB  and the staff is always a pleasure   The steak samplers are the way to go with sides of potatoes  corn on the cob  mushrooms  and or vegetables  The lazy susan with their sauces is amazing and they are all delicious  We ve had less luck with the sandwiches  which are still good  but I thought the rosemary braised beef had too much meat   was too soggy and needed a crunchy ingredient  such as pickled onions or arugula  I also though the empanadas were a little ho hum   My biggest wish is that they d extend their weekend hours later ,5,2015-01-07
After hearing all of the hype about Gaucho Parrilla  I decided to finally check it out after months of wanting to go  There was a group of six of us that decided to go on a Wednesday evening at  pm  The line was out the door and down the street when we got there  and it was pretty cold out   We waited in line for a total of about an hour before we ended up ordering our food and getting a table  The staff was very nice and when we got through the door  they offered to get open our wine for us and get us wine glasses while we waited  Gaucho is BYOB with no corkage fee  which is a huge plus  The six of us brought a total of four bottles of wine to split between us   I ordered  the large Provoletta as an appetizer  My fianc  and I decided to split our meals  so I ordered the large Cordero  lamb  and the large Bire de Chorizo  NY strip  for us  Both were cooked perfectly  I loved all of the flavors  Make sure to try all of the sauces that they have  They compliment the meal perfectly  I have no complaints at all about Gaucho  and I would highly recommend visiting  even if it includes having to wait outside in the cold in line  Gaucho definitely lived up to all the hype and I will be returning in the future ,5,2017-01-04
The new standard in what a restaurant should be  The steak will blow you away  Everything I have tried there has been great  This is the one place that never fails to meat  that s a pun  or exceed my expectations  This is hands down my favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh  If you try it once I m sure it will be your new favorite as well ,5,2015-05-17
always the long line in this place but it worth the wait Ribeye is awalys my favorite,5,2017-11-26
Delicious  Had rib eye plate  we tried all the sauces each one had awesome flavors  Also had an order of veggies and potatoes  All I can say is everything was incredible  So happy we stopped there  ,5,2015-03-13
I am staying at the Omni William Penn for work and was looking for something different than room service    I was not disappointed  The sauces are so flavorful and the right amount of spicy  I had two pork empanadas and kicked myself for not getting more  The flank steak was cooked to medium perfection and so flavorful  I ve been to Pittsburgh many times and this is by far my favorite restaurant  I will definitely be back to try more menu items  Oh  and the service was excellent ,5,2018-04-11
I crave Gaucho on the regular  And those sauces  whoa  Anthony and his staff are great ,5,2015-05-30
Meat had good flavoring  Loved the variety of sauces available  Vegetable empanadas are the best  I also had chicken empanadas  but feel in love with the veggie  Sevice was excellent  Only gave it a   due to gnats near our table and sauces ,4,2015-12-25
The Strip District  Pittsburgh s home to most ethnic foods and fresh seafood  recently got a new neighbor   a restaurant serving up wood fire grilled fare from Argentina  I am not familiar with Argentinian food  so I was eager to try it out when I heard about the place  The space is next to the   th street bridge Near Altar Bar   so the cold weather had prevented me from making the hike up  until there was a nice warm break and I was finally able to walk up   The space itself is minimal  imagine a pizza shop       of the building is dedicated to the kitchen  the remaining     is left to standing room  There are about   countertops to eat at  but no stools  On the wall there is a menu  written in chalk  separated into about   sections  Small Plates  Hambre  Hungry   Salads  and Con Pan Sandwiches   There are   types of condiments in jars in the middle of the restaurant which are there for your tasting pleasure  Chimichurri Herbs  oil  lemon   Ajo garlic   Cebolla onion   and Pimenton Roasted pepper   Gaucho also offers various ways to receive     off on different days  Wednesday  show your facial hair doesn t have to be real  ladies    Friday  show your fashion flare    So far I ve had tastes of quite a bit of the menu   The Vegetales sandwich     I think   two steak sandwiches Flank and ribeye      lets you choose from any beef they offer   Shrimp          hambre menu    Empanadas Beef  onion  and hard boiled egg         Chorizo      small plate menu   and a pollo sandwich      The empanadas were hands down the best that I ve ever tasted Which should be taken with a grain of salt   the steak is incredibly flavorful and juicy  the shrimp were very large  with a sprig of rosemary stuffed into the back of each one and a lemon that was charred on the grill as well  The chorizo was full of peppery flavor and just a little bit spicy  and the veggie sandwich was piled high with peppers  zuchinni  and asparagus my friend ordered without portabello     You can also order two slices of oiled  grilled bread for     The bread here  a fresh ciabatta  is stunningly delicious  soft throughout and a crust that  while chewy  won t resist you as you bite into your sandwich  I highly recommend ordering the bread so you can try out all of the condiments  I m a sucker for caramelized onions  so the cebolla is my favorite  but the ajo is a close second  with the others also being incredible    I ve only gone around     pm  and there is usually a short line  but I m not sure how this place handles around dinner time  or during the lunch rush  I asked about catering and the chef said that one day they ll be able to  He also said that he dreams of doing a whole cow roast one day   a goal that I can wholeheartedly stand behind   Gaucho is a welcome addition  and I am sure I will find myself a regular here  If you work in the strip or downtown  block of some time and make the walk  If you don t  then drive down on the weekend or for dinner  Their website sums it up nicely   Eat Gaucho  ,5,2013-02-16
The wait is usually pretty long  but food is literally amazing ,5,2017-07-17
Food was okay  Steak was close to warm instead of hot and the char was just a tad bitter  Had better authentic Argentinian food in other cites ,2,2017-06-07
Small  and I mean really small restaurant at the end of the strip district  Specialty is Argentinean style meats  If you are a meat lover  this place is a must  although they do have some vegetarian options  Try the sauces  they compliment the meats   Love the place  only negative is that they close rather early       p m ,5,2015-02-22
This place rocks  Great atmosphere  cool layout that adds to the vibe  great service  and down right well cooked food   I just stopped in Pittsburgh for the day and was pointed in the right direction with this place   Had a large order of med  Rare Flank covered in Chimichurri  side salad  Toast  and a side order of shrooms  Definitely will be back the next time I m in Pittsburgh ,5,2016-11-10
Hear a lot about it and finally decided to try  Awesome food  service was great  Fast  helpful  and very willing to accommodate change up their options  Would love to go back ,5,2015-03-19
I honestly can say  this is the most phenomenal food I have tried in PA   hands down  The employees were excited about their product  the other customers were exuberant about the place  and we had an incredible experience  The corn  rice  pollo sandwich and steak sandwich     all were incredible  We WILL be back  ,5,2015-08-23
I have been here a few times now   I love the expansion on the side  Now you can order and eat  before it was a tiny place and you had to get it to go most times  The food always seems fresh and different than the usual burger sandwich places ,5,2015-10-22
The meat choices perfect  busy place  very good flavour s but what threw me off a little bit was the char the meat the pulled pork was absolutely perfect and the chicken wings were Really good i could do with a tad spicier but if I were to go again these would be the dishes I d order,4,2017-01-15
Can t miss place   In the spring and summer I miss the Brussels Sprouts  but this weekend the Humita made up for that   Be sure to order this side dish    Goes well with the pork    You ve been made aware of the long line   don t be bothered with that   Stick it out ,5,2016-05-10
We had the rosemary steak sandwich with meat and cheese tray   The meal was excellent as usually   We brought a bottle of wine  they uncorked as we ordered   They have wine glasses there for your use   Order extra grilled toast their dipping sauces are terrific ,5,2016-11-10
This little hole in the wall in the Strip is serving up some yummy grilled food  The first time we tried to go here they were out of chicken  and I don t usually eat beef  so we went elsewhere  I thought about docking them a star for this  as actually having the food that s being offered on the menu is a big part of running a successful restaurant  but  after having eaten here  I think the place is   star worthy    There is no table service here  and really no tables other than the ones on the patio outside  There are a few barstools inside  but the comfort level is low  as you have people milling about  either standing in line or waiting for their to go orders  and the space underneath the stools where your legs and feet would normally go is taken up by stacked wood  As a side note I ll say that it s too bad there s no place in the Strip  such as a small park or some other public area  where people can go and congregate   it would be a nice addition to the neighborhood  and there are a couple of take out places that could benefit  The outside tables were all taken when we arrived  so we ate at the counter on the barstools  We ordered the chicken from the  hambre  side of the menu  and sides of the grilled veggies and gaucho potatoes  This was a good amount of food for the two of us  The chicken comes  picked  and served with their onion sauce  a delicious concoction of caramelized onions that have been pureed and seasoned  The veggies were grilled perfectly  and the potatoes were delicious  We helped ourselves to the sauces they offer   a roaster red pepper sauce  a garlicky ajo and their version of chimichurri  that Argentinian staple  All were very good  They really know how to cook here  and the food is delicious  I hope they become successful enough to afford a move to roomier digs at some point in the future  In the meantime  I ll still go and hope for an empty barstool ,4,2013-10-04
What makes this place unique is their originality  Rosemary and beef   Who would have thought those flavors jive   Be prepared to wait a bit   It s worth it    All Sandwichs come on a freshly baked  Artisan made roll   Shazam    Must check out when your in the strip district  ,4,2016-01-09
Hands down  my favorite place in Pittsburgh  You can t get better food quality for this price  And the restaurant allows BYOB  You seriously can t go wrong  There is always a line that wraps around the building itself  so I recommend that you go on non popular dining times to really enjoy  I recommend filet sandwich and use all of the toppings that are offered to dip the bread and meat in at the table  The mussels are to die for as well ,5,2017-03-15
This place is amazing  I had to drag my boyfriend here but he was thanking me afterwards  Skip the filet mignon cut and get the steak sandwich with ribeye cut  Ribeye just tastes better than filet mignon on bread  It comes with roasted red peppers and caramelized onion on ciabatta bread  Dip it in the fantastic chimmi churri for a good time ,5,2014-07-13
This place is so good   Having spent   months in Argentina  I  do love a good parrilla  w  bomb chimichurri   and this is legit  And BYOB  However  the timing is key  since there are no reservations and the line can be insane   When they do the basement chef s tasting menu  you can reserve in advance  and skip the line  worth it   ,5,2017-01-15
We wanted a  cheap  preview of this restaurant  so we chose the steak sandwiches  I had ribeye  hubby had flank  Word to the wise  get the deconstructed option right off the bat  else you will just do it yourself  We tore the delicious bread into hunks and paired it with the perfect bite of fire roasted peppers and caramelized onions and steak  trying each sauce  My hubby like the green best  but I couldn t get enough of the red  The dessert of the day was to die for  It was worth the wait in line  May I also add that the ability and encouragement to get your own water and sauces is perfect  I hate asking waiters for a ton of stuff  Great atmosphere ,5,2017-05-26
Just get the steak burger and all your troubles will disappear  Awesome outdoor seating as well  I will definitely be coming back ,5,2018-07-11
So  Good  Other than the staff getting really perturbed with you if you aren t standing in the correct spot  due to long lines out the door   it s incredible  Note  get there early   Go with a group  Get everything  Share  You ll be really full halfway through but press on    You re welcome ,5,2016-10-26
I loved Gaucho Parilla  The rosemary beef was really good and with a little sauce  it was amazing  Easily the best food I ve had since moving to Pittsburgh in   months ,5,2016-02-12
THE Question to ask yourself at this place is  does the good food make up for the Mean Nazi like seating system that requires customers to wait outside in    degree temps   and don t block the effing  entrance  versus being seated in any of the abundant empty tables    The old man acting bossy boss was downright rude from the moment I walked in   How bout kindly saying  hey  do you mind sitting at a bar stool till your food is ready   I m seating people who have gotten food already in these tables     my spouse was in line ordering instead he was aggressive and rude  Stupid system and mean customer service   Rudeness can easily outweigh good food   Answer   not worth it,1,2017-11-07
Get the flank steak  and add chimichurri  That is my advice  You can t go wrong here  Everything is amazing  They have   sauces that you can help yourself too  but the chimichurri is easily the best  All of their entrees are fantastic but I can t stray away from their steak  The potatoes are a perfect side dish  I ve never been disappointed here ,5,2018-02-16
Read about this place on Yelp and since I was in town for a few days  I knew I had to try it  We ordered the shrimp  carne hanger steak sandwich  grilled veggies  potatoes  grilled corn  and   bottled waters  Our total was almost       That s a little high for what I m accustomed to paying for basically a carry out joint  but hey  you only live once    While we waited  I stocked up on the sauces because I wanted to make sure I had the opportunity to sample each one  The chimi sauce is awesome  btw  We got our food and we were off to the hotel room to enjoy it  I started eating the potatoes in the car because    They smelled delightful     I m pregnant  And     Who gon  check me  boo     You could tell the potatoes were batch cooked because some were piping hot  while others were just luke warm  It s a good thing my parents were in Michigan because the flavor of those hot potatoes would ve made me slap my mama  Seriously though  the fresh potatoes were very  very good    The corn was awesome  My hubby thoroughly enjoyed his shrimp and veggies  The flavor of my hanger steak sandwich was off the charts  but it not as tender as one would hope  The toughness of the steak caused me to deduct a star  Overall  this is a solid place with great food and awesome flavors  Definitely a must try ,4,2015-03-22
If you love steak  you will love this place  Everything we ordered was fantastic  I suggest ordering smaller portions of the steak so that you can try more cuts and really figure out what you like  BYOB is a fantastic perk  My boyfriend and I did not have to wait for more than   minutes to get a table on a Thursday night  which was great ,5,2017-08-04
This place is awesome   Try the steak sandwich   You wont regret it   Great place for a quick lunch   The food is awesome and the service is quick and friendly ,5,2013-02-22
Mmmmm tasty    I ordered the small flank which was accompanied by a rich salad of dark greens  radishes and carrots  and a large slice of toast  The steak was cooked to perfection  I did not participate in any of the sauces unfortunately  My fresh garlic allergy did not allow me  The only reason I knocked off a star was because I ordered my meal without garlic anywhere due the allergy and my steak came out with the chimi sauce on it  which does in fact contain fresh garlic  So  I had to send it back  which I really loathe doing  The staff was great about getting me a new steak quickly  however  the rest of my party had already consumed a good portion of their meal because we had to get back to the office ,4,2016-05-07
Maybe I need to go here a few more times and try more things  Ultimately  I liked my steak sandwich  but I think my expectations were too high  We arrived early on a weekday and there was no line  I really didn t have time to read or understand the menu as we didn t wait in any line  The menu to me was confusing with too many options  I got the steak sandwich with hangar steak  The bread was very good  It was so messy though  I think I went through about    napkins  I don t recommend this for a first date or a lunch during the work day  We also had the cauliflower which was ok also  I have had much better  If I lived in the area  I would give it another shot  Maybe I just didn t have the right thing ,3,2018-05-30
As a non real meat eater  I didn t think there would be anything for me here  But  I eat fish  and they have fish  and it is AMAZING  The shrimp was really really good and the BF enjoyed some pork and steak    And the owner is pretty cool ,5,2014-11-13
frozen chicken and dried up old salad  no thanks  I gave this place two     tries  and every time I have left disappointed  As many have said  once they expanded they dropped significantly in food quality and have now turned this once great place into an eat n park  The original place was about quality food and good service  now it s about making money and trying to cater to the masses  Will not go back ,1,2015-09-29
This place is so small you probably can miss it if you re walking down the street   What you won t miss is the smell   The odor of wood burning and meat can be experienced well down the street   You know how smell and taste senses are tied together   Yes  that     The place is really tight inside   There s only bar stool seating along the perimeter of the dining area and a table in the middle with sauces   The set up can be a bit uncomfortable in a sense that everybody is facing a wall or outside and there are people waiting for their orders and or seats to open up   I was in line and my wife took the only   seats that were available for myself and her as I was in line waiting to order   Another couple was ahead of me ordering their food and I wasn t sure if they were eating in or taking out   Another person waiting around was waiting for his take out   Well after that couple ahead of us had finished ordering they had nowhere to go just standing in the middle of the floor as all the stools were taken and some other customers that were done eating seemed to just be sitting around and talking and not really making room for new customers looking to have a seat and eat their food   I had ordered a chicken sandwich and a steak  rib eye  sandwich   While the flavors of these sandwiches were absolutely amazing the steak we both had a hard time with  we split each sandwich in half and shared each    The steak seemed to be really tough to bite through chew   Don t get me wrong the taste was absolutely amazing but the meat seemed rather tough to bite and chew for rib eye   The portions are very generous   The amount of meat on these sandwiches are NOT skimped at all     Along with the sandwiches I had ordered a corn and the roasted potatoes  papas    The potatoes were amazing but I really had to wait a while for them to cool off as they were really hot   I guess the tip for future is steak is good but not in a sandwich because it s juicy and the bread gets a little mushy and the meat is too hard to bite   A plate that we can cut with a knife and fork would probably be better   I m not sure of the rib eye as the meat was generous and thick cut  the meat seemed less tender than I as expecting for rib eye steak     If it wasn t for the toughness of the steak sandwich I could easily grant   stars for Gaucho   I would love to try the pork loin next time   For the   sandwiches  potatoes  corn and one Limonata the bill came out to just under    bucks   Not a bad deal for the quality they pump out of this hot spot ,4,2014-12-08
So good  I have been trying to come here for ages  and I am so glad I finally made it  I had the vegetales con pan  a vegetable sandwich  and it was so good  I also had the grilled corn on the cob  which was also amazing    The line was long  but it was worth it  The vibe of the restaurant is also very cool  The man who took our order was extremely friendly  Once you order your food  you take a seat anywhere and a waiter will walk around calling the name you gave for the order until they find you  It s a cool experience  There s definitely a long wait for the food  but it s totally worth the wait ,5,2015-06-10
As soon as you drive in front of Gaucho Parrilla your stomach starts growling because the Argentinian grill smell that comes from this place is just awesome    I shared the asado plate with my wife on my first  and only visit so far  to Pittsburgh and I thought it was just delicious  Being on a low carb diet  it is hard finding good stake dishes without all the other very tempting sides but this one needs no sides   The only temptation was the buttery bread that came with the dish that my wife and son were raving about    All five cuts of beef served were great quality tasting meat  very tender  very juicy  and perfectly cooked  I like my steak medium medium rare     On a plate with NY strip  filet  sirloin  and flank  I thought the skirt stake was the winner  I would love to try their chorizo  I can t wait to return    The restaurant is very informal without waiters  you order at the counter and they bring the food to you  so seating space could be an issue  But it wasn t for us    All I have to say is that  given I am on a high protein low carb diet  I would be going to this place every single day if they opened this restaurant in the DC metro area  But  for now  I will be content with the fact that I can only eat here when I visit Pittsburgh so this is a required stop for us when we return ,5,2013-08-06
DON T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINAaAaAaAaA    I finally tried this Argentine chacusary styled restaurant  There is a line outside so you know something is up   See  the way it works is you order your food from the chalkboard and pay for it  collect your drinks  sit down and get served one time only  You have to walk around and find your own water and drinks but they still want a tip    I ordered the Carne steak sandwich with roasted peppers and I chose sirloin meat  I ordered the side of rosemary garlic clove potatoes which I ate with my sandwich which boosted the flavor  Everything is slightly charred   It was fun to try different styled food ,4,2018-07-08
I had an absolutely incredible salad with shrimp   The only downside was the lack of seating during lunch  but good for them   Fast  reasonably prices  delicious ,5,2014-08-29
If I worked closer  I d have my lunch here daily  Filet sandwich hit the spot but the sides are the real deal  We had the roasted red potatoes  mushrooms and corn  Delicious  Plus  all the homemade sauce options are bottomless  Try as many as you want  and get as much as you want  What s better than not having to ask for extra extra extra extra hot sauce ,5,2017-05-04
Wow  my favorite place for steak without a doubt  Argentinian style steak so highly seasoned and a great char  Small location and usually about a half hour wait  No seating in restaurant but a few high tops for eating  I would definitely recommend eating at the location as on the   occasions that I have gotten takeout my beautiful medium rare has turned to medium well due to carryover in the box    Amazing food and people a must visit ,5,2015-04-16
My boyfriend and I were passing through Pittsburgh on the way to the airport and needed lunch  Thanks to yelp  we went to Gaucho and were extremely happy  Between the two of us  we had the hanger steak  rosemary braised beef sandwich  steak empanadas  and maiz  Everything was delicious  we will definitely be going back if we are ever in Pittsburgh again  The place is quaint and cute  the staff very friendly  I highly recommend ,5,2014-10-01
My sandwich was awesome   the grilled veggies were phenomenal  I ll definitely be back ,5,2015-10-22
Great place for delicious steak in a low key atmosphere  Also had salad and roasted vegetables which I also enjoyed  Aside from generally being a tasty choice  if your dietary persuasion is of the paleo keto variety  this place should be   A on the list ,5,2017-08-11
Never disappoints   except the long lines outside    Always an excellent go to with vegetarian options available in addition to delicious perfectly cooked meat options as well ,5,2018-03-09
Yum  I m in love  what we had  Ribeye  wings  beef empanadas  wings  potatoes  corn  brown sugar pineapple bread pudding   Amazing  Worth waiting in line  BYOB if you want alcohol  The line moves really fast   the service was good  Excellent first experience  I ll be back ,5,2016-05-07
Oh my gosh  this is just outrageous  literally one of  the best things I have ever tasted   The sauces are on another level and the meat is to die for   I ordered my steak burger medium but it came out medium well  who cares it still tasted like heaven on earth   Huge caramelized onions  melt in your mouth cheese  delicious meet and some of the best sauce I have ever had   I m upset that I have been waiting so long to try Gaucho out   The line is always crazy so I chose to call ahead for take out  This could be one of  if not the best places in Pittsburgh  Try all the sauces and do not hesitate to order large portions  you will absolutely crush your meal    I am so excited to go back and try different things   Please go to Gaucho it is worth the wait  the prices are fair and the food is unmatched ,5,2017-05-30
Yuuu up  This spot is the  ish    This was one of our last meals in the great state of Pennsylvania and we couldn t have ended on a higher note   The staff is outstandingly rad  the food is truly executed to perfection and the atmosphere is so casual cool that you ll think you re on a picnic   We had    New York strip   bone in chicken  breast and thigh    I know what Chef Boyfriend likes    house made chorizo    grilled veggies   and ALL the sauces    My only regret is that we hadn t brought a baller bottle of Argentinean Malbec to wash down all this smoky  meaty goodness  The shop is BYOB and you definitely should   They ll be closed for a bit while they expand the restaurant  yay    but as soon as they reopen  so yourself a solid and get yer butt down there ,5,2015-04-07
Everything we got was delicious  The line wasn t too long  We only waiting    minutes or less  The meats were all amazing  The corn on the cob was my favorite part of the meal  Will definitely go again  Would have given   stars  but it was a little pricy  Wonderful food though ,4,2016-04-19
Incredible food  a bit pricey too  For such a well reputed place I wanted to give it my all and got the     steak sampler which included every beef cut they serve  Each one was made to perfection medium rare  The seasonings of cilantro  onions and garlic was excellent  I don t recall the name of their one vinegar less sauce but that was to die for  The ribeye me was my favorite and if I go back I will get a sandwich of that now that I had the pleasure of trying all through the sampler  Despite the popularity and long line it moved surprisingly quickly  The place draws both locals and  Tourists alike  A must when visiting Pittsburgh ,5,2015-02-11
Had steak sandwich  a little too fatty for me   Kind of expensive  Small place  but fun   Rest of meal was good to go    Will definitely go back ,4,2014-04-09
The food was very good thus the   stars   But waiting in line is a deterrant to a repeat visit  Also having to BYOB is inconvenient   We also felt rushed as it s hard to enjoy your meal seeing other patron s eyes on you waiting for you to move so they can sit and eat   We went around   in the afternoon  so the line wasn t horrible  but we felt rushed to order when we finally got to the counter   We got the Paella to share with our party of    as it was huge along with potatoes and the roots as sides   In some ways this dining style reminds me of Chipotle  just at a higher level   Food was tasty  just wish the place would expand into a bigger space ,5,2017-12-31
My mouth is still watering from the incredible meal I had here  We ordered the filet mignon sandwich  cauliflower  green beans and pork sandwich  Not to mention the   different types of sauces they had and boy do I love sauces  The chimichurri was super tasty as was the onion one as well  It s BYOB with NO cork fee  Can t beat that  I would highly recommend this place  The food was phenomenal and fresh  and the atmosphere was welcoming  It can get a little loud in there but it just adds to the excitement and conversation  The line was out the door but it was beyond worth the wait  You order first at the counter then get seated and given wine glasses and they call out your name for your order  I ll be back for sure  It s not everywhere you can get non dry meat and flavorful too  Yes please ,5,2018-08-17
Expertly executed beef with deep maillard crust  fresh beef flavor  exquisite sauces  and big soft garlicky bread  Executed in the Argentinian  Gaucho  tradition    Expect to wait in line for this meal  It s well worth it  I ordered the Carne Sandwich with the Ribeye option  The Ribeye was perfectly tender  cooked exactly to my medium rare preference  The crust was salty  deeply savoury  and slightly reminiscent of green aromatics  This is some of the best beef I ve ever had  It is unquestionably worth the price just for this beef    The sandwich comes on a buttery type of foccacia slathered in garlic sauce  The bread is soft and chewy  It s quite excellent  However  I found it to hide the flavors of the ribeye too much  So I pulled apart the sandwich and ate it in pieces    The sandwich is topped with carmelized onions and red peppers which balanced the sandwich s flavor profile with sweet and acidic notes    I tried the Ajo and chimi sauces  I found the chimi sauce to be a bit too  green  for the ribeye  I much preferred to dip into the Ajo  Garlic     Gaucho is clearly an iconic part of the contemporary moderately priced Pittsburgh food landscape  The attention to detail and respect for natural flavors is executed at a world class level  If you come to Pittsburgh and like food  skip all the carby sandwiches and come first to Gaucho ,5,2017-11-26
I regret not trying this place sooner  Just the smell when you first walk in is intoxicating  Just as a warning there is not much seating area so I would recommend going for take out or go during an off time     I ordered the hanger steak which came with a salad and toast and some sort of saut ed onions  This dish was very  very flavorful and looked as amazing as it tasted  I usually take a picture of every dis I order  however  I was too hungry and the smell was just too good for me to waste any time taking a picture  It is basically medium rare though so if you are not into that then maybe try something else or ask for it to be cooked more  It was certainly an adventure for me because I am more of a medium person and like seeing pink not red  My friend ordered the Carne sandwich with rib eye and man it was bigger than I thought it would be  It  Was  Incredible  I would for sure recommend this dish to try first  There are also   sauces to choose from on a table and since I am a big fan of sauce and it was my first time I decided to try them all as a dip to the sandwich and toast that came with the hanger steak  They all add even more depth and tastiness to the food  Either way the flavors are there    Lastly  The service was great and comforting  I don t know if it was the manager or the owner of the place that asked how the flavors were and made sure we were happy with our dishes  but it was a great surprise to see someone care so much for the outcome of everyone s food  Basically just go and go now ,5,2014-09-14
I really really enjoy this place  I think the food is just simply wonderful  My husband and I typically get the same feast every time we go  we ll start with the provoletta and picada  and we ll both typically get the rosemary braised beef sammy  OMG to all of the above  especially the provoletta and the sandwiches  Great place ,5,2016-01-19
The quality of the food at Gaucho is outstanding  I tried the NY strip  pork  cauliflower  potatoes  and empanadas  all of which were delicious  We waited in line outside for a hour on a Saturday night and it was worth every minute  After we finally reached the counter and ordered we were quickly seated and our food arrived about ten minutes later   Gaucho is BYOB and we brought a bottle of wine which they opened and poured for us   An excellent overall dining experience made exceptional by the amazing quality of the food ,5,2018-04-08
Food was good  but since you order at a counter  you don t have a server  but someone will bring your food  Don t go expecting to sit  relax  dine  and talk with friends  They will start clearing around you  It s all about turning the tables ,3,2017-01-05
Fun atmosphere and good food  The empanadas were excellent  I ordered the Cerdo  pulled pork   It had excellent flavor  but was a bit salty  The roasted cauliflower and red potato sides were OK  but I d skip them in the future so I had more room for the main course  The peanut butter and chocolate bread pudding was also great  The staff was friendly and efficient  There was a line out the door when we got there  but we moved through pretty quickly and were given a table as soon as we ordered  Definitely a fun place and worth the visit ,4,2017-09-23
Amazing food and super friendly staff  definitely worth the wait  I love the empanada and the small meatball plate  Also the sauces there are amazing  definitely try them all ,5,2016-07-18
Just as good  Definitely crowded on a Saturday afternoon  I got in at       and had to wait in line to order but when I left the line was out the door and around the corner    I need to remember to get my steak medium  I usually get medium well but I was served well done    This time around I tried the wings which were very good  the potatoes which were overly seasoned probably wouldn t get again  and the grilled corn which was so good    There sauces are amazing and found out that you can purchase them to take home  I m going to use that on everything ,5,2016-09-03
This is my first time experience here  I read so many good reviews so I just tried it today  We had chorizo  hot   empadanas  chicken and veggie   Cerdo  paletilla De cordero   Among them  only chorizo and the empadanas with chicken filling were good  Cerdo was super salty  I couldn t finish it  the onions so greasy and almost burnt  The lamb shack  paletilla  was bad  like tasteless and not so well cooked ,3,2018-01-27
Most consistent food in Pittsburgh   Always an amazing experience   Must stop if you are in the burgh   The gaucho salad and the mushrooms were a favorite ,5,2015-03-09
Had a wonderful experience at this restaurant for a private event  My friend was getting married and held the welcome reception or all her guests here  The basement has a trendy and cool vibe to it  with private alcoves cit wining comfy velour couches behind the main dining area  The meat was fantastically cooked and the sauces to die for  I would definitely come back here for the full dinning experience ,5,2018-09-28
I ve never been compelled to leave a review for a restaurant  Especially a restaurant that has had so many favorable reviews  I came to Pittsburgh for a business trip and stumbled upon the Yelp reviews of best restaurants while looking for a place to dine  The reviews were so good that I thought I would be disappointed in the actual food  I lowered my expectations a tad bit simply so I wouldn t be disappointed  This restaurant blew away and surpassed all my expectations   This place does simple and clean food  exceptionally well  And there is no better standard than that   Also  I inadvertently  made sex noises while I ate the ribeye  This shit is real good  REAL GOOD FOOD ,5,2016-11-17
I ve been here for lunch three times in      during the week and on the weekend  The food is always amazingly awesome  but the line to order takes a lifetime and seriously detracts from the overall experience ,3,2018-08-08
I have tried the Bondiola  the Pollo  and the Carne sandwichs  I had the Carne with flank steak and arugula and it was amazing and perfect in every way  this one was bar far my favorite  My boyfriends favorite was the Pollo  which he ordered with goat cheese  I would have enjoyed the Bondiola more  except I found it way too salty  The complimentary sauces make the sandwiches even more amazing than they already are ,5,2016-02-01
Like the other       reviews on this place  I couldn t say less about this Gaucho Parilla  I went on a Monday around      pm  planning on going on a self guided food tour of The Strip  This was my first stop  I found myself waiting on line for about    minutes  which I had been giving warning  but about    minutes of that time was spent in DEEP THOUGHT over what delicacy I would eat  I went with the NY Strip steak sandwich and at the friendly  hip cashier s suggestion  the rosemary potatoes as a side rather than the pork empanadas  I ate happily alone at counter  feeling not at all alone and more so openly welcome by the wait staff  All I have to say to end this review is that my food tour ended at this first stop  This was one of the best meals of my life ,5,2017-07-12
I have wanted to try this place for a loooooong time  I work on the North Shore and every day going to and from work I smell the deliciousness of meat being smoked when I pass Gaucho going over the bridge in the Strip District  But finally the day has come    My husband and I actually went here before a Yelp event  that Gaucho was actually providing small bites at   go figure   I got the rosemary braised beef and potato and bacon soup  The sandwich was so big  I  actually just ate the meat because I didn t want to fill up on bread  It was soooo good  I could probably eat a steady diet of just that morning noon and night for a full week  There was a horseradish sauce on it that really paired well with the rosemary flavor  The soup was also incredible and super flavorful  I probably could have done without it because the beef was so filling  but I m glad I got it just to taste it  My husband had some sort of pork sandwich with pickled onions  He couldn t stop raving about it so it was also a win   One thing I also want to comment on is how extremely friendly the staff is  You can tell how much they love their business and care about their customers  If you aren t sure about a menu item  be sure to ask for a full description  Someone will be happy to tell you about it no matter how busy they are    The space is more of a food counter than a restaurant  so if it s busy you might want to consider getting your food to go  but I see they are looking to expand soon so that s very exciting    I totally understand why this is yelp s n mero uno in Pittsburgh  If you haven t gone here yet  you do not know what you re missing ,5,2014-11-13
This place is currently closed for renovations  The men outside were very friendly and told me that the restaurant will be reopened very soon  I plan to return here and update my review since I am very much looking forward to dining here ,3,2015-05-17
This is my  go to  restaurant when I m anywhere within an hour s drive of Gauchos  It s a reason for me to look forward to business travel to the area    As a former Pittsburgh resident  it s just yet another reason for me to miss the city  If you don t go because it s terrific go for those of us who can t go as often as we would like  You won t be disappointed ,5,2018-07-19
Top notch place  Space  food  staff  and atmosphere are all excellent    I went to Argentina a few years ago  and have been starving to get my hands on more  Seeing that Gaucho had opened excited me  and it exceeded the lofty expectations I had  Upon entering  it was very obvious that Anthony was excited about what he was cooking and wanted to share it with us  The menu is vast  with salads  sandwiches  small plates  and entrees to fit any time of day or budget  I had the papas  potatoes   flank steak  and empanadas  All were cooked to perfection  and the ingredients were fresh    It s a great place for lunch  and they have tables you are able to stand at in the restaurant  They are working on outdoor seating for when the weather improves  and it s going to be quite exciting   All the food is cooked over wood fire on the parilla  thus making all the flavors immense and very complex  The owner and staff are very knowledgeable and have really built a great place in Pittsburgh ,5,2013-02-22
The food is close to authentic Argentine and very tasty but it is very clear the management has a ridiculous view of themselves   I have been there four times since they reopened and the disorganized approach towards serving customers is laughable   The skinny blond guy in the baseball cap walks around swigging Yuengling while lecturing customers why they should wait and why it is  cool  they have run out of all the popular items  Twice i have witnessed him explaining to customers how wrong they are while holding up a long line  all while holding a beer in his hand    Meanwhile it is total chaos with one young lady trying to take orders with a long line while two order stations go unmanned because managers are sitting with customers drinking beer or laughing it up in the back of the house  which avtually disrupts the cooks   I hope these aren t owners but maybe just relatives      so they can fire these guys and hire people that know the front of the house   If not  I am confident they will lose the buzz of new restaraunt popularity and be out of business in a year because of the hideous customer experience ,1,2015-06-13
I was lucky and there was no line when I arrive  The menu is a bit confusing  but the staff was patient and eager to help  The food was delicious and hearty  I loved that it was BYOB as well  Great spot for any night of the week ,4,2016-07-25
I d heard about Gaucho through the grapevine for a while now  After eating there twice now  once in March and another just last week  I can honestly say I m going to go back as often as possible as long as they ll have me  There s a reason the line is out the door every time I arrive  and it s well worth the wait  This is my first and only Yelp review because I can t think of any other establishment worthy of such praise ,5,2016-05-22
So maybe you re wondering   What s all the fuss and why is there always a line around the block     Do you like an exceptional meal that sticks out in your memory long after the last bite  So do all of those people in line  I promise  it s worth it  so get your spot in said line while you finish reading this review   Gaucho is really first and foremost about the meat  I go for vegetarian options quite often  but I can t do that here  You only need to inhale the smoky  savory aroma that cloaks this establishment like an enchanted fog to get the idea  I ve tried several sandwiches over the years  including the Chory Pan and the Pollo  but the Rosemary Braised Beef is legend  and I keep going back to it  It s a perfect combination of flavors  notably  the marriage of rosemary and horseradish sauce  On my last visit  I finally tried their empanadas and Humita  corn pudding   Delightful  although I still stand by the sandwiches   Pro Tip  ha     Go at an off time  I ve gone either right at   AM or between   and    and the wait is incredibly shorter  Just have an early or late lunch  let me reiterate  it is SO worth it ,5,2016-08-04
Went to Gaucho on a beautiful day and was able to enjoy my meal in the outside sitting area  My friend and I had gone for dinner on the earlier side to avoid long lines and wait time  Despite being early  we did have to wait in line to put in order    I ordered the vegetale sandwich  which has grilled asparagus  grilled onions  roasted red peppers  roasted potatoes  as well as mushrooms served on a ciabatta bun  Along with the sandwich  I got a veggie empanada which was nice and fluffy on the outside and the filling on the inside  was spiced just right  Both of these options paired wonderfully with Gaucho s   homemade sauce  These sauces really took the flavor to the next level  For dessert  I got the alfajores  I expected them to be hard on the outside  soft on the inside  but the cookie was delicate and melted in your mouth  It was exquisite     Gaucho is a great option to get some quality food is Pittsburgh  It is definitely on the pricer side  but you won t leave unsatisfied ,4,2017-05-30
It s a no brainier       five star reviews  This is the way food is suppose to taste  Do yourself a favor and go there   now  Why are you still reading this     go ,5,2015-09-09
Yelp  Rarely lets me down on a search for good eats in a new place and tonight I am so grateful to them   This is some of the most amazing food I have ever eaten in my life   The staff was friendly the food was   star dining in a casual fun atmosphere   Don t let the fact that you order at the counter just means you have several people who check on you to make sure you are happy   I do believe I have experienced the most delicious flank steak of my life   And I think it s so cool that they have a BYOB policy no need to pay     for  oz of wine   This place is a total win if you don t come and eat here while your in Pittsburg well then your just plain stupid ,5,2015-08-20
Where to start   the empanadas  the braised beef sandwich  flank steak  or the grilled shrimp  It s all amazing  When in the strip if the lines it too long this is the place  Gaucho has this down pat ,5,2016-03-18
Gaucho is well worth the hype  I visited after a friend spent an entire day telling me how great this place was  I was fully prepared to be disappointed  Our first attempt at getting into Gaucho s was on a Friday night  and we were already a little late to the party  The line can be fairly long  and the restaurant isn t a big place  so the wait can get a little lengthy and daunting  We had places to be that night  so we decided to come back the next day for lunch  We made sure to get there early and got a reasonable spot in line    Drinks are the first things ordered and you get them while waiting in line shortly before you order food and pay  There are   options for seating  indoors and in a small outdoors area immediately outside  We opted for the outdoors spot since it was a nice day  and it was great  My friend and I ordered the carne sandwich  with filet  medium rare   a ribeye plate  empanadas  and grilled corn  We were hungry    Carne sandwich       The meat was amazingly cooked  tender and flavorful  The ciabatta bread adds significantly to the sandwich  I m pretty sure it would not be as good with any other type of bread  The chimichurri sauce complemented the meat nicely  and the array of sauces that are available inside all tasted great on top of the sandwich    Ribeye plate       The meat again was top notch  The toast was nicely done  not too dry and not too rough to eat  Plenty of flavor to add to the plate  The salad was a typical salad but was an appropriate amount to combine with the remainder of the dish   Empanadas       We ordered the beef and chicken empanadas  The empanadas are reasonably priced and very nicely done  The shell is toasted to a nice crisp that is also easy to bite through  The empanadas were packed  and were certainly a good portion  All of the contents tasted great    Corn       Corn was lightly grilled and appropriately buttered  Great flavor  but not anything out of this world    Even though we were outdoors and somewhat secluded  waiters made sure to find their way to our table to refill drinks and make sure everything was tasting good  Service was excellent  The only issue with this restaurant is the possibility of a long wait  however that seems to be a growing problem at all great restaurants  If you come a little early  the wait shouldn t be too bad  The parking options around here are reasonable and we found parking     blocks away    Definitely recommend coming here   I would have come back the next day however they are sadly closed on Sunday ,5,2016-09-19
Too many amazing restaurants in Pittsburgh to wait in line for     minutes  My beers were cold when I got there  I swear  Sad because I was a loyal fan and customer   The ordering process is not working  Fix it ,3,2016-09-23
Steak is perfectly cooked medium rare over a wood fired grill  and thrown on a thick  garlicky  buttered  grilled ciabatta bun with red peppers  onions  and your choice of an Argentinian sauce  The Ribeye is my favorite when they got rid of the skirt  Love the flank  strip  and filet too  Easily in my top   sandwiches ever  If you haven t gone yet  well shame on you ,5,2015-05-03
The food is fantastic especailly if you are a meat lover the servings are large and filling the place really has an awesome look and feel  and the service is beyond great   Thumbs up,5,2015-08-07
Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is one of the absolute best restaurants I ve ever had the pleasure of eating at  This is our go to place and is well worth waiting in line to get in  The food quality is always superb and the service is always friendly and fun  They do a great job of keeping the food consistent every time and keeping the quality very high even though they are always swamped    The rosemary braised beef is one of my favorites and always has a delicious wood fired taste with great caramelized onions  a delicious horseradish sauce and homemade bun  I like to put their AJO sauce on it for an extra bite    The provoletta dish of melted provolone cheese on top of house made bread with an assortment of olives and arugula is also a delicious side to any meal and their wood roasted corn is to die for   When I first moved back home to Pittsburgh after an extended stay in Florida the first place we went on the way home from the airport was Gaucho ,5,2017-01-15
I was here with a group of six very picky eaters  one might be the pickiest eater I have ever meet  After the meal was all done everyone had great comments about there meals  No one had a single complaint  As far as my meal I had the ribeye cooked medium rare with the chorizo and empanadas as an appetizer  The steak was perfectly cooked and had great flavor especially with the house sauces provided chimichurri sauce was my favorite but the ajo sauce and pimento sauce where also good  caution  pimento is a hot sauce not terribly hot but if you don t like any heat beware  ,5,2016-12-07
Amazing  First day in Pittsburg  came here with the family for lunch and got the chicken sandwich  Also tried the steak sandwich  We had a side of roasted potatoes and a generous helping of all their sauces  Everything was fresh and delicious  It was our first time in Gaucho and the staff was attentive and really nice  They talked with us and explained the menu really well  Worth every penny  If I lived in Pittsburgh I would definitely come back ,5,2013-07-18
If the line is out the door and half way around the block    WAIT   It will be worth it  I got the flank steak sandwich and it was one of the best sandwiches I ve ever eaten  The steak and chimichurri sauce is the perfect combination  The sandwiches are all on focaccia bread which is delicious  but I highly recommend getting it  de con   without bread  as it s actually hard to eat as a sandwich  I pulled mine apart and ate the meat and grilled vegetables with chimichurri  then dipped the bread in the sauces separately as a side  They have   great sauces for you to try with your meal  They re set out so you can take as much or little as you d like of them   Tip   Call your order in for take out so you can skip the line ,5,2015-09-25
The sandwiches are so  so good   This is a place everyone has to check out  I prefer the chorizo or Rosemary braised beef ,5,2016-08-08
Best restaurant in Pittsburgh  Green sauce on the steaks was some of the best steak sauce I ve ever had  Garlic bread and brussel sprouts were also A  Get yourself a nice bottle of red and enjoy a meal and wine at half the price of some of the nicest Steakhouses in Pittsburgh  Casual  fun ,5,2017-02-10
Pretty amazing   JUST GET YOUR ASS THERE   Their Rosemary braised beef sandwich was pretty bangin  like all the reviewers said   Man  it s the perfect bread    The way all the juices squeeze right into the bouncy sandwich  omggggg     The gentleman forgot to ask me the temperatures of my meat and I totally forgot to tell him   I soooo didn t want my meat medium or well done   It s okay though  the flavor was incredible regardless   Next time     We ate so fast  I thought my stomach was gonna explode   All you hear inside is silence   It is THAT good  ya ll   Love their vegetable dish drizzled with balsamic redux   I literally saw my veggies being rubbed with olive oil and going on the grill  I loved that   Roasted plum tomato was a perfect touch   Their salad greens were incredibly fresh and well seasoned  something I really appreciate   Radish and carrots were shaved to order  not pre shaved and stored in water  thank you for that   Really   Oh  and the caramelized onion is definitely the hidden gem   Last time I had those was like      yrs ago  ugh  love them   And the   special sauces    Forget about it  man  Jesus Christ   If you ve never been there  I feel sorry for you      MOVE UR ASS SOLDIER    ,5,2015-02-26
Truly an amazing restaurant  Went because of Yelp reviews and I was not disappointed  Wings and lamb were phenomenal  Food on the menu all showed an adherence to quality  Staff can come off a bit rude at first but the service is fantastic  Looks like they also serve corn on the Cobb but it s not on the menus so ask for it  Can t wait to go back ,5,2016-04-26
Get take out to skip the wait   It s still good when you bring it home but make sure you get the sauces   If you like fire and meat  then this place is for you   All dishes  except sandwiches  are cut for you and are very good to share   The meat is typically cooked medium rare without having to be asked  and the place is BYOB ,5,2016-04-26
It took me awhile to get here because I thought it would not be vegan friendly   BUT I finally made it and the veggie sandwich is amazingly good  I also got a small salad which was perfectly fresh and delicious  though unnecessary because the sandwich was huge  I really love all the sauces they have available  too  The service really takes Gaucho Parilla over the top   so so so genuinely enthusiastic and friendly  The space is rustically cozy and the sandwiches are a bit messy  all part of the fun  Yep  this place is fun ,5,2014-02-25
Awesome stuff   The sauces though    um  so great  but they get really nasty when    people have made their way through them   I got sick the next day  possibly from the heavy grease of this meal   Was so tasty though,4,2015-10-29
The only thing I m disappointed with is my not knowing of Gaucho s existence sooner   My friend and I both had the carne sandwich  mine filet  his skirt   and they were simply melt in your mouth fantastic   The sauces were also incredibly fresh and tasty  so good in fact that we purchased a container to go   Great food  friendly staff  unique environment  what more could you ask for   A carnivore foodie s heaven ,5,2014-03-15
My wife and I made an unexpected overnight stay in Pittsburgh on our way home from Niagara Falls recently  After checking into our hotel  we hit up Yelp to find a great place to eat in the Steel City  I used the search filters and found Gaucho Parrilla by searching  highest rating   As soon as I started looking at the pictures  it dawned on me that I had stalked their page within the past year because I had seen their restaurant named on the Yelp top     list       We immediately made plans to head straight to Gaucho  After driving around the block a few times  I wasn t too sure if we would be able to find a parking spot for the massive SUV rental  but we were finally able to get a good spot on the street just down a bit   We loaded up the parking meter and started making our way towards Gaucho    as we got closer and closer  I could smell the meats cooking in all of their meaty glory  I wasn t particularly hungry that day  but the smells emanating from the place took care of that in no time  Upon entering  everyone was super friendly and very helpful when it came to introducing us to their menu and pointing out a couple of options that would be great for first time Gaucho ers  We tried the meat platter  Beef  Chicken  and Sausage  as well as the pulled pork with caramelized onions  My personal favorite   I have to say  I would be hard pressed to remember a meal that I enjoyed more than the one we had that night    the flavors at Gaucho are on another level of amazingness  If you are anywhere near Pittsburgh  go out of your way to try Gaucho  you will not be disappointed ,5,2016-10-31
Amazing food    The sandwiches are HUGE  The meat is always tender and the sweet potatoes are to die for  It can get expensive but it is worth it ,5,2017-08-30
This restaurant has the best steak in Pittsburgh   No kidding   It is prepared over a genuine wood grill  not gas  not even charcoal  but wood  then cut in thin strips for serving   Seasoning is simple salt and pepper but when combined with the wood flavor  it is phenomenal   The various chimichurri sauces are good  but unnecessary   In addition to the beef  Gaucho Parrilla offers excellent grilled vegetables  toast and sandwiches   The only seating is in the outdoor garden   There is no indoor seating  only counters to stand at   Come  enjoy the smells and defiantly the beef ,5,2014-01-07
Great food  Love the grilled veggies   Assorted sauces are great and I recommend you try them all  can t go wrong   Service is fast and friendly  Hope they expand soon for more seating ,5,2015-01-26
Seriously  More than a     reviews  and an average   star rating on Yelp  It s certainly rare to find a restaurant with   stars after this number of reviews   I had to try it to believe it   Food            Simply incredible   The first time I visited Gaucho  I went with the most frequently mentioned Yelp item   the carne  steak  sandwich   This sandwich is HUGE   Generous portions of a cut of your choice   I go for the ribeye  which is a great choice for flavor   Other components of the sandwich include roasted red bell peppers  onions  chimmi churri sauce   The bread just absorbs all the juices from the meat and roasted peppers  not letting any flavor go to waste   If a sandwich is not your thing  there s certainly a variety of other proteins for your choosing  both from the land and sea   I was surprised and impressed with how absolutely delicious Gaucho s camarones  shrimp  were   I m always weary of ordering seafood if I m not near the coast line  with the concern for freshness   But goddamn  these shrimps were hella succulent   Sooo succulent   Other worthy proteins include the chorizo  chicken  and flank steak   If you re in the mood for some vegetables  Gaucho s grilled corn  and their mix of asparagus  portabello  onions  peppers  zuchinni  are also great choices   If you still need more flavor  there are   sauces to help enhance the experience       chimmi churri  fresh herbs  garlic  extra virgin olive oil  vinegars      pimenton  charred pepper  garlic  fresh herbs  extra virgin olive oil      ajo  roasted garlic  fresh herbs   extra virgin olive oil      cebolla  carmelized onion  rosemary  thyme  vinegars   extra virgin olive oil   Service           Family owned business are always great   The two brothers running this joint never fail in making you feel welcome  and are full of energy and enthusiasm for the food they prepare   Ambiance            The place is small and cozy  and unfortunately there are only a handful of stools for people to sit on  as they enjoy the greatness of Gaucho   Overall Opinion   Incredible food   Awesome service   What more could you possibly want   Well  my only annoyance with this place are their business hours and the very limited number of seats for people to chill out and enjoy their food   I heard they are about to expand  so this will solve the latter issue   Their business hours were a major influence on why it took me more than half a year after moving to Pittsburgh to finally visit this place   It would be great if they opened until at least   or   pm   It would also be great if they opened on Sundays   Nevertheless  their business is thriving  and certainly not short on customers   Like I said in the beginning of this review  Gaucho had an average of   stars after     reviews   I now understand why   It is TRUTH   Now make your pilgrimage to this fine establishment in the Strip District ,5,2014-04-05
To say this place lives up to the hype is an understatement  My co worker and I decided to take a break from the ordinary and venture down to the strip to see what all the fuss about Gaucho really is    We both ordered the Steak Burger and let me say it was one of the best things i ve ever eaten  I tried all of the   homemade sauces on the   pieces I cut the huge sandwich into   In my opinion this is truly the best way to eat everything here  The attention to detail in the preparation and presentation shows and shines through their product   With the expansion of the restaurant occurring now I cannot wait to try it again  The much needed expansion will allow even more people to enjoy the amazing food Gaucho has to offer ,5,2015-04-08
Chicken was not cooked all the way  and the food was mediocre at best    would not recommend ,1,2016-10-06
I ve waited in a line outside for an hour and half to eat at this place before and I d do it again   maybe even if it was raining       Surprised I haven t written a review about this place yet    I ve gone to gaucho a handful of times now and I ve NEVER been disappointed  Not only is the food incredible the staff is amazing and I always try and leave them a glass or two of wine    everyone loves BYOB      There are a ton of options  Sandwiches  meat platters  salads  small bites and you honestly CANNOT go wrong  For first timers  I recommend the parrillada mixta  a platter of various meats gaucho has  with a bunch of whatever sides you want  It s a great way to get a feel for what this place is capable of   Yesterday my boyfriend and I went and got the asada platter  incredible    the mussels  also incredible   and the camarones  make sure you squeeze the lemon on top    did I say incredible      There are only   things I m not a fan of      The chicken  I m super picky about the way chicken prepared and unfortunately  on several occasions I ve found it a little dry here  Sucks because chicken is great      At night I wish they would dim the lighting to create a more intimate cozy atmosphere   HOWEVER  don t get it twisted ladies and gentlemen  This place still deserves  stars for its deliciousness  friendly staff  and consistency ,5,2017-02-15
So  so  so good  And now that they ve expanded  you can actually sit in the restaurant  yay   The patio looks awesome  but on our last visit we chose to sit inside  We had our   month old with us  and the owner and wait staff were very welcoming  She loved the ribeye and braised beef  as did we  I see that this is the highest rated restaurant in Pittsburgh on Yelp  and deservedly so  It s fantastic ,5,2015-08-21
I was saving my    th Yelp review for somewhere special  and Gaucho deserves my triple digit cherry   You smell Gaucho before you see it  freshly prepared tender meats and chimichurri sauce massage your nose from a block away     Gaucho means cowboy in spanish  and you will eat a cow worth of the juiciest steak you ve ever had in your life   Everything on the menu is delicious and perfectly walks the line between traditional and inventive   Very reasonable prices  friendly accommodating staff  a fun  unique style  and generous portions  My steakburger was roughly the size of my head  and yes  I still managed to eat the whole thing    The only thing they could do better is get bigger and expand for more seating  but since they do discounted take out  I d be glad to take it home and be a Coucho Gaucho in the comfort of my living room ,5,2013-12-17
Gaucho did not disappoint  Outstanding meal  I ordered the   oz ribeye with a side of potatoes  and corn  The corn was to die for  The roasted potatoes were selfish too  Seating is a bit tight in this place but I guess that speaks to the popularity ,5,2015-08-13
I was in heaven as soon as I walked in and looked at that board  My only regret is that I had never been here before   A friend and I walked in a little past  pm on a Tuesday  and it wasn t over crowded  but we had to wait for a group to leave to get a seat  No problem  though    We ordered the meat plate to share including chorizo  chicken  and steak  This was easily the best chicken I have ever had  All of the meat was delicious  tender  and bursting with flavor  Seriously  melt in your mouth good   Watching the people working cut the giant hunks of meat is also entertaining  I love a place that sources their food responsibly  i e  hormone antibiotic free  presumably local  as possible  and they delivered  The quality of this food cannot be surpassed considering time and price    As a paleo eater  this is going to be a mainstay this Summer  I can t wait to enjoy the outdoor space ,5,2015-03-21
It s so worth the wait in line  Delicious     Also   Please open another spot with parking as it s so hard to find a place to park near your Strip location ,5,2017-12-18
it s about time i review my favorite spot in the burgh    gaucho never disappoints  amazing food every single time  even when I order blindly  The staff is super friendly and approachable  easy     ,5,2017-05-05
I have been to Gaucho many  many times and each time I m reminded that it is hands down the best place to eat in Pittsburgh   if you want the meat sweats   In fact  many years ago  I d eat lunch here weekly before they had a ventilation system and even then           I always go with at least a party of   and go all in with the meat platter and a bunch of sides and bread  family style  The BYOB option is incredible  The process to order and sit is very streamlined and I appreciate the ease    Make sure to try all of the sauces  each one is delicious     bringbackcampfireyams,5,2017-01-17
Great authentic food  A must do when you re in Pittsburg  Party of   and everything was delicious  ,5,2017-08-09
I have always seen a line outside but I didn t even know what the restaurant was  My boyfriend and I were going to try the sushi place next door tonight but when we got there all we could smell was the food coming from Gaucho  My mouth literally was watering  The line was decent so we decided to give it a go  SO FREAKING GOOD    The shrimp was honestly the best I have ever had  it was grilled to perfection  My boyfriend got the Parrillada Mixta steak  chicken  chorizo   The steak and chorizo were amazing  the chicken wasn t anything spectacular  compared to the rest that is   We also got a side of red skin potatoes and mushrooms   DELISH   It was a perfect date night  We will for sure be going back with friends    ,5,2017-02-24
Unbelievably good   One of the best foods I ever put in my mouth   I had camarones  choriza     lb ribeye  veggies  and extra grilled bread  which comes with all four sauces for dipping   It was so fresh  flavorful   Everything was herby  smoky  salty  sweet  and sour in the right proportions   The steak was high quality and cooked perfectly   THe atmosphere is so much better than you would expect   The cashier was so helpful and the chef owner chatted me up and was entertaining and delightful   I recommend everybody gives them business asap   I will definitely be back ,5,2013-02-27
The only bad thing about this place is the LINE   No reservation  first come first serve  The wait is about  hr at  pm  and more by  pm and later   Avoid game day  Steeler   Pirates   Pens    It s going to be so packed  it s crazy    Been here so many times  Sandwich on my first visit  Paella and Asado platter when I had a big party  and steak plate for   or     If you have a big party and want to try everything  Paella and Asado platter is the way to go  Asado platter covers all the steaks they have  But Asado platter does not have salad  which individual steak plate do     In terms of salads  go with the ones with roasted items   I do like that hot greens more than their mixed salad  You can add grilled items for a few dollars too  I normally get a grilled portobello for an extra dollar or two   BYOB,5,2017-08-14
Friendly  they know how to handle a lot of people at once  dinner rush   That is not to say it is fast  Take it easy and enjoy the time  The food came out terrific  We had bouilliabaisse  camarones  and a mushroom side  Great atmosphere  It is BYOB  btw ,5,2017-05-20
Absolutely amazing and true to the ratings and reviews  Best steak sandwich I ve had   A must try ,5,2014-11-07
A friend and I stop down for a Saturday lunch the wait was a little long    min  the line was out the door however  the food was excellent  I will definitely go again  the sandwich was on thick sour dough bread and they were very generous with the meat portions  Fantastic Argentinian food   ,5,2015-07-18
This place is   star  Everything was delicious  I came at lunch and got here early enough I only had to wait in line behind   ppl  I ordered a chicken sandwich  mashed sweet potatoes side  and a provoletta  Love the mini salsa bar   will definitely return   I do recommend reading the menu on their website ahead of time as it can be confusing   hard to see depending on lighting etc ,5,2017-05-02
Wow  Easily the best ribeye steak sandwich I ve had  The chimmi sauce is incredible and should be put on everything,5,2015-02-07
I m not sure what all the fuss is about  Maybe it s cause I m from LA and we have AMAZING food  but this place doesn t live up to the hype of its reviews  The meat itself was cooked and seasoned well  but the sandwich had no flavor  And I ve never had a sadder empanada in my life  Dry and no flavor  Empanadas are supposed to make you happy and dying for more  we were fighting over who HAD to eat the last one ,2,2015-06-19
Food  amazing  waiting in line to get into this place   not so amazing  Came on a Friday night with   other friends  and the line was clear outside and wrapped around the building  I ve heard some great things about the food  so I decided to stick it out and wait  After about an hour and    minutes  we were ready to order   I like the concept of this place  you wait in line and order and the food is brought out to your table  They also have a BYOB policy  which makes it really nice to just bring a bottle of wine to share   Once the food arrived  I was amazed  The chicken empanada was perfectly flavorful  The chicken sandwich was absolutely huge and had the best fluffy bread  My favorite part of the entire meal though was the roasted pepper red sauce  I would put this sauce on anything and everything ,5,2018-01-27
I still remember this place when it was a hole in the wall walk in shop with deliciousness that you can smell from down the street   The shop has expanded  but it s still hands down as good as it gets when you get a steak sandwich topped with their house made chimi s  my favorite flank topped with garlic    My wife and I have tried most of their items on the menu and all of their entrees are great including the steak salads  chicken and fish  Their sides can be hit or miss at times  but a lot of times that s because they experiment with new offerings   One thing to watch out for is their lines  It s always out the door  but definitely worth the wait  The service is always extremely friendly and it s BYOB ,5,2017-07-30
Great choice of meats and great flavors    Paella needs more flavor but it was good  Wait times are pretty long but it s a really popular place  Even going for really late lunch times     pm   it was somehow still busy    Ambiance is great  Definitely a must go place if you re visiting Pittsburgh ,5,2018-08-07
So the line for a Thursday was crazy  so they started offering  limited  spots in Bodega  downstairs  where they happened to be hosting a   course fixed menu  It was my husbands birthday  and we had heard so many great things about the food  we decided to give it a try   Bodega offers a slightly elevated atmosphere with the same flavors of Gaucho   it did not disappoint    The first course was a cross between chorizo and salami  Serrano ham  ch vre  manchego  kalamata and caselveltrano olives   It was served with grilled bread and chimmichurri   Then was an heirloom tomato salad with a delicious pork beef meatball   Then the entree  grilled steak  corn on the cob  shrimp  more grilled bread and a variety of vegetables   The Rosemary onions with the steak was out of this world   They brought out our pineapple cobbler  so ridiculous   with a candle for my husbands birthday   a very nice touch  We will definitely be making reservations for downstairs in the future ,5,2016-07-29
Easily one of  if not my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh  You pretty much can t go wrong with anything here  I ve had the steak  ribeye and flank   shrimp  chicken  and roasted pulled pork  my favorite  and they have all been fantastic  This may sound weird to say about a steakhouse  but the salads and grilled veggies are actually my favorite dishes and some of the best that I ve had period  The beet salad and their caramelized onions in particular are great  as you can really taste the wood fired smoke on the onions which pairs well with their sweetness  Trust me you want to get these on your sandwich  salad  meat  pretty much any dish  The staff there are also always really friendly and attentive  and are more than willing to help you out when ordering from the big board menu  Yes the line can be long at times  but it is definitely worth the wait ,5,2018-03-06
AMAZING FOOD    Sauces were fresh and yummy  Would go every week if I ever moved to Pittsburgh   ,5,2014-10-22
We had a delicious meal here   It took awhile for the dishes to arrive but they were worth the wait   Definitely  go with the filet  the corn pudding  vegetables and the grilled corn   The only disappointment were the clams  which were in a great sauce but many of them weren t opened when they hit the table  which means we had to send them back  They took them back  with a smile  Definitely  try it out   It s a cool vibe and a great meal ,4,2015-08-14
The food is absolutely   Star  Long line typically  and tight difficult seating take the overall experience down a notch  There are not too many non chain authentic South American cuisine places to eat in Pittsburgh  this by far is one of the best  BYOB makes it an ideal place for a date night with friends to enjoy a bottle of cab ,4,2018-06-04
This is the best steak sandwich I ve ever had   When it came out of the kitchen  my eyes teared up a little because it looked and smelled like the sandwich handcrafted in the heavens by the Angels     I had the flank steak sandwich with the wood fire roasted veggies   Uggggh the chimichurri sauce is so good   I m starting to feel emotional again   The house made cibolla  onion  sauce was pretty outrageously good too   I can t wait until they expand so I can sit down with my friends there for dinner ,5,2014-11-24
Like this place needs it s    rd review   Lines are out the door already  right   Well I m glad I was in line and I d get in line again  as the place is really good and a unique experience   People super nice   Food is interesting and high quality     Note this is BYOB   i m fine with water but I kinda which I d rolled in with a bottle of Rioja  that would have been the bomb ,5,2016-04-15
Whoever thought it d be okay to have a copious amount of meat for breakfast is just sick in the head  and I m all for it  On a summer weekend road trip to Pittsburgh  said no one ever     friends and I went on a food excursion through the city of steel  Gaucho was a big surprise to me having grew up in Los Angeles and not expecting such an eclectic array of eateries in a place like this  We lined up right before they opened and got in after around    minutes  just the perfect amount of time to build up an appetite  We got the sampler and a side of okra  just to appease my flexitarian appetite   Yum yum and yum  The meat has just the right amount of charcoal and steam  with its juice oozing out right before your eyes  You can feel the warmth of the slab of steak before taking a bite  what a treat  Do note that this was an incredibly sodium tastic meal  I d say they could use less salt for their dry marination  And don t forget the salsa  try em all ,4,2018-03-24
Stopped by after picking up kid from Pitt  Came on a weekday  Grab your condiments  cutlery and stuff prior to selecting your food  I loved my lamb chops  This is an Argentinian restaurant   so it came out braying  Lol  Great food will stop again ,4,2016-04-28
We made a special trip to the Strip District to try out this Argentine steak place and it was worth it   You order your food at the counter  which saves money and time   We came for lunch and the line was short with plenty of seating   Recommend checking out the menu before you go as it can be a bit intimidating with people waiting in line behind you   Not knowing what to order  we started with the Picada  sampler of cured meats  cheeses  fruit  bread  and Empanadas   The sandwiches were huge  but looked like too much bread for us   We then ordered the Parillada Mixta  which was   lb of grilled meats  steak  chicken  and chorizo  absolutely delicious   Meat was moist and perfectly seasoned   Will definitely return and will stick with the meats ,5,2017-10-13
Absolutely delicious  The line is always worth the wait  If you like meat  this is your place  The empanadas are always tasty  Definitely add this restaurant to your list ,5,2017-09-14
  stars  I d give it   if I could  I had the pork and tried it with all of the amazing sauces available  The pork was cooked perfectly with tremendous flavor  The texture was something that could be imitated  but not mirrored  I will be back to this restaurant as soon as possible ,5,2015-07-28
The food was amazing  The menu is a little confusing if you have never been there  But so worth the wait,5,2016-01-08
Food is honestly amazing  Unbelievable flavor  This should be a must stop for anyone in town ,5,2013-10-24
With a seasonally changing menu  I would highly recommend the cuisine at Gaucho  Known for steak on an open wood fire grill  this restaurant features in house made everything from sauces to desserts  Non traditional restaurant style but cool  fun and worth the wait    Fav  Rosemary Braised Beef  Vacio  El Gaucho Salad   Tip  Byob no cork fee  tipping is for the entire staff and don t be afraid to add fresh toppers to your plates ,5,2016-11-13
Hands down the best restaurant in Pittsburgh  Everything is absolutely delicious  The combination of high quality ingredients and wood fire flavor makes every dish on the menu incredible   If it s your first time at Gaucho  I would recommend trying the carne sandwich with filet  you can have any cut of steak on the sandwich for the same price   I find myself craving this every time I come  But don t be afraid to branch out and try the chicken  pork  fish  and sausage dishes  I have not had one bad dish in the many times I ve visited  Even the simplest dishes  like the toast  taste so much better than anything I ve had before  Gaucho makes seemingly simple dishes outstanding   The atmosphere is casual and laid back  and you will enjoy it much more if you have an easy going attitude  The lines can be long  and you may have to wait a bit for seating  But the staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating  Take advantage of the BYOB policy and enjoy a drink while you wait in line  I promise it is worth it ,5,2016-02-24
I came here with my mom on a Tuesday night  around     pm  When we arrived  the smell outside was amazing and there was a line around the corner  so we knew this place must be good   The wait was pretty long   probably about         minutes  which is pretty popping  for a Tuesday   When you get inside  you order your food and drinks at the counter  get a seat  and they bring your food to you    We ordered the small flank steak plate  a steak sandwich  and an order of the carrots  All of the food was         tasty  well prepared  plated beautifully  and well worth the wait  You get a lot of food for your money  it was     for all that     Overall  I would definitely recommend this place as an affordable but exciting dinner spot ,5,2017-06-28
Wonderful choices  cooked perfectly    Large menu but they manage it well and there are no bad choices  The lines have been mentioned    Go right at   if you want an early dinner  rain also helps ,4,2016-08-13
Really one of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh  Definitely a must try and go to place   Can bet a bit pricey depending on what you order and seating is really difficult    They need to find a better system on how they seat their customers   The review is based purely on the food     the service maybe a    The people that work there seemed stressed and unpatient ,5,2016-12-04
Wow  Where do I start  Great food and seasoned well  Great service  Permanti Bros is great  but gaucho is top notch  Highly recommend while in strip district ,5,2014-07-03
The food here is amazing  hands down  I remember when this place was a matchbox and now that the repairs and expansions are done it s a marvelous sit in spot  Great food and great quality for the price especially the sandwiches in particular  The carne sandwich comes with your choice of type of beef and it s delicious and tender and well cooked with tons of flavor  The ciabatta bread soaks in so much wonderful juices and is just tasty  My younger sis got the burger and it was a beast in size    Ordering is kind of chaotic and the menu is super expansive now  Expect a line out the door on Friday dinner time But once you get use to it it s not only convenient but run by such sweet and understanding people  They know how to make your service interesting  All their recommendations hit the spot  Also enjoy the numerous sauce station  They are greatttttt ,5,2016-01-09
Worth the wait in line   Incredible meats and great energized staff  Cannot wait until its warm to eat outside,5,2014-02-24
    stars   Flat out incredible   I drove out of my way about    minutes to find a good place for lunch in Pittsburg and yelp hooked me up big time with this place     Very small place that smells like heaven should smell like   beautiful food fired beef   The ribeye platter was awesome and they season everything so perfectly   Nothing here is lacking flavor   The only reason why I knocked it down to     was the cooking temp of the ribeye   I don t think they cook temp to order  I didn t ask  however  and everything seems to be cooked to med well   If it was cooked to med rare I probably would have asked to sleep on the roof indefinitely    The grilled corn was probably the best corn I ve ever had and the potatoes were phenomenal   big seasoning there too   My wife ordered the turkey sandwich and it really was special too   Everything here is just very high quality and well prepared     Let me say   the best thing possibly about this place are the   sauces they have sitting out that you can put on anything   They are just dynamite   We tried all the sauces on just about everything   It really put the meal over the top      If you are looking for lunch in the area and you go elsewhere you are cheating yourself ,5,2014-07-13
Best steak sandwich anywhere   The pork sandwich is even better   Food  service and atmosphere are all about as good as you can get    Pricing is pretty good too   There is nothing on the menu that I ve tried that hasn t been fabulous   Finally tried the burger here and it is so good you will want to go to every burger place you have ever been to and demand an apology    I used to think burgatory was the benchmark but Gauchos has elevated the burger game to new heights   It s almost unfair to the rest ,5,2015-08-07
Thoroughly unimpressed by this place  possibly due to all of the hype  I for the life of me cannot understand the process for ordering  You wait in line forever  but feel rushed to order because you can only ask questions once you get to the front of the line  And you don t want to be that customer that takes   minutes inquiring about the expansive menu  Everyone will hate you for it  To make things worse  they only have ONE cashier  This establishment should accommodate the vastly growing crowd  But it appears that they want customers to feel like they re dining at an exclusive place  they could make changes but they seem to think they don t need to  There is another guy at the front counter that strictly grabs drinks and uncorks wine bottles  He could be of much more use elsewhere  such as also taking orders  I don t like that you have to tip up front  Personally  I always tip      but when you re forced to grab all of your own eating utensils and seat yourself  I m not sure what service I was tipping for  The cashier also stated that  maybe someone will seat you if you stand at the bottom of the stairs but I don t really know what s going on right now   And when I went upstairs to find a seat the waitress was very rude in accommodating seating for us   We ordered the wings and they did not disappoint  They were flavorful and needed no extra sauces  I got the ribeye platter with a side of corn on the cob and vegetables  I requested medium well steak and basically got medium instead  The guy at the counter stated that the ribeye tasted better as medium or medium rare  so I think they chose to cook my steak as they saw fit  The corn had no seasoning whatsoever  Not worth getting  The vegetables were cooked nicely on the grill  but then they were paired with a sweet sauce that did not complement the dish well  My boyfriend also had the ribeye platter with a side of corn mash and potatoes  A few of his pieces were so burnt that you couldn t even eat them  The potatoes had no seasoning and the mash was just okay    Overall it seemed that other than having the grill flavor  there were no extra seasonings on most of the food  The wings were excellent and that s the only positive I could think from the experience  I agree with others when they say that you want to get your money s worth  I want to feel like I m paying     for a meal and not at a fast food joint  Also  advertise on the website that you have a BYOB policy so that out of towners are aware  The service in general left a bitter taste in my mouth ,2,2016-08-14
The servers told us that they wouldn t take our order until our entire group had arrived  Since the plan was for part of the group not to eat  this made no sense  A different person in the group went up and ordered and we  snuck through their defenses  We got the sandwiches and sat in the back room   we pulled a few chairs together so we could all sit together  The owner   manager came over and took the chairs from our table to put them at an empty table next to us   We took the chairs back and he took them from our table again   We took some chairs from a different table  and for some reason  this seemed ok in his pea brain and he stopped taking the chairs  After this  the food was pretty mundane  I had a steak sandwich that was sliced so thick  it was like eating a steak between two slices of bread  No one at the table was impressed witht he food  and the rude treatment topped it off  No way will we ever go back there   There are lots of other sandwich shops  that are actually happy to take your money   ,1,2017-08-08
Fantastic food coming from a Texan  The Qui Qui Chicken and shrimp was delicious  The customer service is on point  Everything about this place makes me want to fly back to the lame Steelers nation just to eat at this place ,5,2018-06-20
I have heard  read and witnessed raving reviews about Gaucho but every time I drove past the line was way too long for me to wait  Not because I didn t think it was worth it  but mostly becasue when I go eat I am usually already starving to death    Tuesday   pm I ventured to the strip to gather some fresh fruits and veggies and for the first time ever there was no line  I parked nearby and thought to myself  no line  probably closed   Nope  They were open and ready to feed my soul    I walked in  glanced at the enormous menu and asked the kid behind the counter what he recommended  I settled on the carne ribeye steak sandwich  My order was up within a few minutes  The sandwich came wrapped in paper like a butcher would do  I was directed to the sauces    in total  I scooped a small scoop of each in the container and went to the table    The sandwich was excellent  All the sauces were to die for and the steak was just so succulent and cooked to perfection  The only negative thing I can think of was that I was still a bit hungry after the sandwich  I didn t realize it came alone with no sides     I assumed for     It would have come with fries  chips or even a pickle    I will surely go back to gaucho but I will also be sure to order more food so I don t leave hungry next time ,5,2017-06-07
If you are a true meat lover  look no further in Pittsburgh  Make sure to arrive       minutes prior to closing time so as to make sure you will be able to be seated ,5,2017-02-13
great food  people  and atmosphere  If you truly want to enjoy every bit of it i would suggest only going during the week  On the weekend it is just way too busy and if it s your first time it may be a bit confusing and you may not get the full experience ,4,2015-08-11
There is a reason why Gaucho is the top Yelp rated restaurant in PGH  the steak and really everything on the menu is fantastic   Even if you re carb adverse  enjoy one of their sandwiches with chimichurri and enjoy   Oh  and the line that s absolutely going to be out the door is totally worth the wait ,5,2016-03-07
A group of   of us decided to try this for lunch today  The owner was enthusiastic and gave us a great run down of the menu and what everything was  I had the pollo sandwich with pulled chicken  mushrooms  potatoes  and onions on a focaccia type bread  The bread was delcious and the sandwich alone was enough to fill me up  Most of the other people in our group also got sandwiches and also said they were great along with the grilled corn  Someone got a salad and added shrimp to it  She said the shrimp and dressing were delicious  My only complaint observation about this place is that there is very limited seating  There is almost no seating inside  so while it was great to eat on their patio during August  I m not sure how much business they will do in the winter months  I think the food is great and the employees and service was exceptional  I just hope they can find a way to keep it running without seating in the winter ,4,2013-08-23
Certainly lives up to its reputation  Let me answer some questions  there is a wait as you probably already know    BUT the line honestly goes fast  A tip I used was also you could check the general time on google for the time you plan to go  The place is BYOB  dont miss out on that opportunity   If its your first time  I suggest getting the platter with all the different meats so you can decide on your favorite  The chorizo and asado platter are so juicy and flavorful  When we went they kept raving about the toast   but it was not good at all so I do not recommend that  YOU MUST also try all the sauces regardless  Probably note the best place for large groups because of the table setting  Highly recommend this place and I will be back ,5,2018-08-27
Amazing  Worth the wait in line  Everyone is friendly and helpful  I ve loved everything I have had from Gaucho ,5,2017-08-29
amazing  delicious food  new favorite place to eat and definitely a must if you re in Pittsburgh ,5,2017-03-07
Maybe the best restaurant in Pittsburgh  I really can t get enough  No one in the city is doing what they do and I ve never ordered something that wasn t fantastic  Don t get turned off by the wait  it s worth it and moves faster than you d think  make sure to try their empanadas ,5,2018-05-13
As good as advertised  They close at  pm and i was there around   and they still had a line to the door  I ordered the mixed plate and two empanads   definitely a pound of meat  the steak was cooked perfectly and very juicy  chicken the same   The sausage was very tender and had a nice spice to it as well   Must go in Pitt,5,2017-03-16
Come here if you want an overpriced super tough and chewy steak  Not sure if they were just serving crap because they knew a big conference was in town or its the Pittsburgh standard but very unimpressed  I d steer clear regardless   We ordered two ribeyes per the Nirvana loving head bobbing staff   One was medium and other medium rare  It was a battle of sawing through meat fibers and spitting out gristle into the plentiful supply of napkins  No one ever came to ask how are orders were or seemed to care  The sauces condiments on the other hand were quite good and needed to choke down their meat  I think I ve had better steak at outback and I hate that place  Pass pass pass don t go here ever if you like good steak ,1,2018-03-23
I couldn t possibly recommend this place more    In the heart of the Strip District  it s the perfect way to end a day perusing through Pittsburgh s favorite Food District  And it s an ending that will certainly not disappointment    It s an  order at the counter  establishment  which can sometimes lead to a bit of a line backup that leads you outside of the restaurant doors  but for the most part the line moves quicker than you would expect    Whether you are sharing a dish  steak platter or paella   or hand picking some of your personal favorites  you are sure to find something that you will decide you can no longer live without     I m a big fan of the pollo con pan  cauliflower side  and the empanadas    Push the flavor boundaries a bit and experiment with one  or all  of their house side sauces   The Ajo is my favorite ,4,2018-03-15
I had been to Gaucho a few times before they remodeled   The food was always excellent  but there was barely any room to sit   Last night  Saturday  was my first time back at Gaucho since the remodel   The good news is that the food is still amazing and the prices are still the same   Bad news is that the staff did not grow enough along with the renovation  so the service was ridiculously slow and the line to even get in the restaurant was extremely long   My boyfriend and I waited about an hour to even get in the door  about    minutes in line inside the restaurant  and about    minutes after we ordered before we actually got our food   Let me re emphasize that the food was absolutely delicious  but I do not recommend going there on a weekend evening ,4,2015-08-02
It does not get any better for me than a piece of flavorful meat  I had the Carne with Hanger and Flank  My taste buds aren t that sophisticated so I can t tell you what the taste differences are though one was a little more chewy than the other  However that aside my mouth was singing with each bite of the sandwich  I also had to try all of the sauces available  My favorite was the Chimi which had a nice kick  The staff were incredibly friendly and I sat outside in the sun  Credit cards and oh hey diet rootbeer is available too ,5,2014-10-02
I came here after walking around the Strip on a weekday afternoon with a friend  After some Yelping it seemed like this was the place to be   I ve rarely seen so many   star reviews before  and when I arrived  this was around     PM  there was a line outside the door    The place   the restaurant is bigger than it looks on the outside  when you first enter you wait inline and place your order at the counter  You then grab a seat and the food will be brought out to you  The interior feels very hipster chic   there s a giant chalkboard menu  lots of solid wood furnishings  high ceilings  mason jars  iron embellishments    it s well lit and pleasant    The food  I went with the rosemary beef sandwich  DELICIOUS  The ciabatta bread was nicely toasted and the beef was savory  flavorful and decadent  There was a LOT of meat  so I wouldn t recommend it if you are an office worker looking to avoid an afternoon food coma  That said  the meat got a little drier towards the end of the sandwich  This is where the sauces came in handy  There are four restaurant made sauces available for everyone by the cutlery  I sampled all four and they were great sandwich condiments    The service  fantastic  Everyone had a smile on their faces  and eager to help  The woman who brought out our sandwiches went out of her way to introduce us to the sauces and explain    Overall  it was a great experience  I put four instead of five stars just because I wasn t as mind blown by the sandwich as I thought I would be   but overall I would definitely come back  ,4,2015-07-19
Gaucho is so  so good  I ve been there several times and they have failed to disappoint  Although it is Argentinian BBQ  I am a vegetarian and I have never had a problem ordering  Their seafood and veggies are out of this world  THIS PLACE IS A MUST   The employees are also very friendly ,5,2016-07-19
Very solid food for a good price   The sauces are delicious and the meats have great flavor  If I was to complain about anything the sandwiches were almost made with too big slices of bread  Again  a small complaint  It is byob so don t expect to buy drinks here  I will definitely be returning,4,2017-10-14
This is arguably the greatest spot in the city  Everytime someone from out of town comes to visit Pittsburgh  I take them here  Be prepared to wait a long time because this place seemingly always has a long line  My roommate often orders carry out from here to avoid the line but sometimes they re so busy he can t get anyone on the phone to order    This set up is a bit odd  You order and pay at the counter and wait to be seated  Food runners will then bring you your order and fill up your water and collect plates and such  This place is also BYOB    I ve explored the menu quite a bit  My favorite thing to get is the rib eye steak  small portion unless you re sharing  with a side of either the potatoes or the mushrooms  The steak is cooked and seasoned to perfection as it melts in your mouth with the delicious chumichurra sauce  The red potatoes are that perfect level of soft but not too soft and the mushrooms are cooked in this vinegar sauce that is quite unique    If potatoes and mushrooms aren t your thing  they have a few other delicious side options that are all very good  I also recommend getting the steak sandwich  Its huge and I could not finish it in one sitting but it will blow you away  Do not sleep on the beef empanadas either    If you re looking for a more classic restaurant experience  this place also offers a Bodega dining experience that you must book in advance  I believe its    dollars per person and it is a pre fixed menu that explores all the different foods on the menu  Be prepared to eat a lot though because its quite filling  Again its BYOB with free cork service    This place is a must if you re in Pitt and the wait may be long but it is definitely worth it every time  Its amazing to me how this place does so many things so well ,5,2017-06-19
First time to the area so I decided to check this place out  I ordered five things on the menu so I could try their top five dishes  I was not disappointed by any of them    Highly recommended  One negative is the wait  Expect to be seated will take    to    minutes  Worth the wait    Special note  they do take out  They typically cut off phone orders at     ,5,2018-04-29
As difficult as it is to get in here  particularly if you are constrained to a lunch hour  I d like to tell you that it wasn t that special  not worth the wait  I m sorry  it s fabulous  we ll be coming back even with the long lines  The steak is unique to Pittsburgh  different than I ve had anywhere else here  I love the variety of sauces that they encourage you to try  The staff is friendly to the point of being fun  even though they work very hard to service the crush of people  We have been trying for three years to get in here  so waited for a vacation day  came during the week  at       and only waited about    minutes to give our order  We ll be back next time we get a day off ,5,2018-01-26
Great lunch     counter service ordering is a little confusing but steak was great    so was deconstructed sandwich,4,2018-04-07
Wonderful food served by very nice guys who obviously love what they are doing   We went to Gaucho during a weekend visit to Pittsburgh  We wanted to eat at a local place and were interested in meat   we are low carbers so we are always hunting  no pun intended  for good meat places  Gaucho was the first   stars place that Yelp brought up when I put  steak  and it seemed like a non brainer  so we went there and were able to find parking on the street pretty much in front of the restaurant   The place is tiny and pretty simple and nice inside   just my kind of rustic decor  They also have a small patio outside  but being sort of a balmy day  we decided to stay inside  My husband and I shared the asado plate and our son ate the steak sandwich  Everything was delicious  We know really good meat and the one from our asado plate was beyond awesome  They don t have  real  silverware and I was thinking about how we could eat steak with plasticware  Well  the asado comes pre sliced  almost bite sized  so really what you need is your fork  The meat is so tender that you don t even need a good set of teeth   it is really that soft  Their chimichurri was delicious too  it was served as a garnish on top of the meat   Not too garlicky  which I really appreciate  and they put just the right amount of it  I really have a big problem when they put so much of the garnish on the meat that all you can taste is the garnish  Not here   it was really perfect  The same goes for the amount of dressing in the side salad I had  It wasn t drenched in balsamic dressing  which I loved  The greens were fresh and crunchy  and there was just the perfect touch of dressing  And oh  the meat comes with two wonderfully charred browned buttered pieces of toasted ciabatta  I don t eat gluten but it was so beautiful that I had to take a bite  and it was worthy of the stomach pain I felt afterwards  damn gluten     Our son s sandwich was also beautiful and HUGE  It was inside a toasted ciabatta roll and  according to him  it was AWESOME  and if you read any of my other reviews   awesome  is the highest compliment a food can receive     An observation  They were out of a lot of stuff  including cheese  which sounded so incredibly odd to me  as cheese is one of those things that don t spoil too easily so kind of weird that they run out of it  They were also out of empanadas  melon and prosciutto  ribs  and a bunch of other things  The only reasonable explanation I could find is that probably they don t have a lot of fridge space and try to always have fresh ingredients  so since we went on a Saturday  mid afternoon  and they are closed on Sunday and Monday  we probably caught them at the end of their stock  Nevertheless  looks like they can use a good supply chain manager so their inventory management is a better  If I lived in Pittsburg I d volunteer and would gladly receive my salary in steak and salad     ,5,2013-08-05
Wowsa   Totally awesome food  great energy here  Servers so friendly  GM Mikey was so welcoming  engaging  Sauces  meats  food perfectly  freshly made  The  provolone  bread    yum   The smell will bring u in here  BYOB  no corkage  lively environment  Been here twice in a week  Will be a return patron for sure ,5,2015-09-12
All I can say is dayum  This place is awesome  Be sure to bring some patience  you will have to wait  Gaucho s is worth the wait  I was in Pitt for a conference and made a stop after locating the restaurant on yelp  As I stood in line I watched plate after plate pass by and everything looked good  I had the ribeye plate medium well  off the chain      I also had the grilled broccoli and the rusted roots potato s    a must  Sweet potatoes  carrots  onions chopped celery  and I believe chopped red potatoes   This is a must get as well  You have to get the cookies Coates with coconut  I grabbed two to go and a chicken sandwich to go  This place is off the chain    BTW great staff as well    OG is the manager and he will set you straight if you don t know what to order   My co worker had the sirloin and roasted potatoes with smoked garlic  And we both order empanadas to go as well  This place gets a yessss mister ,5,2018-03-24
I am sorry but after much anticipation and high expectations based on all the positive feedback we read I just can t write a good review about our experience here   On a busy Friday evening we waited in line a half hour and my wife ordered the flank steak and I ordered the ribeye   We also ordered the clam  mussel and squid appetizer   Both steaks came out barely warm  almost cold and the appetizer was scalding hot  way too hot to eat clams or mussels   The taste wasn t bad but it was hard to judge because of the missed temperatures   Another uneasy moment happened in the kitchen which is easily visible when ordering your food   One of the chefs exited the cooler with a tray of the salad that is served with many of the meals   There was another tray of raw foods in a dirty container laid on top of the greens   He shouted out  who did this    And the entire staff started pointing fingers at one another   That should have been our cue to leave   Kitchen cleanliness is no laughing matter   I would bet our bad experience was due to how busy they were but it will be our first and last visit ,2,2016-04-29
The food was pretty good  If I was to go again I would call for take out and just pick it up instead of waiting in line,4,2018-02-05
One word  YUM  Bring a bottle of wine and come here  The food is FABULOUS ,5,2017-10-17
this place is awesome  go there so they will stay in business and I can continue eating delicious steak for a long time ,5,2014-02-25
