Great food  great service  great vibes  Happy to have you in Ahwatukee  Snooze  New  pancake of the day  everyday and lots of great weekend brunch drinks  OMG french toast is seriously O M G  ,5,2017-10-13
Oh sahhh  dude     The pineapple upside down pancakes are to die for    Thanks for the awesome breakfast and I m sure I ll be back for cakes and caps in a hop  skip  and a jump   ,5,2017-10-13
Well that was disappointing  Expensive for what you get      for a small side salad that had little of anything in it  A couple of purple carrot strips and some walnuts  Whee    I had a Rueben sandwich for about      Again  not bad but nothing special  Should have gone next door to Modern Market ,1,2017-10-14
What a fun place  Great decor  fun menu and even a full bar with multiple mimosa options and cafe cocktail  Not your typical breakfast only restaurant  I am just happy being here    I managed to get a healthy egg white with veggies omelette and a fresh OJ  But next time I will be more adventurous ,5,2017-10-14
We are thrilled to have a Snooze so close to home  Try the pumpkin spice pancakes  Yum ,5,2017-10-14
Pros  The service was good   Our family tried a variety of food  Loved the Mayan mocha  hash browns  pineapple upside down pancake  and steak Benedict    Cons  We sat on the patio and the music was too loud   Pancakes were a bit over sweet     Staff is hardworking and sincere  They look like they love their jobs which says a lot about management  Looking forward to our next visit   ,4,2017-10-15
Chili verde pork eggs Benedict was superb  as was the service  I love good music in an eatery  however  don t know if we will be back  The music was so loud that we found ourselves  all   of us  yelling at each other in order to have a conversation  Mentioned it when we arrived and they offered outside seating  which didn t help  Someone else must have complained bc just as we were checking out the music was turned down so that you could chat ,3,2017-10-15
My friend and I had brunch here today and had the good fortune of having Hyatt  yes  like the hotel chain  as our server  She was delightful   Be sure to ask for her when you arrive  She was friendly  efficient and full of life and positive vibes  Try the eggs Benedict or breakfast burrito  You won t be disappointed ,5,2017-10-17
Great breakfast place  Their pancake flight is fun if a bit decadent  Try the OMG French Toast as one of the   choices  It works well to share as an appetizer ,5,2017-10-18
Amazing food at a great price  The benedicts are amazing and the pancakes are out of this world  There is no breakfast place around that compares ,5,2017-10-18
I had lunch with a friend  and Hyatt was our server   First  Hyatt is absolutely awesome   She is attentive  caring  efficient  and really knows the menu and what to suggest   She also asked us about allergies  and since I have a major allergy  I really appreciated it   Thank You  Hyatt  for making my day   Second  the food is AMAZING   I had the Benedict Duo  and loved every bite   The food was hot  fresh  expertly plated  and portion sizes were perfect   I will definitely be returning to this restaurant   Thank You  Thank You  Thank You ,5,2017-10-18
Best Hash browns I have ever eaten at a breakfast place  HANDS Down  I eat the hash browns like twice a month  Lol,5,2017-10-19
Today was the first time eating here and I will      be back   The staff was very nice and on top of things   There was always someone walking by your table willing to help and the best part is you didn t feel as if it was a bother to them to help one another   I had a regular cup of coffee and it was perfect  not to weak or strong   I had the Bella  Bella  Benny and omg  it was was amazing   Try it  you won t regret it   My husband has The B E A T Sandwich and I got to try a bite   It was really good and he enjoyed it as well   We already have our next visit planned ,5,2017-10-20
It s hard to pick which is better the food  the drinks or the service  Everything on the menu far exceeds expectations and the staff is by far the friendliest in town  Guaranteed you ll leave satisfied  happy and feeling great ,5,2017-10-20
Amazing food and even better service  I was very excited to this opening and was immediately treated as if  everyday is my bday    star experience for any and all breakfast endeavors,5,2017-10-27
Definitely worth the wait to get in  and they have a great texting service that lets you wander around nearby shops while you wait   The staff is incredibly attentive and quick but it never seems rushed  The food was excellent    I got the Benedict duo  bella bella benny and chili verde   both of which were wonderful  The hash browns were divine and make sure whatever you get comes with a side of hash browns  Huge high recommendation  The menu was very varied and I wanted to try a million things  Absolutely will make a return trip ,5,2017-10-28
Best Eggs Benedict ever   And I normally don t eat hashbrowns but these were so favorable   I can t wait to come back and try their Bloody Mary s   Just come early   I arrived at      and sat at the counter   By      there was a wait list ,4,2017-10-29
Everything I ve tried at this place is delicious and is decently priced  They can also make almost anything gluten free  Service has been excellent every time I ve been here ,5,2017-10-29
I was thrilled to find they opened a location near my niece s home   We tried them for lunch  and as usual  the service was amazing  the venue light and airy    My niece was torn between the ham benedict and the pineapple upside down pancake   imagine her delight when she found you could substitute a pancake for the potatoes     I tried the Rueben sandwich and the corn beef was moist and downright yummy   This was the first time that I found the potato casserole to be spiced not to my liking   I couldn t quite identify what it was    Next time  I will substitute a side salad     Definitely back on my list ,5,2017-10-29
The service  was A  all due to Hayatt  She kept out drinks filled   Very knowledgeable about the menu  It was a good time  We will definitely be coming back ,5,2017-10-29
Before anything  the service was exceptional  The estimated wait time at prime time Brunch was about an hour  but it came out to    minutes  They have a text system that ll tell you your table is ready  so I did some grocery shopping in between  and held a table for my party when we came back    The food was excellent  the blueberry Danish pancakes came with pancakes of a formidable size  I paired it with a mm mm mimosa  quite delicious  Wife had the BEAT sandwich  just as delicious   The kids portions were very generous  looked big enough for an adult  The eggs were a bit bland though ,4,2017-10-29
DO  NOT  COME  HERE  ON  THE  WEEKEND  I made the mistake of strolling up to this location at   am on a Sunday and was BLOWN AWAY  There was a line going right into the street and it was chaos  I heard a lot about Snooze but had no idea it was THIS popular  I came here with a friend for a birthday brunch and we waited about    minutes for a table  They have a text notification system to let you know when your table was ready   but it didn t work for us  Anywho  when we finally were seated it was on the patio which was great because of the nice weather  Dogs are allowed out on the patio and that was nice too since I like dogs  but unfortunately don t have any   The service was great  and the food was FANTASTIC  Try the OMG French Toast and Mimosas  they re game changers  I really enjoyed the place overall and had a great time  Just make sure to call ahead and be ready to claim your seat   or someone else will ,5,2017-10-30
I have always been a fan of Snooze but this location is so much better than all the rest   Snooze is the happening place for brunch that brings a twist on traditional breakfast staples and adds a retro flair to it s decor  From the eggs Benedict that takes a twist to incorporate lox with caper relish to a sausage gravy stuffed pot pie  there is something for everyone   We went here on Saturday and hour before they were closing  They were quick to help us and put our names down  They use a texting system to help alert you once your table is ready  They placed a few chairs outside to sit and wait  in which we only waited    minutes which is an all time record for us when we go to Snooze    Let me tell you the pros of this location    Tons of free parking  Thats right  No meters  and lots of free space to park  sign me up    The inside is huge  many other locations are confined by smaller buildings but this location was large and offered tons of booths for patrons to sit at    Quick staff  the fastest service I have ever received at a Snooze   The staff was friendly and took care of us right away  I ordered the pot pie which used a flaky pastry crust  stuffed with country gravy  sausage and you typical pot pie fix ins  The top was adorned with an egg that I ordered over Easy  Instead of hash browns  I ordered the pancake instead for a   dollar up charge  The best part  you can get any pancake  so I ordered the Pumpkin bourbon pancake and oh my goodness  it was perfection  The pancake had a sweet butter on top  with a cream cheese type of sauce drizzle along with bourbon syrup and tons of yummy nuts  My husband and I split this because it was huge  We loved it  Too bad it s seasonal  so get it while you can  My pastry was amazing  the flavors somehow blended perfectly and was not too heavy  I d highly recommend if you want something different  Lastly my husband ordered the lox Eggs Benedict  I love the caper relish they put on top and the sauce is delicious   We received our food in    minutes from ordering which was fantastic as I was starving  Overall  this location is definitely my favorite  The decor is a little more bland but this place knows how to move fast and make amazing food every time  Hope to see you at Brunch ,5,2017-10-30
I ve enjoyed the food at   of their locations now and haven t been disappointed   Most recently I tried the Benny Goodman since I adore Benedict s  I absolutely loved it   Two poached eggs were served on toasted dark rye with lox   a sun dried tomato and caper relish  this was one of the most unique Benedict dishes I ve tasted so far  Hollandaise included cream cheese so perfectly enhanced the lox  The entree is completed by hash browns which were beautifully crisp on the outside   Loved sitting on the patio     no on a weekday morning ,4,2017-11-04
They can t handle a Saturday crowd  Our    minute wait turned into    minutes even though they had    open tables on the patio and     tables inside  Restaurant was half empty  and when we asked if they were short staffed  they claimed they weren t  Food is good   creative dishes   but coffee is awful ,3,2017-11-04
My second time coming here and it was wonderful   Line was long but it went fast and they texted me when my table was ready    Food is fabulous   Customer service is         Atmosphere is family friendly    stop for the best breakfast and customer service    My kids asked when we could go back   ,5,2017-11-05
Who doesn t love snooze   Either in the morning when you hit your alarm  or to eat at     The lines are long    for a reason  It has very good breakfast items    with a more high class twist  The breakfast burrito is a fave    with the green Chile sauce  Add some bacon   and I do light on the black beans   and you have perfection    And part of the secret is to call your order in   take it home or to a nice park to enjoy  Skip the line ,5,2017-11-05
You can never go wrong with a Snooze breakfast  Unless half your breakfast doesn t show up until everyone you re spending your Sunday Brunch with is done eating  Only saw our waitress when she took our order  I understand it s busy but when we asked about the rest of the order she s says  oh yeah   Doesn t apologize  Doesn t even try to speed up getting the order out  It was one pancake  Nothing special  just one   Four stars are definitely for the food only  Customer service was a solid     stars ,4,2017-11-05
I can t figure out why the reviews are good for this place   The food is SALTY   The service is slow and apathetic   Sure  it looks cool   funky inside  but I prefer palatable good and friendly service ,2,2017-11-08
The Bangkok Bloody Mary is hands down the best Bloody Mary I ve ever had  They make their own pickles for garnish and I would buy them in a jar if they d sell them  OMG French Toast was awesome too  Great food   Minus a star for ambiance  It was crazy loud  So loud my husband   I couldn t have a conversation across the table  Also  it was packed so we knew food wouldn t be out instantly but it was pretty slow  about       min from ordering to food  Other people seem to have had amazing service but ours was lack luster  nice enough waitress but when we ran out of drinks we had to search for her to order another ,4,2017-11-11
Went for a nice Saturday breakfast wi my wife   I had the single worst experience at a restaurant ever  After waiting for what seemed forever  we finally just sit at the bar  We place our order we waited and waited the waitresses said   times you order will be right up  All of a sudden we look at the clock and realized we have been waiting   hours  The waitress could not find it in the system  which means the waitress did not put in the order  So  we waited two hours to be lied to and left hungry  We were not even any sort of a coupon for a future visit  I will NEVER go back,1,2017-11-12
Went here on a Friday morning  It was really busy  kids were out of school for Veterans Day   My friend and I put our name on the waiting list  Hostess said it would be       minutes   We drank coffee from the complimentary station setup at entrance    We received a text    minutes later saying the table was ready  The environment is nice and decor is modern with lots of orange      Our waitress was really nice and helpful  My friend got the shrimp and grits while I opted for the egg white omelet with bacon  cheese  peppers  and pico de Gallo with an English muffin with strawberry jelly  My friend also ordered a mimosa   The waitress recommended the Fallin and my bestie really liked it   I tasted my friend shrimp and it was really good and flavorful   reminds me of New Orleans BBQ Shrimp    It was really good   My dish was good also   bacon makes everything right    Also the jelly was really  Good    I think this is going to be my new favorite breakfast spot in Chandler when visiting my family   ,5,2017-11-12
Needs some work  Menu is very unique and variety is great  People friendly  Taking orders very efficient  Food service needs work  Food coming out warm to cool  Had to return an item  Bacon crispness not consistent ,3,2017-11-12
Very popular and for good reason   Excellent food   Be prepared to wait but it s worth it   Good menu   Service was ultra friendly   Cool eclectic decor   They have free coffee while you wait which is a bonus in my book   For a scramble and it was fantastic ,5,2017-11-15
The energy and ambiance of this place is perfect for brunch  Snooze eatery has mastered the eggs Benedict  and the pancakes are simply the best  The staff was friendly and the food came out fast  This is one of my favorite spots to bring family from out of town ,5,2017-11-16
This restaurant wasn t very hard to become a regular at  I come atleast once a week for over a month now  The brewmosas are delicious and I ve tried almost everything on the menu and nothing ever seems to disappoint  Treat yourself to a flight of pancakes  That wrong will always feel right  Great staff that always make you feel welcome  Love the snoozers  especially KC  ,5,2017-11-17
Since it s opening there s been a line out the door   Fun atmosphere and good service but I was disappointed w the food and the coffee     We had the breakfast pot pie  sausage was tasty but there just wasn t enough of it so it was just bland and the Bella Bella Benny  poached eggs were done to perfection and the hollandaise sauce was out of this world   Surprisingly the coffee was pretty ordinary and weak   Hip places like this typically have amazing coffee   I will give this place another try and if I don t like my food choice again I ll just have a mimosa to make it all better ,3,2017-11-18
The food was good   the pancake of the day  candied bacon  was amazing    the only negative thing I can say is that the service could be a little better   we went there when they opened so there weren t a lot of people yet but our food could have been hotter along with the hot chocolate it seemed like it was sitting at the counter for a lil bit   and our waitress could have checked on us a little more  other then that we enjoyed our food here ,4,2017-11-18
Well it s  am and here we are at a very crowed Snooze  Came with my daughter and hubby for breakfast   Ali has eaten at Snooze lots in San Diego and got us up early to drive    miles to get here  Oh my goodness  Clean and bright  with a very friendly hostess who sat us right away  We must of had lots of  luck that day because the people who came after us had to wait and when we left the line was about    people long  Our waiter  Chris   I think that s his name short little guy of       was at our table in less than   minutes   He was wonderful  explained the menu and answered our questions  Coffee came next  Hot and delicious  Okay the food   I had the pineapple upside down pancakes  Best pancake I ever had   I want to go back soon the only problem is that because this resturant has such a following I need to get up at ungodly hour to get there early ,5,2017-11-19
This is my second time coming  I can see why this place stays busy  The hollandaise is one of the most popular dish  I thought what the heck its my birthday I will give it a try  I got the bene duo  Great portion for the entree  The food was delicious  The downside was the wait and service was slow  I would definitely come again though ,4,2017-11-19
    stars for now  Finally hit up Snooze at their new location in Ahwatukee and had an okay experience  Food was pretty good but the service I received felt fake and passive aggressive   I ordered the breakfast burrito which had good flavors but wasn t served hot enough for my liking  The middle was just barely warm which took away from the flavors a bit  It comes with no meat by default  other than eggs of course   and costs about    to add a protein of your choice   With a ton of boozy brunch drinks and creative dishes available  Snooze is a decent spot for basic brunching  However  after my experience with the literally lukewarm food and service  not sure if I d be back again too soon ,3,2017-11-20
First the good   The menu is outrageous with lots of yummy choices  All brunch places should have mimosas and this one has practically a full bar   The Eggs Benedict is outstanding  It was perfectly cooked and the  Best I have ever had at a restaurant  and I am hard to please on this dish   The coffee is also very flavorful  Now  the less good  Tuesday morning       and it still took over     hour to get our food  The coffee took  over    minutes  The noise level inside the restaurant was high    And now the real  disappointment  I tried a side of pancake  I consider myself a pancake aficionado  The pancake was woefully  Under cooked and very doughy  no light and fluffy about it  inedible  Too bad customer service was not on this issue   I wasn t offered  another pancake  after I showed them or an adjustment on the bill   In fact  the waitress didn t seem to care  So  don t expect fast service  avoid the pancakes  and ask for quick coffee  I will go back and try again  in case they improve with the feedback I see they are getting ,3,2017-11-21
I rarely write reviews unless I get exceptionally good food or service  or both   Snooze continues to do both  My son and I were introduced to Snooze a few years ago in Colorado and had a good experience but since they came to AZ we go here     times a week  We always get great service here and the food   which is trendy standard breakfast fare but done very well  I d also point out the staff is able to be unusually professional and friendly at the same time  We often get served at the new Ahwatukee location by Hayatt and she does an even more outstanding job of making sure we re well taken care of without being overbearing in the least  Great job Snooze  Keep it up ,5,2017-11-24
This place has pretty good breakfast foods  But today I went in with a friend of mine and our server had the worst attitude  She didn t introduce herself and she had this look on her face like she didn t want to be there  She also took my ketchup when I wasn t even done with it to top it off she didn t even ask if she can take it she just reached right over my face WITHOUT SAYING EXCUSE ME and took it then walked away  How rude  While I was eating NOT EVEM DONE she starts taking my plate and I was like I m not even done  Like wow she really wanted us gone  I really hope you guys address this problem  If she has poor customer service skills she shouldn t be working at a place like this   Her name was Kayla by the way ,1,2017-11-26
Brunch restaurants are overrated and this place is another example of why  A party of two waited    minutes to be seated     more minutes to get food  and    minutes to get the check  The food is good but definitely not worth the three hour wait ,3,2017-11-26
First time   snooze great food   excellent service  Menu has variety and our server was great  Eggs Benedict yum and next time mimosas ,5,2017-12-02
Way over priced when your drink is almost half the cost of your meal  Good food and that would be the only reason I would ever come back  Hostesses allowed people to wait outside while having a good time messing around and laughing up at the counter  meanwhile leaving approximately   tables booths open at all times  My first time visit was disappointing ,3,2017-12-02
   adults walked away from this location this morning  I arrived at       and checked in with the hostess   The manager who was seating people had NO clue as to what he was doing   We wanted to sit together and when a couple tables would leave the manager would reseat them  I went up several times to ask about our tables and the wait always seemed to get longer   After over an hour and the resturant was full again we left   Time to retrain or continue to loss customers    The manager did t just  snooze he passed out   They got one star only because the hostess where very nice ,1,2017-12-02
This is the fourth time ive been to snooze and I love it  The food is great waiters r nice Totally love that u r on Ray Rd which is closer than Tempe don t change and of course ill be back,5,2017-12-06
Have eaten here a number of times  Every time without fail the egg offerings come out at near room temperature  cold   It seems as if they cook eggs first  and leave them on the plate to cool while they cook the rest  The food is usually tasty  but always cold  They have a problem with timing ,2,2017-12-09
I was just in the area so I decided to stop for A bite  I have heard really good things about this place but I didn t think it was as good as the things I ve heard  It was a very cool set up with many booths and tables with chairs  We waited for about       minutes for a seat with the place being pretty full  mine as well we had   in our party  Snooze has a really great menu and many choices to choose from  and also have some unique flavors for pancakes  I got a green Chile burrito with black beans  egg And cheese  It was a good burrito but my one downside is that the burrito was pretty cold  and everything inside of it was cold too  We also got pumpkin pancakes  a sausage biscuit type thing  and French toast  These were all very good  The service was also Good  If you were to want to go somewhere for a quick breakfast place I would recommend it,3,2017-12-09
I ve tried to find a reason to dislike this place just to help me from not being a regular and  I have Nothing ugh   This place is amazing  fresh fruit  very tasty drinks and the pancake of the day is never the same  If you can t make up your mind about which pancake to order just choice three different kind and call it a day   customer service is wonderful  everyone is friendly and welcoming  Super clean  Would I tell a friend or two  You betcha    already have LoL ,5,2017-12-11
Came here on a Sunday for brunch to celebrate my friends   st bday and had a blast  We were told it was about a       minute wait time  but only waited    minutes which was perfect  However while we waited we sat at the bar and ordered some tasty  overpriced  mimosas  The bartender was super friendly and fast  but because we weren t eating food they asked us if we could move to the side for those that wanted to eat and sit at the bar  I also loved that they texted me to let me know our table was ready it was super convenient  The hostess Brooklyn was very friendly which made the experience even better  The food was delicious and i think the prices were very reasonable for the food  They went above and beyond and brought out a pancake with candles for my friends bday and sang happy birthday ,5,2017-12-11
This location is not quite up to par with others in the area  My friend and I both ordered bacon  and were asked if we wanted it crispy  We both responded  yes   but hers came out burnt and mine was undercooked and greasy  It s a breakfast restaurant  so good bacon is something I would expect  I ll continue to go to the Snooze locations in Tempe and Gilbert ,3,2017-12-16
Went for breakfast this AM with the family  They were busy  but the wait wasn t long for a table  Off to a slow start at the table since they were busy  but once our server got there she was on top of it and food came out quick  The menu is full of things you ll want to try making it hard to choose what to get  a good problem to have   The food was good  but no standout wow factor  just good but not great  That being said we are likely to come back and try some of the other menu items  Today I had the covered snooze spuds deluxe good  Husband had the tofu scramble and didn t care for the texture  soggy   Daughter had French toast which was good  See pictures  Decor is cute and they have a nice patio area ,3,2017-12-16
This place just gets better every time  Different menu with flavorful choices  Not your typical breakfast place  This one has choices you ve never dreamed of  Chili Verde Benes   Yum   Expect a wait  min    mins  but they ll text you when your table is ready  so put your name in and do a little shopping nearby ,5,2017-12-17
I had really high expectations of this new location  seeing as all the other Snooze Cafe s I have been to  have been  TO DIE FOR  this one    definitely won t be back  Coffee was SUPER bitter  their hot chocolate tasted like hot milk with no cocoa flavor  Ordered Breakfast Pot Pie and a Sweet Potato Pancake  the pie was cold  like it had been sitting out for a good period of time before getting to the table  The pancake was VERY unimpressive  Had maybe   pecans  a SMALL amount of caramel drizzle and an AWFUL aftertaste that I just couldn t get past  this along with the Hot Milk   bitter coffee were sent back  I ate the Breakfast Pot Pie  because honestly I didn t want to wait   really disappointed with this new location  We had originally found this place in Colorado and were excited when we heard there were locations in AZ ,2,2017-12-17
Went here last Sun           Server was Hyatt  she was nice  attentive and funny  We both had breakfast  I had what was  equivelent to biskets an gravey but on a cresaint  eggs over medium  hash browns cake and side sausage patty  Wife had a mix of eggs benedict   You can get two different ones with one meal  To top it off she suggested we get a pancake  pineapple upsidedown  This was excellent  Food was really good  coffee was a specialty blend and tasty  Overall wait time  they txt you   service and food were very good    negitave is prepare to talk loud the place had no ceiling insulation and is very noisy  Always like having another breakfast place in Ahwatukee  since this is where the MiMi s was ,4,2017-12-20
Went on Sunday morning so as expected  we had about a    minute wait   Love that they offer coffee while you wait   one suggestion  have somebody in charge of the station so things stay full   We initially came up to an empty coffee pot and empty creamer container but things were refilled immediately upon saying something   Love the interior  very chic   We were served by Hayatt  who is efficient but running  running  running   Took a few minutes to get her to warm up but once she did  she was personable and even gave us hugs when we were leaving     I had a side  plain pancake and an omelet with spinach  mushrooms  and jack cheese   Partner had the Snooze Classic with the pulled pork   OMG   the pork was fabulous   We loved the flavor of it   The potatoes are great too  although next time we will ask for a bit more crispy     Overall  a   star experience   We even had a visit with the General Manager who stopped by   Yes   most likely you will have a wait when going but so worth it     Can t wait to try other things on the menu ,5,2017-12-20
Updating   Management contacted us about our problems   We have been back several times and service is much better    Worst Snooze  Inattentive slow staff   Food is good but diner shouldn t have to retrieve their own cream   Better to drive few miles for better service ,5,2017-12-26
Great place for breakfast or brunch since it is not open evenings and has no lunch items to speak of on menu We waited    for a table Place is well decorated lively and a sort of   s theme Clean and service is very friendly They are very willing to cater to your food needs and make changes to menu items Staff knows the food and menus very well Food was beautifully presented and delicious  Would definitely come again  Maybe for the French toast with caramel sauce and berries as a sweet treat early afternoon ,5,2017-12-27
Waited    minutes for a table with an empty patio and watched a lot of people get seated before us  then we were told it d be  at least ten more minutes   Apparently the  kitchen  was  overwhelmed as of an hour ago    You d think that after the holidays someone would have the foresight to maybe schedule more kitchen staff     I won t bother coming back ,1,2017-12-27
Great restaurant with amazing food and drinks  The wait was a bit long but the service made up for it  Our server  Rachel K  was attentive and friendly  She made sure our visit was a pleasant one  I ordered the Benny Goodman and it was to die for  We also ordered a few pancakes for the table that were devoured  Overall  extremely happy with the new locationa and will definitely be coming back ,5,2017-12-28
The wait times are ridiculous  We waited over    mins to get seated  And once we got seated and waited another     mins to get our food  I would recommend having a small bite before coming here  The only downside is the wait times  The breakfast is pretty good ,2,2017-12-28
   min wait to be seated no big deal   Once seated waited a hour to get our food   Waiter only came once during that time to apologize   Food was good but not worth the wait   Waiter never even came back and gave us our check   Another waitress came by and took my card,1,2017-12-29
I would give     stars if possible  Food is fine  service is decent  but they can be misleading about their pricing and how they charge you    For some of the dishes  you choose your add ins  and anything additional would be charged extra  However  we were told by the manager that their system  automatically charges you for the more expensive item  instead of including that as part of your original add in  Add a      veggie and they ll instead charge you for the       meat instead  Their receipts are vague so it s not explicitly written on there for what you ve been upcharged   This is the second time we ve had to argue about this  Keep track of what your total amount should be before they give you the receipt  They ll refund you as  pickle    but will tell you they ll  only do it this once   I asked for this to be written on the menu so customers aren t misled  but they weren t very responsive to the idea ,3,2018-01-01
Always one of my most favorite breakfast spots  When I saw they were opening near my home  over the moon excited  Sweet potato pancake is to die for  And the Bangkok blood just perfect ,5,2018-01-02
We have given this place several opportunities and have been disappointed every time  Slow service  cold food  undercooked food and have had our order completely wrong  Disappointing  Love a good breakfast ,2,2018-01-04
Great food and great service  fun menu to boot ,5,2018-01-05
First time at Snooze and having heard great things for a hip brunch location  I was quite excited  The wait took about    minutes for a busy Saturday morning  The staff was extremely friendly and although the wait was a bit long and they forgot a side of hash browns  the service and food was customizable and delicious  Will be back again ,4,2018-01-06
Just tried the new Snooze in Ahwatukee and can t wait to go back  I ordered the  Sandwich I Am  which was probably the greatest breakfast sandwich I ve ever eaten  It has scrambled eggs  a thick piece of sausage  cheese  and comes in a pretzel bun  Then you dip it in a side of smoked cheddar hollandaise sauce that was by far the best I ve ever had  This place has long lines and service is ok  but we will go back for the fantastic food ,5,2018-01-06
I have been here twice since the grand opening and twice ordered the same breakfast because don t fix what s not broke   amiright    Order the green chili Benedict because it has a spicy hollandaise sauce that you have never tried before anywhere else  My dad order the pineapple upside down pancakes which looked amaze ,5,2018-01-09
       You Snooze you lose  At least that s what I thought when we left here around   ish and there were already people waiting outside for a table  It wasn t too busy around  ish when we got here though  there were plenty of tables available    The interior is very retro  There s lots of orange and avocado green  with decor and menu design that harkens back to the    s  The menu is very modern though  and I love how there s a little bit of everything for any type of appetite  Want something sweet  There s a lot of delicious pancake options  Want something lighter  There s a special section for healthier fare  Want a traditional breakfast  They have that too  I also really liked how there are multiple vegetarian and vegan options  and that any scramble can be made vegan by substituting tofu    I started off with a latte with almond milk  It had a nice foamy layer with pretty latte art  The coffee was decent  although it did have a slight sour tinge to it    After reading the description for it I knew I had to get the egg white frittata  It had wild mushrooms  garlic and roasted sweet potatoes topped with dressed arugula  cherry tomatoes  spiced pepitas  roasted corn salsa and shaved manchego  That s quite a lot of ingredients  and delicious ones to boot  There are no other sides that go with this dish  only the frittata  It was a good sized circle of egg white with a beautiful bounty of vegetables on top  I loved the different flavors and textures in each bite  The eggs themselves were light and fluffy  you can tell they did a great job whipping the egg whites to get them that nice ethereal texture  I didn t miss the yolk at all in this dish  If you want a little heat in your dish  they offer Cholula  Tabasco hot sauces  There might be another brand but I forgot which one it was   The Cholula comes in red or green  I ve never seen green Cholula before  what a jalapeno revelation   My friend who I ate with asked our server if she could have the same frittata  but with full egg instead of just egg white  The server wasn t sure and she didn t seem very eager to try to find out if the kitchen could offer this  I don t really see why they wouldn t be able to make a regular frittata and I m not sure why they don t also offer this as a regular egg option  I ve had plenty of egg white yolk frittatas and they ve come out fine  She ended up getting something similar  a regular scramble  with some of the same ingredients as the frittata   I did feel like the price was a bit hefty for what we got  The latte was        and with almond milk an extra charge on top of that  For about the same price I can get a really good latte from one of my favorite coffee shops  and the frittata was also a little pricey for my tastes since I only received a single frittata with no other accompaniments included  Quite honestly I was still hungry after eating my meal  I don t doubt that they use high quality ingredients for the breakfast dishes though  and I do know that part of the proceeds goes towards giving back to the community     of sales     As for the noise level  I didn t really feel like it was a very relaxing place to have breakfast or brunch  As more people came in to eat  it got really noisy and the music is more fast paced and also a bit loud so towards the end of my meal it was hard to converse with my friend without straining my ears or saying  What   a few times   I did see a nice little patio area that is dog friendly  I d love to go back with the pups and have a nice breakfast or brunch on that patio sometime ,3,2018-01-13
My friend Katie and I came here for a well deserved brunch after hiking South Mountain with our two puppies  I love that their patio is huge and so dog friendly  Our server was super attentive and immediately brought out bowls of cold water for our spoiled little fur babies  which was a huge plus  I started with the Mountain Mule   gin  grapefruit  ginger beer  lime and agave   which was refreshing and delicious  I absolutely LOVED the I Like You E Lote Benedict  Instead of english muffins  they came on these amazing sweet corn and quinoa cakes and were topped with chili lime hollandaise  You can t really go wrong with any of their bennys  though  and if you re REALLY indecisive there s the option of getting a benny duo  The hash browns here are just meh    but you can upgrade to one of their signature pancakes for only     My favorites are the sweet potato pancakes with caramel and candied pecans  and the blueberry danish pancakes which come with the most amazing lemon cream cheese filling  For those of you looking for something seriously decadent to fill your cheat day  you can also get a flight of   pancakes  You re welcome ,5,2018-01-13
So the food was good   Unfortunately  it stops there  this is where the   stars come from   Considering people have been raving about this place  I really expected good food  good service  and a great environment   The food was good   I had the pancake flight and   well  genius  I loved the variety   Now  admittedly we walked in having all crawled out of bed on the holiday today   Fortunately  we didn t have a wait and we were seated right away since it was about an hour before closing   Unlike my motley group  our server Sydni was very presentable   Unfortunately  she was also somewhat inattentive  forgetful  and a little awkward  e g  I asked about getting some syrup for my pancakes and she replied  not normally    she did bring it  but she forgot for the first while and I was already     done my food once it arrived   she asked us early on if we wanted ketchup and hot sauce and we said  yes  but then she never brought them        Now here s what seals the deal on us not returning  two issues here   Firstly  When we came in  the music was so loud it was actually uncomfortable   We were seated next to a large group of     people  including kids  and between the table next to us and the music   we couldn t actually hear one another speaking   People in the restaurant were clearly all competing with the music and it really escalated the noise level in there   Secondly  the drinks here are problematic   My daughter asked about getting Sprite and was told that they don t have any but they do have a Mexican version   Ok  she didn t want that so she said  can I just get a Coke then    She was brought the Mexican version still and didn t like it  she barely even took a sip out of it   Then  I asked for a diet Coke and was brought a cup full of ice with about   ml of soda poured over it to generate some watery tasteless liquid   Three sips and it was gone   Refill was much the same  another three sips   When I asked for a third  I was told I would be charged again   So I paid    for about        ml of watered down generic soda   In a world of free refills   this has me eating at the competition   Further  Sydni needed some prompting on providing us straws   Oh and the water refills   You d think she was paying out of pocket for the water  those cups sat empty for most of our meal   So Snooze   between the soda situation  the noise  and poor service   I m headed back to my regular breakfast haunt up on Elliott near Priest   You know the one   When you start to hire based on experience and ability  resolve the refill issue  or at least stop padding your drinks with all ice   and turn down the music   let me know  because your food is genuinely good and I really want to like you ,3,2018-01-15
Menu is great with tons of variety and food was good  They can improve the hashbrowns  they were good but bland  Coffee was disappointing  we tried the Latte and a cold brew  both were mediocre  It is not flavorful  a bit bitter and for a breakfast restaurant that s known for their breakfast and mimosas  they are not known at all for their coffee  Although  we will be back  its a great menu and food is good ,4,2018-01-16
They have the best eggs Benedict and their variety always draws us back  They are kid friendly and if you go on weekdays  there is no wait time  from what we experienced   Good quality espresso drinks  too  We love trying  pancake of the day    it s always a surprise in the flavor combinations in a pancake  like jalape o and bacon inside   My husband loves their fresh housemade jelly to put on bread and their alcoholic beverages  I love that for a lot of dishes you can do a combo to try more than one dish  but in smaller quantities ,5,2018-01-18
My favorite breakfast spot got even better today   Sydney waited on us and she is the best waitress EVER   Got our order spot on and repeated it all back   Was very attentive checking in on us the right number of times  Very helpful with everything we requested  and made the whole experience enjoyable ,5,2018-01-21
Our first experience at Snooze was this new location shortly after it opened several months ago  I had heard good things about the food and love a good breakfast place  so was super excited to have one open near our house  The first time we went out server was not great  The restaurant was busy  but he never even came over to our table until we had to ask the hostess where he was  Even after that  he was pretty absent and we had to ask repeatedly for things like drink refills  condiments  etc  I am giving Snooze   stars partly because the food was pretty good  but more importantly because one of the other wait staff  Sydni  was very friendly and helpful  even though we weren t sitting at her table  She went out of her way to come visit with our baby  refill our waters when she saw they were empty  and basically make up for the lack of service from the other employee  Since that visit  we have been back and had a better experience  but we definitely would not have been back a second time if it were not for her ,4,2018-01-22
This is always one of my favorite breakfast spots  Menu isn t huge  but everything is delicious  Everything from their classic breakfast  omelets  sandwiches to the  many  Benedict options is worth ordering  They do get pretty busy  but it s always worth the wait    Always ask for a side of green chile ,5,2018-01-24
Pros   The food is always very good  those hashbrowns    There is a lot of energy in the restaurant on a weekend   The free coffee while you wait for a table    Needs work   On the weekend it s just people spilling into the parking lot and sitting on curbs   They can improve that system   The service has been spotty in my visits  The drink prices are quite steep for a breakfast lunch place     In the end a great addition to Ahwatukee and the best Snooze location I ve been to ,4,2018-01-29
I like it and would go again even if it was date night  Staff was really friendly an helpful  Although the folks at the bar didn t even ask if I wanted something to drink while I waited for my order  But besides that all was good ,4,2018-01-31
Snooze is probably my favorite brunch spot in AZ  I recommend coming during the week cause weekends the wait can be over an hour   Our waitress was super nice and accommodating  We came in for my birthday and my friends insisted on telling her it was my birthday so she said I ll see what I can do  She brought out a cinnamon pancake  Soooo good     I usually order Chili Verde Benedict  so good  It has the perfect amount of spice without being too spicy ,5,2018-02-01
Snooze is always a good spot for breakfast or brunch   if you have the time and patience to wait  It s a pretty popular joint so always plan accordingly as the wait time will typically be at least be    minute to an hour long    This was my first time at this new location and surprisingly it wasn t as busy  Could also be because it was a weekday morning    Quality of food was great as always  I came here for my friend s birthday and she received a complimentary Cinnamon Roll pancake   which she loved    Their pancakes are actually one of my favorites on the menu  Generous sized and not too sweet  The sweet potato pancake is my personal favorite    Tip  the hash browns come cupped  which taste rather soggy in my opinion  so I always ask from them fried flat ,5,2018-02-02
WOW  Best Breakfast place in this area  No one can compete  We got here and there was bit of wait but the fact you can pregame at the bar was amazing  The food was excellent and the service even better  I had the daily pancake and it was so good  I ll be back ,5,2018-02-04
In town visiting and love loved loved this place our server was so knowledgeable and such a great help on choosing th the right dish  The food came out on in perfect time and the glasses were never empty  So much flavor amazing prices  Definitely coming back everytime I m in town ,5,2018-02-05
I came here with a group of friends and the service was good but a little slow because they were so busy for Sunday brunch  We enjoyed our time  I just wasn t enthusiastic about my eggs Benedict I ordered  It was the Bella Bella with cream cheese hollandaise  burrata  and I think a slice of soft cheese  not noticeable with all the hollandaise  and a balsamic drizzle on a ciabatta slice  It sounds a lot better than what it ended up being  The meat was folded and only covered about     of the toast so    s of my meal was just egg and toast  The cream cheese hollandaise just tasted like regular hollandaise  The balsamic was so minimal I didn t taste it  My husband loved his breakfast pot pie  I will get that next time ,4,2018-02-05
The Breakfast Pot Pie is life changing  Cappuccino is bomb as well  Even though it was a bit busy when we arrived  seating was prompt and the service was awesome  I highly recommend ,5,2018-02-09
I liked tbe ambience  The outdoor seating looked nice  Chose an booth along the wall for more of a dim setting  Great place for conversation   The food was amazing both in presentation and taste  Breakfast food pretty much never feels me up so I at least want it to taste good and this place did not disappoint   The prices were right on target                 I believe  but that was the steak and eggs  Average                  Didn t have a drink but        ,5,2018-02-15
Two benny duos  Bella Bella and I love you elote     I love you elote and I can t remember the other  along with one blueberry streusel pancake     yuuum,5,2018-02-16
This place is by far the best breakfast establishment around  Food is all so fresh  The morning drinks are awesome  like the bloody Mary s  mimosa  and Eggs   bacon bourbon  From the unique plays on eggs Benedict to the breakfast tacos to the breakfast pot pie  You will not be disappointed ,5,2018-02-16
Snooze is always a jam  Let s be real  it s so good and always an amazing experience  Always  you re not reading this for reviews of the food  there are plenty of those  Try reading this for the service  It s impeccable  we were always well kept  always water topped off  and is just a great time  We were seated even though our entire party was not there  but it was okay  did not feel rushed one bit  great work guys  Thanks for he great time to catch up with friends  and to be able to enjoy some amazing food ,5,2018-02-19
I have liked snooze for years  but the last   times I have ate at this location  our food has come out cold or lukewarm    ,2,2018-02-20
You absolutely need to try the Eggs  Benedict  Usually I am not even a fan of them but I decided to try the Elote Benedict and I am sure glad I did  The quinoa  corn  and that hollandaise were married to perfection  I have found a new favorite place when I happen to be down in the valley ,5,2018-02-22
A wonderful meal   Creative and fresh  Do not miss a chance to eat at Snooze   Sweet potato pancakes are light and sweet   My wife had the daily special which was lemon blueberry pancakes   Very mild flavor that was perfect   No syrup necessary   The service is first rate ,5,2018-02-23
Love  Love  LOVE  Everything  absolutely everything was great  From waiting to be seated to paying the bill  Our waitress was super amazing  she offered us a try of one of their popular pancakes  I think she realized it was taking a little long  which wasn t even that long  at all  delish  I ordered the Benny Duo  Chile Verde Barbacoa  and Bella Bella  Wow  this is definitely a place that lives up to the hype  definitely would come again  I m not a huge breakfast person but this isn t breakfast  it s like Hipster Breakfast  LOL  I don t know how to explain it  like healthy and gourmet ,5,2018-02-23
My favorite breakfast spot  I miss the bloody Mary s due to getting pregnant but I look forward to have one again soon  The food is to die for   If you don t get a pancake for the table  your lost ,5,2018-02-24
We had to wait    min but well worth it  Hostess was sweet  waitress fantastic and food delicious  The only problem was having to make a decision on what to order ,5,2018-02-25
Excellent breakfasts when things are not rushed  On Sunday mornings things just fall apart  you can t get a coffee refill and the food comes out cold   The rest of the week they are spot on ,3,2018-02-25
Like we ve come to expect from Snooze  the food is always good and the choices interesting   However  unlike the Tempe location  their histesseshave no clue what they are doing  We ve been there twice  been told that the wait would be between       minutes and then waited an hour before being seated  Each time  they either  lost  or place in the queue or wrote down the wrong number  We re fine with a longer wait  but at least be realistic about the time  or be organized enough to adhere to your own time frames    Both times  we were told that we were  next  and then proceeded to wait another    minutes as others were seated before us  And  they never actually apologized for any of this    Until they fix their front desk  we will make the drive elsewhere for breakfast  No food is worth that kind of wait and treatment ,1,2018-02-25
We waited for   hours to eat    Party of      It was a Saturday at   am   The food was okay   Nothing spectacular   People who came after us were sat before us   We will not be coming back ,1,2018-02-26
We loved this restaurant  Staff was friendly   I didn t feel rushed  There s a bar area in the front but it s doesn t deter the place from being family friendly  I took my    year old     yr old  Food was absolutely delicious  I ordered the breakfast pot pie and finished it  My daughter ordered Nannas hot chocolate pancakes   it had a huge marshmallow on top   came with a chocolate syrup sauce  It was too much for her but if you want a dessert to share that breakfast dish is great  Lots of options for different diets  We will be back   ,5,2018-02-27
Took our friend from out of town here and she loved it   We were able to get the pancake sampler to share   We got blueberry danish original and sweet potato all were delicious but personally a whole one would be too sweet for me   The service there is top notch everyone is helpful and friendly ,4,2018-02-28
Snooze is a fantastic breakfast place  The Benedicts are to die for  I like to go here at least once a month,5,2018-03-02
Food and service were good  Found the booths rather cramped  In general I did not find it much better than Denny s  but then what can you do with Bacon and Eggs       coffee    ,2,2018-03-04
Finally stopped in  and I m glad we did   The food tasted great   The hash was delicious     Service was fast and professional   Looking forward to coming back another time to try the Bloody Mary s ,5,2018-03-08
AMAZING    If you re looking for great food quality  and wonderful staff look no further than Snooze  You WILL NOT be disappointed  A very special shout out to Bobbi  Annika  Monica     BAM  You Rock ,5,2018-03-11
Never had such a bad breakfast  Ordered an omelet with mushrooms and sausage and cheese    the mushrooms tasted like the ones from a can  slimy and all  Not sure there was any sausage and the egg wasn t done  The hash browns were over seasoned  normally I m complaining they didn t season  and they weren t done  They weren t hash they were greasy undone potatoes  I didn t eat any of it  Waitress didn t say anything about my uneaten meal  The waitress was obviously a morning person which was great but is it really appropriate to keep calling my    year old mother  honey   I won t be returning ,1,2018-03-11
This was my first time eating at Snooze  hubby had checked it out previously  and it was absolutely delicious   We were drawn to this place because it s based in our home state of Colorado and the menu looked great  Although we dined on a very busy spring Sunday morning  yay for patios in Arizona    the food could not have been better  I had the seasonal dish called   I like You E Lote Benedict   which is described as Elote corn quinoa cakes topped with poached  I had scrambled instead  cage free eggs  chili lime hollandaise  cotija cheese and roasted corn salsa  and I think it s the best breakfast dish I ve ever had  Seriously  You need to try this place  It s awesome ,5,2018-03-13
Oh    yeah  You should go here   Take my time and money  Tacos for the girls  steak for the boys and more menu items for the entire gender spectrum  These are not your grandma s eggs  They are flipping  pun intended eggs   the breakfast genre on it s head    Take advantage of the optional  hour wait time  experience  It really makes you feel like you are about to eat some good ass breakfast  and you will ,4,2018-03-15
All I can say is yes yes yes yes  I love the pancake options  the drink options  and the spuds deluxe as well as the eggs and Sammy  The staff Is also as attentive as they Canby with the constant flow of customers they are have to deal with  Kudos to the overall experience ,5,2018-03-16
Friday              AM  Bad service  Period  After waiting for the hostess  we were seated  And that s the extent of acknowledgement we received  Multiple servers  walked by  not even a hello  We read over the menu and then put it away  as a sign that we re ready to order  Yet the party after us was greeted and seated with their server present  We were still waiting  can we at least be offered some water    It s not like it was crazy busy  it was steady   So after another   min of waiting we got up and left  Same hostess saw us leaving and just looked the other way  No bye  everything okay   or have a good day   So  we just walked next door to Modern Market  What a difference  Service and food    ,1,2018-03-16
Amazing food  great environment  excellent service   We were visiting in the area  Wish we had one in our home state ,5,2018-03-16
A fantastic addition to Ahwatukee   My kids beg to be taken here for the  OMG french toast  or the blueberry pancakes   I like the thick bacon and locally sourced ingredients   Food and service are excellent and a nice location  They even have breakfast and lunch cocktails that I will have to try someday when I m not driving   The prices are not bad at all   I love the fun decorating ,5,2018-03-17
Love this place  I went to their San Diego location and fell in love  I was super excited to see that there was one in PHX  The wait wasn t too bad  It was a thirty min wait but they sat us in    mins  Saw it was pet friendly which I love  since I m a pet lover    I went for the lower east sider plate and it was delicious  If you are looking for a great breakfast and brunch place  Snooze is the perfect place ,5,2018-03-17
So many items on the menu that I wanted to try but could only have one  Still  got the combo benedict and it was delicious  One with the green chile the other on the corn masa  Very popular  the wait was    minutes but we checked in with the yelp app and got seated in    ,5,2018-03-20
Absolutely love the food and atmosphere  But  curiously  there is a    minute wait when there are more than    tables open and ready for occupants  Not sure if this is the new business model  However  doesn t seem smart when people are walking away ,1,2018-03-24
Went to Snooze to enjoy brunch with my daughter   at       A M  we had a    minute wait  heck it was a Saturday  No one acknowledged the wait  The waitress was just going through the routine  If you hate your job get a new one   The service was slow and unorganized  The sweet potato pancakes were delicious  The rest of the food was marginal like the experience  This location was sub par ,3,2018-03-24
I love this place   well worth the time   money keeps you full all day   I had the best eggs Benedict of my life even though I bit my tongue while eating this delicious food  I would do it again SMH I was thinking about how good the food was all day  seriously ,5,2018-03-25
Over rated restaurant located in AMCshopping center on Ray Rd  Servers are overly sweet seeming  needy  for approval  Food was basic  This place is so busy and I m not sure why  Tables inside and out ,1,2018-03-28
On a busy Wednesday morning I found myself ousted from my home office and on the hunt for sustenance and caffeine   Recently I had heard about a Snooze   new eatery in Ahwatukee  so I decided to give it a try   The decor was modern diner chic   fun  but comfortable   While the much lauded breakfast  I tried the Snooze Spuds Deluxe  would rate around three or four stars  the coffee was easily worth five stars   My cappuccino was perfect   What impressed me most was the wait staff   they were friendly and accommodating   While many restaurants rush customers out the door  the staff at Snooze encouraged me to take my time and relax   I will definitely be returning ,5,2018-03-28
This was my first visit to this location   I typically go to the location near ASU     First the good   We ordered the Chile Verde Benedict and it was quite amazing   The flavors were unbelievable   We also got a Sum oa Cake to split and it was pure heaven   I am so impressed that they will split plates without any hassle   Now for the issues here   They sat us with the bartender  not at the bar    There were at least    other staff members milling about and the place was only about     full   Because she was making drinks and entertaining the guests sitting at the bar  she never once attempted to refill our coffees   We had to flag down two different wait staff at separate times to get refills   Also  our food came out ice cold  I am assuming because she was unable to check on it when it was done in the window   It was eventually ran out to us by yet another wait person   The flavors were right on   The food was fresh   Unfortunately  it was just ice cold   Finally  there was a guy in the place that I would assume was the manager   He spent a lot of time looking at his cell phone  but I think he should have been checking on tables to see how things were going   I will give this location another chance  but will be certain to ask not to be seated with the bartender   If it weren t for the service and cold food  I would have given   stars hands down ,3,2018-03-29
Just your average breakfast place with a finesse twist  I wasn t really a big fan of this place for a couple of reasons    One thing I didn t like about this place is that everything was greasy  I ordered the Snooze classic with extra grease   If You were to touch the side of plate  walk outside  crack an egg on your palm  you would have a perfectly fried egg  The chicken sausage was also ok but once again so much grease  My friends plate was also in the same condition with grease all on the sides of the plate    Eggs were cooked to perfection  the hash browns were crispy and seasoned well  The iced coffees were delicious and there Cuban cups of coffee    Overall  customer service is there and got us in and out ,3,2018-03-31
Eris made a regularly great Snooze visit awesome    The food was delicious  the service was excellent and they were able to get us seated faster than expected though it was Easter  Going to snooze ensures a great day  because they take great care of their customers  Thank you Eris ,5,2018-04-01
I normally don t do posts on here but I had to give a quick S O to our fantastic waitress  Eris  She went above and beyond to make our experience at Snooze fabulous  She was super on top of everything down to even the smallest details  Thank you so much for being so great Eris ,5,2018-04-01
Went to snooze today for breakfast this place is top notch  The bloody Mary s are amazing      Food was top notch I had the breakfast burrito To die for  My husband got the eggs Benedict is bomb,5,2018-04-05
The Snooze chain is my favorite brunch in the country  Not exaggerating  I went with my family  after a recent trip to Boston where my mom and I looked for the best french toast in the city  We could not compare any of the french toasts we tried elsewhere to the OMG at Snooze  They also get their pineapples fresh from Hawaii regularly  and the servers will usually let you know if you ask   The spuds deluxe is also great for sharing between   people  While you wait  you can play ping pong or walk around University  Love this place  Thanks ,5,2018-04-07
You didn t make the smartest decision by going on a Sunday morning for our first experience  The place was absolutely packed with a    to    minute wait  I will say that once we did enjoy it  I would like to go back during the week or maybe when it s not so crowded  The options on the menu amazing  I feel like I could go here every day for two weeks and look at the same thing  Prices were reasonable I just thought it was way too packed ,4,2018-04-08
Excellent breakfast choices  Not just the normal breakfast menu  Very creative meals  Very nice outdoor eating environment  Friendly staff ,5,2018-04-11
 nd time here and will absolutely come back again and again  You must try this place ,5,2018-04-13
Breakfast potpie very unique and super delicious  And the sweet potato pancakes are to die for,4,2018-04-13
Great breakfast place the wait was a little long but it was worth it  I had the Snooze Classic which included eggs sausage and hash browns  I had a pancake instead of the toast  Everything was delicious  Service was slow but they were so busy it was understandable ,4,2018-04-13
This is my first time at Snooze and I was impressed  The place has beautiful modern decoration and seating  It has both inside and outside seating  The food menu has variety of choice and special for vegetarian people like me  I got the mushroom omelet and man it was delicious  You can substitute meat with tofu and harsh brown  with fresh fruits  The service was good as well even though they were extremely busy  Overall I am really happy with my visit and probably will come back when I am in town again ,4,2018-04-13
Always good    Crowded but worth the wait    I had the shrimp and grits     it was amazing     my son loved it too but will probably order off the adult menu next time       for little kids it s a great deal   ,5,2018-04-15
OMG French toast and pineapple upside down pancakes  Absolutely delicious  Great service  Get there early or expect to wait  but it s worth the wait  Bloody Mary s are yummy as well ,5,2018-04-15
So happy to have found Snooze  Actually I drove by many times but hasn t stopped in so after church Sunday trekked over   Even though no gluten free menu  a lot of items can be made gluten free  I had frittata which is naturally gluten free  it tasted great and no tummy issues afterwards    It s a busy spot on Sunday for those brunchers wanting mimosas etc  There s a lot of options for me to try,5,2018-04-17
Food  delicious Service  friendly and attentive Price     Overall    Snooze has consistently been one of my favorite Saturday morning brunch spots  but today was the best experience I ve had yet  Our server  Tiff  was so sweet and helpful today  Her warm personality took a delicious  fun experience to a level that my friends and I won t soon forget  I ll be back again soon  and I encourage anyone else to come here too  Trust me  it lives up to the hype ,5,2018-04-21
All I can say is I wish I had one of these restaurants in Wisconsin  This is my second visit to this restaurant for brunch while visiting Arizona  My first experience was last year and it blew me away  So I was so excited to return on my visit this year for another amazing brunch  I can t say enough about how much I love this place  Their menu is absolutely fantastic and the service is always wonderful  And did I mention how tasty their drinks are  If you love bloody Mary s  definitely give it a try  The Mimosa is very refreshing as well  I m a huge fan of eggs Benedict and I love the fact that you can try to different types as an entr e  That s what I did last year when I was here and that s what I did again this year when I was here  I wish I could eat here every weekend  that would be a dream come true    Can t wait to come back next year and have another amazing brunch  Until then your delicious eggs Benedict will be in my dreams   ,5,2018-04-21
The wait staff was outstanding  The food was delicious  The coffee was fantastic I highly recommend going ,4,2018-04-24
Wow    terrific food  I had the breakfast tacos and now I want to go home and make them  This will be my go to breakfast whenever I am in Phoenix  I love the retro decorations ,5,2018-04-24
Brunch lovers  this is a definite must try  I love going out for breakfast  and was certainly not disappointed  Everything on the menu looked delicious  I ordered the Bella Benedict  and a coffee  and my husband got a scramble with lox  They were both amazing  Service was excellent  but be prepared to wait at least    minutes on the weekend for brunch  That being said  it s worth it  Can t wait to come back,5,2018-04-25
Do not go here for breakfast  Their kitchen has messed up my order consistently the last four times I have eaten here  It takes    minutes to get food that isn t what you ordered to then wait for them to remake it for you  Yes they remade them for me  however now my fiance has to eat cold eggs  Don t waste your time with this joint that takes an hour to do a to go order incorrectly  I won t be giving this place another try ,1,2018-04-26
Just took our friends from out of town here and tried the Pineapple Upside Down Pancake  Oooooh my god was that good  I was very set on my Sandwich I Am  but now I want more pancakes  Everything at this place is amazing ,5,2018-04-28
Best breakfast lunch place in ahwatukee   Great menu food prices and atmosphere   I go at least once a week ,5,2018-04-28
Awesome customer service  I d like to thank Kelly  our server  as well as the assistant manager  They were very attentive to our needs  I really enjoyed the food  and they have a lot to offer for those who have special dietary needs  I have celiac disease so I can t have gluten  as well as a dairy allergy  and I was so pleased that there were many options for me  Good coffee too ,5,2018-05-01
This is actually the first snooze I ve been to where the service wasn t terrible  We had a    min wait and gave our number for text and they were very accurate with the wait time  I really appreciated the server for repeating the special to me and explaining my choices and cost  I probably should have ordered the large special cinnamon white chocolate chip pancake  but I got a flight of pancakes with a French toast  Pancakes however were dry  Food is sweet but standard  You come here more for the  environment   But make no mistake  here is a good choice ,4,2018-05-04
This place is s must for brunch when visiting PHX Scottsdale Tempe   It s your classic upscale diner   Really known for their Benedict s and Pancakes   Benedict s are high quality and the presentation is nice     They allow you to sub your sides for a sweet dish     They are also an ethical restaurant   A lot of locally sourced ingredients   Plus they support a lot of nonprofits and charities     Note there are long waits during weekends  which isn t abnormal for any good brunch spot in America    However  this place is horrible at turning tables over   You will be waiting for a table and will notice at least   or tables that no one is sitting at   On the bright side at least they give you free coffee while you wait   If you are short on time this isn t the place to go     Bathrooms are clean  so that s a good sign that the kitchen is clean ,4,2018-05-06
I came in here today with a friend of mine to grab some breakfast  So we wait about    min to get seated and we start looking for our order  We decide  and put the order in  Not more than    second  no exaggeration  later I ask the waitress if I could change my order because I was kind of rushed in picking and changed my mind  No big deal right  Happens all the time  She says they couldn t change the order because she had already put it in  So  obviously annoyed that I would not enjoy the meal I would pay for  accepted this  My friend who was with me has been a server for about   years and said there s no reason why she shouldn t switch my order for what I truly want  So I ask a different waitress and she says the same thing  but says she will put in my new order  The food took around    min to come out  even though the only reason she said I could not change my order was because they start making it immediately which was obviously a lie  and the original food order comes out  I was so confused but around    min later my new order comes out  and I send the original plate back untouched with the woman who brought out my new food  So the bill comes and she had charged me for both meals  I call her over saying I would not pay for something I didn t eat  especially after the horrible service  So she just walks away  another server comes up accusing us of putting the food in my friends to go box as if we were trying to get a free meal  Like no hun  we were just not paying for food we didn t eat  She said  well that s how this restaurant works for future notice  in a very rude way  Needless to say  we will never come back here after the horrible service from multiple servers  For being new in the area  they should really be making a better impression ,1,2018-05-07
Good food   Great service  Fun atmosphere  Kind of pricey for breakfast   If it weren t so pricey it would get  stars ,4,2018-05-08
Very good food with very slow service  Fairly expensive for a breakfast place so pack your patience and wallet ,4,2018-05-09
I had been wanting to try this place for a long while  but for some reason I was intimidated to go inside  I don t know  Well  since they opened one in ahwatukee  I decided to give it shot since I didn t have to travel far haha  I got the duo benny with their original eggs Benedict and the green chile eggs benedict with barbacoa  Their original had a smoked cheddar hollandaise which was so GOOD    The barbacoa on the other benny was DELICIOUS  Also  their hasbrowns are also some of the best I ve eaten  They almost had a sour cream and onion taste and it was presented so nicely  I would go back just for those alone  The only reason why I didn t give   stars was because my food didn t seem very warm when I got it  like maybe it had been sitting there for a bit before it came out to me  and some sides we ordered were forgotten  BUT I will definitely be back ,4,2018-05-09
The blueberry danish pancakes here are really good  I also got the og eggs benedict  and it wasn t bad  but it wasn t that great either  The service was great and the waitress was very nice ,4,2018-05-12
Went here for our first time  we were lucky in that we had no wait  Our server was very nice  and when she found out it was our first time eating here  she brought us a sample pancake  This place is a little on the expensive  side  and the reason I gave it   stars was that my husbands eggs benedict were cold all the way through  I ordered the breakfast tacos  and mine were good  so I am guessing they made my husbands first  and it sat there getting cold  and then made my tacos  Our total breakfast bill was over        for   meals  and no beverages  I told my husband to let our server know  but it had already taken so long for us to get our food  We are new to the area  and will cross this off our list of places to have breakfast ,2,2018-05-14
Normally my experiences at Snooze have been great   However  this morning I was served a cold breakfast   The restaurant manager did apologize and offered to fix it but we didn t have the time to wait for another serving to be prepared ,2,2018-05-19
A guest and I were seated on a busy Saturday morning within    minutes but no server came to our table for      minutes  No water or acknowledgement  We almost left  Maybe the staff was shorthanded    We ended up ordering because we wanted to give the restaurant a chance  When our food arrived  it was delicious but barely warm    Worth trying the pineapple upside down pancakes  Thick generous cakes that swam in a vanilla cream sauce  with chunky diced pineapple bits embedded in the pancakes  Bacon was thick and flavorful  Eggs cooked just right  slightly firm with yolk soft enough to run    slice of toast though    for the price  an extra slice should have made an appearance ,3,2018-05-21
Snooze has very good food and I am never disappointed with it  It just takes forever to get seated and once you are seated the service is also slow  It s a fun atmosphere and place to eat if you have half a day to waste here  I d much rather go elsewhere to Butter s Butterfield s where yes  there is a wait  but they are very fast with moving tables along  Snooze needs to work on making food faster  It s just breakfast  not a gourmet meal  People also do camp out at tables all morning too so moving tables isn t very fast because people don t leave ,3,2018-05-27
The atmosphere is Great  the food was better  I went with the Shrimp and grits  It came with this extra oil which I could have done without  the shrimp had the best flavor  I would have preferred my andouille sausage to be sliced versus crumbled  All in all the portions were amazing I couldn t even finish it   if you re from the south the grits will throw you off  like they did me   they were a consistency of mashed potatoes  I would definitely go back to try something different  ,4,2018-05-27
Got there as a single at        The wait was    minutes she said  it was       when I sat down ready to order  Chris was my waiter  happy  informative  Took my order  Simple breakfast  nothing fancy  My food got there at        just warm  The OJ Was cold  the food was just warm and average tasting  I do not think I would go back for an hour wait for just average food   I will keep looking for my special breakfast spot   The one nice thing was they offer complementary water and coffee while you wait  Good on a warm day ,3,2018-05-28
Everything we had was absolutely amazing  Service was excellent  My husband had the classic with chorizo which was a patty  He loved it  My son ordered the pancake flight   I had one bite and talk about melt in your mouth perfectness  Then there is my eggs Benedict  It was perfect   My son tried them for the first time and said that was what he was ordering from now on  We will be back because this place is awesome    Hubby said his Bloody Mary was the best he s had in a restaurant ,5,2018-05-29
Great food  Fresh  affordable  and service was spectacular  One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix,5,2018-05-29
Clean  fresh  good food  Full bar with breakfast  Uh yeah  The veggies in the Bloody Mary s are pickled and delicious  don t ignore them  Quality ingredients in every bite  Cut to it  best breakfast in the Ahwatukee area hands down  Unless you like the microwaved meat salt at Cracker Barrel  lol ,5,2018-05-30
Love this place  Can get pretty busy if you go during the morning rush hour but if you get there early enough you will find a spot  Food is great and so is the coffee ,4,2018-06-02
Really enjoyed my  st time eating here  I had the shrimp and grits and added mushrooms to it  It was delicious    Definitely will be coming back often,5,2018-06-04
I ve been to Snooze twice now and I plan to make it again and again as often I can  Simply put  this place is amazing  Love the vibe  loved the food  The pineapple upside down pancakes are simply the best you could ever hope for  The OMG French toast is also amazing  So if you are reading this and debating whether to go to Snooze or not  quit wasting your time reading this and don t miss out on the Snooze experience ,5,2018-06-06
This breakfast brunch spot has a very fun vibe  The restaurant colors are bright and welcoming to start your morning off  I ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie and was incredibly pleased  The bread was SO good almost tasting like a flaky puff pastry  Their sausage gravy lights up your taste buds because it is homemade  Not your average pot pie but definitely worth a try  On top of the pot pie you can have it topped with an egg of your liking  Typically I get over easy because I love it when the yolk is runny  I got hash browns on the side    extra crispy  Mm  I love a good brunch spot ,4,2018-06-07
Was in Phx for a wedding last week had breakfast here on Saturday  This place was crackin  Super busy  but with good reason  Our food was outstanding as was the service  Kept the coffee cup full which I really appreciated  Brought a couple of the pineapple upside down pancakes to the table as a gift  They were awesome  I had a scramble with tomato  bacon  onion   avacado and cheese and it was terrific        min wait on a Saturday  but well worth it ,5,2018-06-08
Really enjoyed my  st time eating here  I had the shrimp and grits and added mushrooms to it  It was delicious    Definitely will be coming back oft,5,2018-06-10
This place is AMAZING  It was packed inside and out on a Saturday morning but it only took    minutes to get a table for      First  the ambiance and scenery was hip and chic  The music was nice   not too loud or soft and a great variety from hip hop  Migos  to pop    Second  the service was concierge   excellent  We never had dry mouths  dirty plates or anything else  Our server was upbeat  friendly and make great recommendations   Now for the food    let me just say this is officially my Fav breakfast spot  We had the pancake flight  blueberry  pineapple upside down and the special for day   bacon filled   shrimp and grits  special spuds and mmm mmm mimosas    I m going to try everything as you should too ,5,2018-06-10
I ve been to the Tempe location a few times and it seems to flow a lot better than this location  I m guessing it s because it s new  A few friends and I came in on a Saturday morning and it was packed  We were told it d be    minutes and we ended up waiting     We understood because it was so busy  We had a very sweet server but a few things got forgotten  My friend ordered a Bloody Mary with bacon and didn t receive the bacon  I ordered a side of fruit with my meal that I didn t receive but was charged for as well  I ordered the spring has sprung frittata  It lacked a lot of flavor and needed hot sauce and salt  I probably wouldn t order it again  A friends orders got a little mixed up  they ordered the same dish  one was gluten free and the other had no cheese but it was no biggie  I think that since this place just got up and running it s just a bit slow and unorganized at this point  I will probably come again in a few months to try it out again  My friend got the green Bloody Mary and only said good things  As for right now I ll stick to the Tempe location  I,3,2018-06-15
Stayed at Wild Horse Pass  this Eatery is just a hop and a skip away    Impressed by the complimentary coffee while you wait for a table  nice touch for a restaurant that seems to always have a waitlist  For a chain restaurant I appreciate how they seem to go out of their way to support local charities and buy some locally sourced ingredients  Their mission to help serve their local communities reminded me a lot of Even Stevens Sandwiches  The staff were all sporting some type of PRIDE support  also really great    We had the regular Beni III and the Breakfast Pot Pie  with   side breakfast taco and   side pancake  The pancake was disappointing  really dry  The hash browns that came with our meals were ok  not my favorite  They were more of a hash brown casserole ish thing  kind of dry with a lot of pepper    The breakfast taco was delicious  the green chile hollandaise on top of it was so good  They are good at hollandaise here because the hollandaise on the Beni was also on point  with plenty of lemon  just the way I like it  The ham on the Beni was flavorful and tasty  The Breakfast Pot Pie was a fun play on a traditional biscuits and gravy  we enjoyed it  their rosemary sausage gravy was really wonderful  light  but still rich at the same time  Not an overwhelmingly heavy gravy    The service was a ok  Surprised to see so many people waiting and so many empty tables at the same time  Maybe they didn t have enough staff to keep up    Seems like a great place for a family breakfast  menu has plenty of traditional options and some more adventurous choices as well  Will gladly return when in the area ,4,2018-06-17
The food and menu are good  So far  I have had the Steak and eggs benny and the corned beef hash  I am disappointed in the service  From sitting to finally being served food on my last visit was over   hr  We sat outside and the servers were hardly to be seen  When possible  I had to flag them down for water    I hope other people have a better experience than what my family and I had   Thanks for reading ,2,2018-06-17
I brought my foodie Dad here and we both loved it   him for the cool   s decor and me for the environmental friendliness  There was a very long line  but there s free coffee and water while you wait which is a nice touch  The best thing I ate was the chorizo  it s an absolute must try  I ll be back to try the eggs benny on a less busy day ,5,2018-06-19
I absolutely love this place  I go every weekend and the service food is always fantastic  If you ever need a good mimosa and breakfast burrito  this is the place to go ,5,2018-06-20
This was a pleasant surprise  The menu covers all types of appetites   The wait staff is superb  We mentioned it was our first time and asked for recommendations   We all made our choices and even shared   Before our choice came out the waitress brought out a sample of their pineapple upside down pancake  DELICIOUS   We all loved it The combination of flavors was spot on  The buttermilk pancake was good all on its own   It was good to see they had a great mix of beverages available   including a full bar   We will definitely be back again ,5,2018-06-23
Definitely are the choose from all of the tempting things on the menu  I would highly recommend any of the eggs Benedict  You can even mix and match sure benedicts  which is a huge plus      The atmospere is quirky but very open and cool  There is covered patio seating in addition to the spacious indoor area  Our weight turn or waitresses have always been nice here  Expect a bit of a wait on the weekends but there is free coffee at the reception area to make it a little more bearable   My wife is a mimosa person and I am a bloody Mary guy so we both have ample options to choose from on the menu There are also a ton of custom pancakes and you will not be disappointed by anything you choose on the menu ,5,2018-06-26
I love brunch  It s seriously one of my favorite meals  Call me a total millennial I don t care  Me and my friends have made this our brunch spot  and every time we come in we request Eris who will ALWAYS take care of you and make sure you re all set  Seriously  we re all in the service industry and most of us are servers and Eris is absolutely the way all servers should be  She even remembers what our usuals are  She takes time to make sure our food comes out perfect  and vegan for our friends who are vegan  She keeps us updated if there s a delay  and never hesitates to be friendly and kind  I love the food  the Spicy Dirty Drunken Chai is BOMB and the OMG French toast is to die for  I love Snooze and Eris   ,5,2018-07-07
This place just hits the spot period  Good location easy to find and staff very helpful  Keep in mind On the weekend to get here early because the wait sometimes can get long     We came early at the perfect time sat right away and helped right away  I ve had the Benedict s and they got a great variety which are amazing  This time in I had the shrimp and grits and oh man it was excellent  I think I had the whole thing down in a matter of minutes that s how good it was  Full of flavor and spice and shrimp cooked perfect with a good portion of them    The fianc  had a egg omelette toast and hash and she said the same thing on how great it is   We will be continuing to come here but will pick the time wisely lol    Don t pass on coming here you won t regret it,5,2018-07-08
Busy  busy  busy I was able to see the number of people putting together orders but was concerned how we waited for water and how long it took our order I shall admit the food is very good and we didn t mind waiting for a table  they even have water or coffee while you wait Will go back Nice patio Everyone is friendly,3,2018-07-08
I love the service and atmosphere  It was clearly busy when I went in but the service was impeccable nonetheless  The food was fantastic and came out really quickly  I highly recommend their steak and eggs benny I couldn t get enough of it  Please come try this place out I promise you won t regret it ,5,2018-07-10
Overrated  overcrowded  mediocre food  Lousy coffee  Expect long waits and service errors ,3,2018-07-13
I ve eaten at the restaurant once since it opened m  We only order to go because the lines are always long  Food is good but overrated ,3,2018-07-15
Best breakfast and service   Melissa is the greatest  always does a fantastic job taking care of us  ,5,2018-07-15
Came in on a Saturday morning     minutes wait  Staff is super friendly  restaurant is clean and although the food took a whole  they were slammed  well worth the wait  We tried pancakes  light and fluffy  not too rich  And omelette was great cooked perfectly  Highly recommend  We ll be back  Kudos to our server Christopher He was friendly Prompt and checked in before and after food ,5,2018-07-15
I loooove Snooze   My favorites so far are the Blueberry Danish Pancakes  Pineapple Upside down pancakes  and the Breakfast tacos  While drinking a Mimosa  Totally recommend this place ,5,2018-07-16
I m just unsure what was going on here last Friday around   am  We were promptly seated  greeted and given great suggestions when we ordered and ordered at the first opportunity  I am familiar with Snooze and their standards  as I come from Denver and was stoked to have a Snooze nearby  They sent out a pancake early for the table to munch on  but it was confusing because I had ordered a big pancake for my breakfast and the girl who brought it out didn t quite know what to say and was just mumbling words and after she walked away the whole table decided that they awkwardly brought my pancake out first  so I ate it  and then all the food came out and there was my actual pancake  Suddenly my first pancake was recognized as a gift for the entire table and not my appetizer  I am thankful that it wasn t one with PB or peanuts as I am allergic  but lets train the Snoozers to SPEAK UP  pleaseeeee  All in all  they change a few things on the menu with the seasons  There are a lot of creative things that you cannot get elsewhere  but there are also more simplistic things for the less adventurous  All is delicious no matter what catches your eye  Just be prepared to wait the time it takes to get a seat at any Denver location for your food here  about       min  The thing I miss the most off any Snooze menu was the Brioche French Toast with the amazing caramel like sauce and candied nuts   Bonus  If you like the sound of the benedicts  but don t like the runny egg it is ok to get it scrambled  Also  there is a  secret menu  ,4,2018-07-19
We have been a few times already but on the weekends and wait times are a bit long   Food drinks  and service has been great  Hash browns are amazing  Good location   Dog friendly patio ,5,2018-07-20
Snooze is a pretty amazing restaurant  I ve only been to the one in Phoenix on Camelback  Of course I ve been there about    times or more and I love it  I had never tried this particular one until today    Four of us went for breakfast  We were not disappointed    I love the Way Snooze is decorated  very late   s early   s  I love how everything matches  It s my favorite    The food is absolutely amazing  Everything I try it s really good  On this visit I had the avocado smashed eggs Benedict  Love them   Divine    It was one of my friends birthday and they even brought her out a beautiful pancake with whip cream and fruit on top and a candle  it was so nice  We had coffee water hibiscus iced tea and hot tea between all four of us everyone loved it    The birthday girl had Rancho Eggs   another friend had the upside down pineapple pan cake   then another friend had a egg white omelette  Everything was perfect   Lots of parking in the lot  The restaurant was very clean    If you are having a hard time locating it  it s in the same shopping center as Home Goods  On the south side of Ray Road ,5,2018-07-25
I am VERY picky about my eggs  so you may want to take that into consideration   My rating for this place is lower than many    In short  I don t like my eggs over cooked   Scrambled eggs  my usual  should not even hint at rubbery   I get rubber eggs here half the time  the other half they are great so this place isn t reliable for me that way     And it takes a long time to get the food after it s been ordered   Which is acceptable at a busy place that cooks food to order   But not being able to see the process in the kitchen I sometimes feel the food may have been cooked properly but it takes too long for the server to get it to you   The last guy we had I saw him sitting and talking to the girl who was putting together fresh sets of utensils instead of being attentive to customers   We needed refills of coffee etc and had a difficult time with that and the food was cool and probably sat under lights too long ,3,2018-07-29
Had breakfast at Snooze today  The Breakfast Tacos were absolutely delicious  The Blueberry Pancake was awesome  My husband had Ham Benny  It was also terrific  The manager Mariam was so nice  We will definitely be back every chance we get ,5,2018-08-05
My favorite breakfast place  I tried it first in Colorado  When I got home to AZ  I was so happy that they put one around my neighborhood  This place is the BEST for breakfast  Also  the coffee is EXCELLENT  ,5,2018-08-06
I have been to snooze in the past and remember it being a   out of   stars however today I m going to go with    The service is pretty slow and if your not getting pancakes it s not really worth it  I do have to say their pancakes are awesome and they provide all the nutritional facts in their menu to help those who are trying g to watch what they eat  If you have never been it is still worth a try ,3,2018-08-09
Always a solid choice    except on this day   Ordered a cup of coffee and  pancake  not a tough order right   Sadly  it must have been the first pancake to warm up the griddle   Hard and crisp on both sides and doughy not fluffy interior   Waited   weeks to have that pancake  it was hard earned in the gym      sadness ,3,2018-08-10
Love this location  Best layout  Not insanely crowded   Always a great selection of food  I will say the biscuit and gravy dish was very underwhelming  The filo dough left muxubto he desired and there was really no substance to the meal  Only meal I haven t enjoyed at Snooze   Everything else was amazing,4,2018-08-11
Heard great things about this place  so I tried it out recently  Definitely recommend the pancakes  However  I found that my eggs were cold and lacked seasoning and overall flavor  The service was pretty good   I was with a large party so I m being a little more forgiving   but they forgot both my food and my bill  Great pancakes  great hashbrowns   so definitely go there if youre looking for one of those ,3,2018-08-11
This is my go to breakfast place  Everything I have tried has been delicious  but if I had to recommend something  I would suggest Juan s Breakfast Tacos  one of the pancakes  a pancake flight  perhaps   or the  Pot pie   which isn t really a pot pie but is definitely delicious  The coffee and alcoholic drinks are pretty good  but I come here for the food  not the drinks    Service has always been quick and friendly  and I ve never had to wait too long for a table  It s in a shopping center  so there s plenty of parking and it s easy to get to ,5,2018-08-11
Great place for breakfast and drinks when you work the night shift and get off at  am  Always happy with the service and food here  Highly recommend coming here hungry  especially if youre going to try the breakfast burritos ,5,2018-08-13
We were really excited about this new location bc it s so much closer than the one we fell in love with in Phoenix  But this Snooze just isn t as good as the Phoenix one  talking both food and service wise  But I guess if you don t know any better you probably don t mind  We drive to the Phoenix location instead ,3,2018-08-16
Food was good but service was average  Friendly and knowledgeable server but empty water and coffee isn t what we expect at a breakfast place  Some places leave a small pot of hot coffee and carafe of water which would have alleviated our main beef ,4,2018-08-20
We went to this place for Brunch  The whole atmosphere is very lively and colorful  Loved the whole set up of colors like the yellows and green    It was pretty crowded for a weekday and we were seated immediately though  The menu is vast and everything feels very tempting and nice   I ordered a French toast neat  it was delicious  I am not sure if the maple syrup was a fake one or original but the whole presentation of the toast and taste wise was hands down really good    The price is average and it is a good place  I would definitely want to try other things on the menu before I change my rating  For now they serve and look neat ,4,2018-08-24
Blueberry pancakes were amazing   Great coffee and iced tea   Fun decor   Ordered a poached egg  it was perfectly cooked    piece of bacon  also perfectly crisped   with on amazing blueberry pancake   Definitely will be back ,5,2018-08-24
Second time at this location for breakfast  Good food  Average price  Good service  Nice breakfast cocktail selection  I ll be back a third time ,4,2018-08-29
We love Snooze  We had never been to this location before and our experience here was much better than at other locations in the past  We were seated right away  no wait  Service was fast and the staff were all friendly  The size of the B E A T  sandwich I ordered seemed bigger than at other locations  That was a nice surprise  It tasted just as delicious though ,4,2018-08-31
Snooze is seriously one of the best brunch places I ve been in a very long time  The service and the staff was amazing  the food was great  and it s extremely clean inside  The next time I m in AZ definitely coming back here ,5,2018-09-01
Great food  Lots of choices  Good vegetarian and even vegan choices  From egg selections to pancakes and flavored ones also  All very good  Must have a great chef to make it all so Igood  Be prepared for a little wait  It s a popular place  There is also a nice patio if the weather is not too hot ,5,2018-09-03
OOOOOOOOOHHH this spot is the joint jimmy jam   We went here on        and when we pulled up the place was jammed pack   I just knew that the wait would be very long  The hostess informed me that it would be         minutes  So we went to Marshall s in the same area   I was getting my Marshalls on got the text    minutes later  Talk about blown and blown away   I had to hide my Marshall digs    We sped back and were escorted to our table outside  I thought  uggh  but it was very cool with the fans and mist  Of course Arizona knows what they are doing   and this east coast girl is just getting used to it   We ordered the following  Pancake flight   Pineapple Upside Down pancake  Sunburst cake  and a blueberry pancake    Smashed Avocado Benny Egg Frittata  that wasn t the name  but that s what we had ,5,2018-09-03
I decided to treat myself to brunch on a weekday  Friday at    a m   and the place is surprisingly fairly busy  Katie gave me attentive and prompt service  The pot pie is lovely and light  It s a pastry with sausage gravy and carrots  It s unlike biscuits and gravy  and unlike a real pot pie    it s a unique dish  and quite nice  It is not heavily spiced  so it will not offend those who prefer food on the blander side  although a bit more spice would have suited me  I ordered my egg over medium rather than sunny side up  and it came out perfect  For an extra     I subbed out my hash browns for a pancake  The  sunburst   or something like that  a lemon poppyseed pancake with blackberries on top  It was not too sweet  and the flavor was subtle but delicious   It s a workday  so I had to resist the cafe cocktails  I need to come back on a weekend to try the AM Manhattan  bourbon  espresso  Irish cream  stranded milk  and a cherry  Yes  please  Next time ,5,2018-09-07
Amazing menu selections   It s hard to eat vegan at a breakfast focused restaurant  but they can accommodate you   always busy  so get there early ,5,2018-09-07
I love Snooze  From the very first time I tried the location in San Diego I have loved eating here     Generally I am not a fan of pancakes but the pancakes here are amazing  Every single thing I have ever had here has been wonderful   They have great breakfast drinks too   I am giving   less star because the last time I ate here  they gave me real chorizo instead of soy chorizo and I was sick for a few days since I don t eat meat ,4,2018-09-09
Such a cute and spunky brunch restaurant  Came to AZ for a girls trip and we wanted to find a good brunch spot  We went to the Tempe location on the ASU campus  We went during summer when school was out so it wasn t as packed  The staff was greeting us right away and seated us on a community table  which was nice if you don t want to wait for a table  Their OMG waffle was sweet and tasty  I definitely would go back ,5,2018-09-12
Great food and atmosphere  Slightly pricey  But really great quality  Fresh food and drinks ,5,2018-09-15
This place is always busy but it s worth the wait  I had the breakfast tacos and I had never had breakfast tacos but they were so so so good  I really loved them  The staff was great really helpful with suggestions since there is so much to choose  The freshly squeezed orange juice was bomb ,5,2018-09-16
The best breakfast place EVER  from the manager Holli  to our bartender melissa   The flavors  the atmosphere  everything  My friend and I had the pancake flight   Benedict and the breakfast pot pie  So thank you so much ,5,2018-09-16
After hearing several people rave about the breakfast at Snooze  I finally gave it a go and they were right    My BF and I scored two seats at the bar on a Sunday morning  We got there right in time as there were people lined out the door waiting for tables when we left    I m more of a waffle girl but couldn t help but try out their pancake flight as they had unique flavors  I chose a carrot cake pancake  blueberry and lemon poppy seed pancakes for my flight  WOW  These pancakes were one of a kind  moist and I loved the browned butter  The lemon curd on the lemon poppy seed pancake was amazing    On top of the food  their house coffee is very good and they make an awesome chai tea latte  My BF had the breakfast pot pie and also loved it  New go to breakfast spot when visiting Phoenix ,4,2018-09-18
Foods okay  service is not that good  We kept having to ask for drinks and utensils  The steak benedict is fatty ,3,2018-09-19
You are in for a treat here  It gets busy but the servers are wonderful   Try their snooze spuds breakfast plates   ,5,2018-09-23
First time here with our doggy and the experience was perfect   Since we live in Gilbert it was nice to try Snooze here      Very spacious and welcoming  Highly recommend the pineapple upside down pancakes   not too sweet either   Me and my fianc  had the eggs Benedict   There are lots of options soo just try what your feeling    you won t be disappointed or hungry afterwards       Thank you Mariam and team     And thank you Tony for bringing out our coffee        We will be back to visit,5,2018-09-23
  Let me start by saying I pretty much never write reviews  but I find it only fair to take the time to write a thorough review as to why my husband and I will absolutely recommend Snooze to anyone looking for a well run  fun and family friendly brunch spot   My family and I LOVE finding new brunch places every weekend and this weekend Snooze on Ray caught my eye so we gave it a try  Since moving to Phoenix we ve found that we either luck out big time and fall in love with a place or hate it    Snooze was without a doubt a  love  type of restaurant for us  I d say from the very start  checking in with the hostess  who were incredibly polite and sweet to hearing the totally reasonable wait time of    minutes given it was a Sunday morning with plenty of people waiting  As we were being seated our youngest daughter decided it was the perfect time to melt down  one of the wonderful ladies working went out of her way to bring our sweet girl some fresh fruit  My husband and I both agreed this alone scored the major points in our book    The menu is phenomenal  who doesn t love the option to pick   separate styles of eggs Benedict when a restaurant has so many yummy versions  Not to mention the drinks  both alcoholic and not were so much fun and such a great variety of the typical breakfast drinks to totally uncommon and unique to Snooze finds    As we ordered our waitress list off the different pancake choices to choose from for our daughter  As she read them the  pineapple upside down cake pancake  caught my attention  I obviously expressed interest in this delicious sounding pancake so much so that later they brought one out to us  How unbelievably kind is that    I think this has only ever happened to my husband and I while dining at five star restaurants    All and all our experience was impeccable  and though our youngest truly put up a good fight to allow us to enjoy our experience we still managed to walk away super pleased and happy  I fully attest this to the amazing service  feeling as though the individuals working truly cared which is so hard to come by these days  Looking forward to our next visit   ,5,2018-09-24
There is a very good variety in the menu  The food taste delicious  Some of my many favorites are the sweet potato pancakes and the hash brown cakes  Also for you vegetarians vegans out there  you might like to try the tofu scrambler with grilled veggies  It s all so scrumptious  And to top it off   the customer service is outstanding  warm and friendly like they want to be there and they want to serve  ,5,2018-09-25
I enjoy going to Snooze meeting friends for breakfast and today is one of those days   This morning the patio was inviting    cool breeze  quieter environment than the inside dining room    why not take advantage of early fall temperatures  It was a veggie taco breakfast for me  French toast and bacon for Jean and pancake and  sausages for Ron    My dish was ok  l didnt love it   The mixture of watered down scrambled eggs  pico de gallo  jack cheese  invisible green hollandaise and pretty much uncooked hash brown  call it  hash white  rather  didnt work for me    Jean s bacon looked on point and so did her French toast   Ron s pancakes looked large and dense  sausages looked great ,4,2018-09-26
My wife and I and friend of ours met for breakfast   My wife had Juan s Tacos which consisted of scrambled eggs  pico de gallo  cheese  and jalapenos  Our friend had half an order of French toast with a side of bacon and I had a stack of pancakes with a side of sausage  My wife thought her dish was just ok but not something she would order again  Our friend enjoyed her breakfast and my breakfast was fair at best  I expected the pancakes to be light and fluffy but they they were kind of thick and light or fluffy  Overall Snoize is very good place to go for breakfast   Their service is excellent   they have an extensive menu and they have a lively atmosphere  We ll be back but I ll pass on the pancakes ,4,2018-09-27
This was my favorite breakfast place in town  I come in about once a week and always order the same thing  I came in today and they had taken the Snooze Continental off of the menu  I m a picky person  I know  but without this on the menu I feel there s no good healthy BREAKFAST items  I dont write reviews like this often and what I did get was good  but this is my official petition to bring back my favorite breakfast ,5,2018-09-27
Thank you Snooze management for giving us a coupon to try the ray road location again  Katie  was an excellent serving and very engaging  The food was nicely presented and tasty to the palette  Thank you for inviting us back ,5,2018-09-29
So happy that they have a snooze like   miles from my house  We loved going to snooze in CA so I m super pumped it s so close  As always the food  service and atmosphere was great  I love their mugs too but I cannot justify spending     on one coffee mug    oh well  That s the only negative I can come up lololol,5,2018-10-04
Excellent food and even better service  We received a warm greeting from Brenda  perfectly made michelada s from Katie and top notch service with a smile from London  Pork green chili eggs benny s and sweet potato hash are my top recommendations  Oh and the pumpkin pancake is amazing ,5,2018-10-07
Our first experience with snooze was in California and I was thrilled when I saw that one was opening on Ray road  This place is pricey   it was almost    dollars for my wife and I to have breakfast here  I keep trying to defend this place to my wife because i like the spuds deluxe so much  So i got her to go again and of course her whole meal was cold when she got her food  She doesnt like to complain so she just dealt with it    The whole vibe of snooze is hippyish and snooty  They only give straws by request and when you get one its made of paper  In the bathrooms there is a device on the bottom of the bathroom doors so you dont have to touch the handle like a normal human being  Im surprised this place doesnt have a safe space in the back ,2,2018-10-08
Amazing experience  My   year old has a dairy and gluten allergy and the staff went over and beyond to keep him safe while still allowing him to eat what he wanted for breakfast  I called before going to Snooze and spoke with hostess Clarissa who was so kind and friendly  She went and asked the chefs my questions and ensured we could eat with the allergy restrictions  When we arrived we were greeted and seated  Tim our server came over immediately and was terrific  He took my sons allergies seriously and ensured his safety  Food came out promptly and delicious  I d highly recommend anyone who has food allergies sensitivities to visit this location ,5,2018-10-13
We are here pretty much every weekend  I love this place  The food is consistently good and they have breakfast cocktails  Customer service is good  sometimes the servers seem frazzled  but they always make an effort to be quick and attentive    All the dishes we have tried we have enjoyed  Some of our favorites include the breakfast pot pie  the benny goodman benedict  shrimp and grits  and the sunburst pancake   Great spot for brunch ,4,2018-10-14
Adorable place   We all agreed that the pumpkin pancakes were delicious but the sweet potato pancakes have no flavor   And the music is always just a bit too loud  I would come here more often  but if I m eating with people I want to converse at length with we don t come here ,4,2018-10-16
One of the best breakfast places I have been to in a long time  The atmosphere was very busy diner type  With indoor and outdoor seating  The wait was long but well worth it     minutes for a table of   on a Saturday morning is pretty standard for a place like this   The menu has a wide array of food items  very creative flavor combinations  They have a full bar Along with full espresso bar  so that s nice  Our server was nice and efficient we got our food quickly after we ordered   The food was amazing when it came out  Everyone in my party was very pleased with their food  I got the Havana daydreaming and it was AMAZING  And a coconut milk latte  I appreciated the milk alternative options  Overall  a great place ,4,2018-10-20
I ve been to Scottsdale and Gilbert locations  and thought I d try this one out too because I had heard there wasn t a wait because people didn t realize it was there yet  I had unfortunately been misinformed  That being said  the menu is the same as the other locations in the valley   but the service and food seems a little under the high bar that the other two locations have set  Perhaps I went in a little to soon after their opening  At any rate   best wishes to the new tukee location ,3,2018-10-21
Loud but better service and food than the Scottsdale location   Excellent French Toast,4,2018-10-27
This is the second time we tried this place and we should have passed it on by because the first visit was not that good  mainly due to service   Anyway  we came this week at lunch and was seated after they needed to clean a table   This was about    noon and I asked why the section next to us was closed off thought maybe they had a party   Could have been seated there quicker since the tables were clean   To my surprise they said they close off sections as it gets close to closing  sounds like a poor excuse to me   Maybe a ploy to make it seem busier than  it was   Anyway  the table next to us came in about the same time   We ordered our water which seem to take way to long to retrieve   We placed our order and the partner make a special request as to the type of cheese but nothing special on my end except that I asked for the eggs over easy   After what seemed like    minutes the waitress came back and said there was a mistake with the preparation regarding the cheese and they would correct it so it would take just a few minutes more   By the time our order had come out the table next to us had already left and to my surprise the eggs were scrambled   The waitress she would bring out the the correct eggs   As I took a bite I knew my order had sat for awhile as my partners order was  being fixed since the first bite was cold   And quicker than a flash they brought out the over easy but way too runny eggs   Suffice it to say I didn t finish the eggs scrambled or over runny   I really want this placed to be good but we just can t get past the poor service   Luckily the manager in charge comped the meal ,2,2018-10-27
We are huge fans of Snooze  The food is excellent   the bloody marys are great  and we have wonderful service every time we go  Today was no different  our server  Tim  was funny and personable  We would definitely request him next time we go ,5,2018-10-27
Excellent food  Crazy busy  ok service  The waitress forgot my husband s coffee towards the end of our meal and my water  Also needed refill on my ice tea again but didn t receive it  Another guest had soda that was flat  However the best blueberry pancakes I ve ever had and yummy ham Benedict III  They were friendly and the place was clean ,4,2018-10-28
Seriously the best breakfast spot I have ever been to  Fresh and creative food and tasty coffee   reasonably priced  There is something for everyone and their light dishes are just as flavorful as the regular items  The service is decent even though the place is packed from the moment it opens until it closes  and for good reason   A great place to take your out of town guest to also   You won t regret giving it a try ,5,2018-10-29
Great place  Love coming here for brunch with friends and family  Service is always awesome and everyone is super nice  Mariam  the manager  is top notch and does a great job running this place ,5,2018-11-02
Best  Breakfast  Ever  Breakfast burrito is off the chain  For real  it s probably against the law  lock that fool up  Go early  white people love brunch  Or honestly  just stay home and call it in  This place is silly  dumb good ,5,2018-11-04
Very tasty but extremely sweet food   You get a lot for the price  The burrito was enormous  The  pot pie  flaky  The variety of pancakes and French toast was great  They also have a wide variety of bloody mary and mimosa drinks  Servers were very friendly  Atmosphere a hip    s vibe  Outside seating  Delicious coffee  Environmentally responsible  I only took a star for extreme sugary sweetness ,4,2018-11-04
Very tasty  excellent service   A bit on the expensive side  but I ll be back   Wish they would close the doors  It s early in the morning and in the   s outside   I ll come back only if the doors are closed  It always either too hot or too cold ,4,2018-11-05
Excellent food  and possibly the best outdoor seating I ve ever seen  with great air conditioning and misters  A shame that the music is always way too loud  and the service is lackluster  Took over    minutes to get a drink  and even longer to get a refill after grabbing the waitress just to tell her I was empty  Overall  average  probably won t be back ,3,2018-11-09
Once you accept the fact that waiting   hours to get food is part of the  Brunch Experience  on a weekend morning  you ll be a much more content person  It took me a year but I ve finally learned that   hours will pass a lot faster if you treat yourself with endless mimosas while you wait   The food and drinks are excellent and the staff is friendly  My only issue with Snooze is the wait time  especially when it s hot outside and everyone is crowding under the shade ,3,2018-11-10
Snooze is always packed and super busy on Saturday and Sunday  I have never been during the week  but they must be doing something right  I have been a handful of times and usually get the same thing  breakfast tacos on flour tortillas with chicken sausage and jalape os added  The green chili hollandaise sauce is what makes the dish in my opinion    Today my husband and I shared two smaller items since we weren t super hungry    The breakfast pot pie  I first tried it years ago and it looks a little different now than it did then but still tastes great  I don t care for their hash browns  they aren t crispy enough    Pancake of the day  sticky buns  The pancake was really tasty  Cinnamon swirled with cream cheese frosting  with chocolate chips throughout and it was so fluffy   Our sever was kind and attentive  I don t like how long the wait is and how they blast the music but I think Snooze has become one of those  party breakfast  spots like Hash Kitchen ,4,2018-11-11
This place was hopping  I think the locals know about it  and out of towers find it on Yelp  We got there at      and only had a   minute wait for a table  At       when we left the wait was definitely longer  Food  drinks  and service were outstanding ,5,2018-11-11
I had the traditional French toast which was very good  Could ve been moister and more custard but very good and REAL MAPLE SYRUP  One reason I don t go out for breakfast is that crap corn syrup that is used  My husband had the Dutch blueberry pancakes  They were amazing  Filed with a tangy lemon curd and mascarpone  The side of hash browns were addicting  creamy middle crispy outside and chives  I had a hot chai  You could get it spicy or sweet  I got the spicy and it was delicious  Only thing I wish was different was the hours  They serve      am to      pm  I would personally go any time of the day  They do have cocktails and a nice savory selection of dishes which I will try next time  Prices were very good for quality of ingredients ,5,2018-11-13
The atmosphere was busy but tolerable  and the service was spot on  This is a must try   I order the shrimp and grits with xtra sausage and a morning mojito  Left the restaurant full and buzzed what a day   LOL,5,2018-11-18
What a great retro designed restaurant  Be prepared to wait since line was long but worth the wait  Pineapple upside down pancakes were delicious  We also had several other dishes and all were great  Will return ,5,2018-11-19
Love the vibe here as well as the service and staff  My only issue is that my food is always served luke warm at best  and this has been all three times that I have been there  Something is up with their burners or they are letting the food sit too long and is near cold by the time it gets to the customer  Once I see this change  I ll update my review to   stars  I hope management gets to see this  thanks ,4,2018-11-20
Finally got in here  Came for Saturday brunch  didn t have a long wait  Both inside and outside are great places to be seated  First off our server was great  Got to us quickly picked up our drink requests and explained the menu as needed  check out the seasonal cocktails  Yum    So many great options  I ended up getting the tofu scramble with my choice of three  flavor savors   My savors were of course veggies  My boyfriend stepped out of his box and got the Breakfast Pot Pie  For a meat eater it looked delicious  Warning on that item  If you are a traditionalist and thinking it will be a big plate of sausage and gravy it is not  It is gravy over a delicious puff pastry and an egg your style    While we had a couple hiccups from the kitchen the server resolved them quickly and had our food back out in no time    Tired of the standard  non creative breakfast menu  Come to Snooze  I very much recommend this place as one of the best places in Ahwatukee for breakfast ,4,2018-11-20
We feel that this is a good place for millennials and young folk  Call and book a table for the weekend  We like this place as it is close but also feel that it s a bit pricey for what is served ,4,2018-11-24
Awesome place  great food and great service        I loved the micheladas and our waiter was super nice and helpful ,5,2018-11-26
So I ve heard good things about this place so my wife and I finally got to check it out today  Wow the food was great and the drinks even better lol  We even got a complimentary cinnamon roll pancake  Service was very good too  My new favorite breakfast spot ,5,2018-11-27
I had the Peter Paul Ruben sandwich with a Brew Dr  Kombucha  The pretzel roll bun was SO good and the meat was nice and flavorful  Really enjoyed the kombucha too ,5,2018-11-27
Yes  they have an unusual menu   The service was just okay in terms of how long it took to get our food once ordered   The wait for a server to take our order was a bit longer than I would have hoped  but okay   My biggest complaint was the food   I ordered the house special omelet  which you customize for yourself  i e   any three fillings  veg or meat   I found the portions of the two meats and the jalapenos I ordered were quite miniscule  perhaps two tablespoons all together   If you are a breakfast meat lover  try a different restaurant   The price is right  though   Not expensive at all  ,3,2018-12-01
Like every Snooze that has come before it  this is a phenomenal breakfast place  I have been going to Snooze restaurants since they opened in San Diego  This is the only place I will order pancakes or hash browns from  Every other breakfast place the pancakes and hash browns are so bland  dry and boring unless you add syrup or ketchup    ugh  But at Snooze  oh man  it s a whole other world of experiencing breakfast  They make buttery  sweet pancakes and hash browns that are properly seasoned  it s so good   Their egg benedict s are fantastic and I love getting a flight of pancakes and trying different flavors  You can t go wrong with any Snooze restaurants  Oh  and on your birthday if you let them know  they ll send you a rainbow colored  donut shaped pancake with a candle ,5,2018-12-03
I had a poor experience here  Bad service and cold food  I didn t give a very good review  But I was convinced that it was just a bad server and it was  I ve been back several times and find it to be the best breakfast in the area ,5,2018-12-03
STOP THE PRESS  I need to live here  Seriously I am not even going to attempt to give a review because the English language has not come up with words worthy to describe the food  HEAVEN  Yes this is what it would be like to have a meal in heaven  Amen   ,5,2018-12-08
Love this place  The food is good  the staff are great but the wait times are insanity sometimes  I wish they took reservations because I hate wasting over an hour of my life waiting for a table,4,2018-12-12
Excellent selection of breakfast items to eat  clean and friendly The food is very tasty and fresh  Good Job,5,2018-12-16
Amazing    Well FOR SURE come back     in a few days  Highly Recommend this place   I always drove past it going to my regular routine places to eat SO GLAD this Sunday decided to try something new ,5,2018-12-16

This is a well deserved five star review  Fantastic  fantastic  fantastic  Why  Read on     Unheard of  but we had no wait time  Now  don t get me wrong  if there was an hour wait  it would be worth it  really  We sat right down in the super cool  hipster  comfortable  open  friendly atmosphere  Our server was super friendly and knowledgeable  outgoing  prompt and awesome  I was debating between two dishes and she immediately steered me in an incredibly delicious direction  She was in the money   Food  it s surprising how good the food is here  When you think you ve tasted just about everything and there isn t much new in breakfast cuisine to mix it up and happily surprise your pallet  this place will shock you with the most unique and delicious flavors of pancakes  eggs  breakfast meats  you name it  The food is super fresh  perfectly paired with spices and flavors  hearty  plentiful  beautifully prepared and served at the perfect temperature  The value is excellent for what you get  Might it be a couple dollars more than a standard breakfast chain  Yes  but truly worth every penny    The  Green Chili Eggs Benedict  was one of the best breakfast I ve had in years  honestly  As a creature of habit  I can t see why I wouldn t order that exact same thing for  well  the rest of my life  The true comfort food   grilled cheese and tomato soup   was stellar  Two of the girls got the  Ooh La La Frittata  and it was outstanding  Clearly John loved his breakfast tacos because they were gone in less than three minutes  Of course  The second he looked like he was slowing down  Jackie invaded his plate and destroyed one herself  soo good     Mimosas and Bloody Marys were A delicious way to wash a couple dishes down   Yes  there may be a wait for a table  there s a reason for it  this place is fantastic  I highly recommend it and am looking forward to returning  which I would do every morning over most other breakfast places without hesitation  Seriously  you should go put your name on the list right now  I hope you love it ,5,2018-12-25
When you arrive you will see a line    But it s for a reason    This place is awesome  The staff was awesome and helpful  We had the Benedict s and a hashbrown scramble  Espresso was excellent as well  Will definitely be coming back next time I m in town  We need one in Nashville ,5,2018-12-29
Saw a huge line the day before  Came today  totally worth it  First time here  Excellent bennys had ancient grains and chili verde with barbacoa  corned beef hash was amazing   Service  by Sam Chandler was outstanding  Super helpful with picking foods  Our son had the best hot cocoa ever he said ,5,2018-12-30
Service was friendly  However  restaurant was very noisy  they were busy   the food was cold when it arrived  the espresso drinks were VERY small given the Starbucks like price   In their defense they were very busy at the time  and when we subtly mentioned that there was a problem with the temperature of the food  a manager immediately jumped on that and offered to remake meal and said it would arrive very quickly  Turns out it did not arrive quickly  so they offered to package it up for us and also gave us coupon for a future meal and took the item off our check  They really did work hard to try to make things right but doubt  we will be using that coupon ,3,2018-12-31
You snooze  you lose  Hilarious  This is so awesome  Pancakes  Eggs  Milk   Juice  Lol,5,2019-01-11
Cold food for last   visits  Interesting that the Tempe location can serve fresh warm food  THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM  Management apologizes and comps the meal  which we don t want  we WANT HOT FRESH FOOD   I see you get a lot of business in south Phoenix but that will not last serving cold food   FYI  the person next to us had the same problem   Get it together   ,1,2019-01-12
A Snooze without the California attitude and the long waits  Man this place beat expectations  We arrived about  AM on Saturday and we were seated right away  try getting that lucky at a San Diego Snooze   The menu was pretty simple but there was something for everyone  I chose their signature hash  and sampled their burrito and a blueberry danish pancake  Everything was tasty and of high quality  Maybe it was the fact that this was in Arizona  but the prices were very affordable for a brunch restaurant      Get here before   AM     My hash was definitely true hash and not from a can   unlike some other brunch places   portion may have been a bit small    The kids pancakes were insanely delicious     Good coffee    Uncomfortable butt sliding retro chairs    Recommended when visiting Phoenix ,4,2019-01-16
Great food  friendly staff  and even friendlier manager  The food came out nice and hot and our server was very attentive  Manager did her rounds and said hi to our table and she was very nice and welcoming  Can t wait to come back and try a different dish and mixed drink ,5,2019-01-17
Came on a Saturday morning  Super busy but we were seated pretty quickly  Staff is always friendly and the restaurant seems to run smoothly on weekends even with tons of people eating  Food was fantastic  I try and get something new every time we go  Super kid friendly and accommodating for all party sizes  We will be coming back soon      ,5,2019-01-18
My family went to Snooze this morning for breakfast and it was about my  rd time going there  The food is always very good and they have good service  When we got there  the wait was only about   minutes to be seated  Today I got the huevos rancheros with eggs  Delicious   I love their hot chocolate as well ,5,2019-01-19
The Snooze on Ray in Phoenix is the best Snooze we have been to  We have been to others in the area but this one has by far the best service and the most friendly staff  The food is top class and even if your order comes back not as you prefer  they are quick to change it and ensure it is what you want  This is also the only place my wife is willing to try something new  since she is picky  because she knows everything on the menu is just as good  Also  can we talk about the pancakes of the day    Wow  We have never been dissapointed in our experience and will continue to go back for more  Thank you to the great staff and management for keeping this establishment fun and enjoyable  If you havent visited it  you are missing out  See you soon Snooze on Ray ,5,2019-01-22
Very tasty  excellent service   My server  Sam was FANTASTIC   Very nice young lady with a great attitude  who gave me a great recommendation   I will be back ,5,2019-01-25
Update from previous review  Definitely summed up in a word  redemption  Our server Rach C  was extremely attentive  apologetic if anything wasn t perfect  and a thousand times better than our last girl  The food was once again excellent  fresh  and value for money  only this time we could enjoy it because our server kept our drinks topped off  The music volume was still slightly a bit left to be desired  with very high bass levels  but for the most part  the restaurant was conversation loud which a restaurant has no control over  so that is acceptable  Once again  excellent interior and exterior  and fantastic outdoor seating  A great place for a Sunday lunch if you want a busy and popular hotspot  Thank you Snooze for the gift card and invitation to give you another chance  The gift card did not win us back  your servers performance and improved restaurant quality did that  We will return ,4,2019-01-27
Snooze is my go to for when we have guests come into town and we need somewhere for breakfast brunch lunch  The food is consistently good and their drinks are delicious  I love how they change the menu based on the season  I try to avoid weekends as the wait can be long  or send one person ahead to put in the name and find out the wait time ,4,2019-01-27
Without question the best breakfast eatery in the Galactic history of civilized beings   That s right  Sorry  Nfunretyrt Grill on Epsilon Indi    You have been bested    My lady and I discovered Snooze by chance one day and now make a monthly trip from Tucson to Phoenix to eat there  We try something different every time  and everything is good  Even my least favorite item on the menu is well above average    The breakfast pot pie is my current favorite  and they have an amazing array of pancakes  including seasonal and other specials    In addition  the atmosphere is fun  Very quirky and modern  It is clean and the service has always been top notch    Good news for you Tucson readers of this post  Snooze is coming to Tucson this fall   I believe on W Grant  but I m not completely certain ,5,2019-01-28
Came here for breakfast on a Monday morning and was sat very quickly  orders taken quickly  and the food came out quickly  I ordered the sweet potato hash with my egg over medium  I was quite impressed that my egg actually came out over medium   The bowl also had great flavor ,5,2019-02-07
We stopped by for a quick to go breakfast  Our food was ready quickly and it was still hot when we grabbed it  I got the hash with eggs  green onions  cheddar jack cheese  and the chicken sausage  The sausage is ground and seasoned well  YUM ,4,2019-02-12
Yelp reviews led me here and it did not disappoint  I was traveling alone and the staff were very friendly and offered great sight seeing advice  The menu was flavorful  I had a standard   egg scrambler and it was delicious  The hash browns were served as a patty which was unique  If it weren t for the fact that I was driving  I would have loved to try their boozy breakfast drinks  they all sounded great ,5,2019-02-16
This was our first experience at Snooze and we received exceptional customer service  Our order took    minutes to come out  after a    minute wait to be seated  However  the manager took the time to come by our table to not only apologize  but to also comp our order completely AND to give us a gift card to encourage us to come back  For a place that is not lacking business  they obviously value all their customers  Will definitely be returning for a second try  Thank you  Snooze ,5,2019-02-24
I ve been meaning to stop by Snooze cause their Camelback location always seems so busy  weekdays and weekends alike so when I found one in my neck of the woods  well  the stars have aligned   I stopped by with the in laws  the hubby was working  his loss   and though things were crazy busy  we were seated in    minutes  Our waitress was super helpful  knowing that it was our first time at Snooze  gave us a rundown of the menu  the crowd pleasers as well as her personal favorites of each category before giving us a chance to peruse the menu  I settled on the benny duo  steak   eggs benny and the bella bella benny  while the mother in law got a blueberry danish pancake and the father in law got the shrimp and grits  Let s just say  nobody was left unsatisfied with their choice  Our waitress even sent us a complimentary cinnamon roll pancake which just blew our socks off and sealed the deal   we were coming back  I guess the hubby can come next time ,4,2019-02-25
Granted  we went at a busy time  but the meal wasn t any cheaper for that and wow were there issues  First  there were all kinds of miscommunications between hostesses that further delayed the already  long wait  Then  the table was sticky and there were food bits here and there  Next  ordering took ages as our waitress appeared exasperated and unsure how to manage tables  The food took nearly another hour to arrive  Finally  worst of all  it was disgusting   The toast was either so stale it was basically biscote or it was just bread  Literally   none of us had actual toast  And everything was stone cold  Not tepid  not less than optimal  cold  Nothing was salted and the hashbrowns were funky tasting  like they d been sitting around for days  Nothing was on point  The one brightish spot was the bloody mary  though  some vodka would ve been nice  We were super disappointed because we had heard good things  We won t be back ,2,2019-03-03
Really great breakfast  they are definitely geared toward  hipster trendy crowd   The menu has something for everyone  even some healthy options   It s a do again  for sure ,5,2019-03-03
I usually never post reviews but I was really annoyed when leaving this restaurant  I ve eaten here before but didn t feel rushed to finish my food before  I get it  it was busy but don t give me my check    mins after we get our COLD food we re trying to enjoy our breakfast and their was only like a strip of bacon in my boyfriends breakfast thats great when we paid   extra dollars for it  I was going to order some more drinks and pancakes but i felt super rushed so we just left ,1,2019-03-03
Great food  great atmosphere and great service  We enjoyed breakfast egg sandwich on pretzel roll and breakfast pot pie  both delicious  Coffee was filled  food was hot and bathrooms were clean  We liked it so well we came back for a beermosa and michelado  They are open from   to      and it is worth your drive ,4,2019-03-06
As someone who goes to the tempe location often  we stopped by this location for breakfast today  The service was unreal  our server stopped by twice in the     hours we were there  Once the food arrived  after an hour  she didn t stop by to see how we were doing until we asked for the check  We will not be coming back,2,2019-03-11
I just had the most excellent light breakfast     Bravocado Toast     two small slices of whole grain toast  mashed avocado  a delightful tomato relish  perfectly prepared free range eggs  and a sugar free vanilla latte with a dash oh cinnamon     sooo satisfying ,5,2019-03-13
Really overpriced and not worth the wait  breakfast for   came out to nearly      Scramble wasn t as good as something I could just throw together at home  Pancake was good though  Poor service  water was empty the entire time  Coffee refills offered only once  The place looks nice inside  if that s important to you ,2,2019-03-16
Sorry to say we won t be returning to Snooze in Ahwatukee  It has a cute theme but the food was not good  I ordered poached eggs and they were so cold when they finally arrived that it felt like they had been in the refrigerator  Slow service   bad food   negative review  Sorry Snooze,1,2019-03-18
Love Snooze  We are in town for Spring Training and love stopping in before a game for creative breakfasts and friendly service ,5,2019-03-22
We had a lovely breakfast  The menu is amazing and there is something for everyone   The best past is every single server was happy and smiling and you can see they enjoy their profession of being a server   There are funky amazing pancakes   I had the sweet potato OMG    We also had juevos rancheros   which was way way above average   The banana pancake was to die for   We also had regular omelette   with fantastic fresh yummy eggs    GO HERE    Hash browns came like a little cake  crispy and super yum    We want to go back to try the grainy bowls and egg Benedict  looks Like their specialty     Up beat   Clean fresh ,5,2019-03-22
Good food  a basic breakfast spot  nothing extraordinary  Long waits on weekends  Very busy time frames can delay service  Decent prices ,3,2019-03-24
The service is very slow  They need more servers  it takes a while to take the order and don t check if you need refills or anything else  But they have the best pancakes I have ever tasted so most likely I will come back but not for other than that ,3,2019-03-30
The burrito was just plain crap  Too large  meat was so chewy  Drinks were terrible as well  Our server Erica was very nice though ,1,2019-03-31
This place is so loud on weekends  They desperately need something to catch the sound  Food is ok but nothing great  Mimosa was OJ with a splash of sparkling wine normally it s made opposite to this ,3,2019-04-05
I ve tried this place   times now  and at different locations around the valley and this is once again another mediocre experience  The food is just okay  There was nothing special about the pancakes or Spuds that we ordered   The table next to us found hair in their food   The service while nice  was bellow average  I finished my cup of coffee before the meal arrived and it wasn t till we were at the end of our meal that our waitress offered more coffee  And it s not as if she wasn t near our table  she was checking in constantly with the table that found hair  I ve given this place too many chances  It s just mediocre   There is nothing special  and I don t understand why it s always packed  There are better places in the valley to go too ,2,2019-04-12
Always delicious food and friendly service with good prices  Sometimes there is wait time on weekends or holidays but the food makes the wait worthwhile,5,2019-04-13
A little Side Car Bloody Mary action makes my life complete   We sat at the bar   no wait  that was awesome   The girls at the bar were super sweet   made my bloody perfectly spicy  extra olives   Thank you   Snooze is a national treasure   I love everything they do   I opted for the duo of benedicts because that s how I brunch   You should consider this as well  they are the best   Smashed avocado   lox were the perfect start to my Saturday   Me gusta   My date somehow charmed his way into a free maple pecan pancake  which I inhaled because you don t turn down a free pancake   Love this spot so much and looking forward to repeat visits ,5,2019-04-16
You must try the eggs benedict  I ve had every single combination and they re all delightful  So glad Snooze came to Ahwatukee   We needed a trendy  tasty breakfast brunch spot ,5,2019-04-17
Breakfast hit  Not traditional but an experience I would definitely try again  If you want a great breakfast joint were you will be satisfied  Seriously  stop in and prices are reasonable ,5,2019-04-23
I stumbled on this place    Didn t know It was in my neighborhood  Tucked away in a Big Maze Of Box Stores     Had the best oatmeal  Yum Yum   Very Colorful Decor As Well  ,5,2019-04-27
The selection was great  I do wish they had options that include the meal of pancakes  bacon  eggs  The kitchen must have been backed up when we got there because it took    minutes and wasn t hot when it came out  The manager did notice and fixed the issue  The customer service by the host and wait staff is excellent   Yummy in our tummy ,5,2019-04-28
Great place for brunch and cocktails  The spicy Bloody Mary was great  I had the best peanut butter cup pancakes ever ,5,2019-05-06
This place does not do a good job with food  hospitality or anything w r t customer hospitality  Idiots had a lot of tables open and made me wait for    mins before they can let us sit and then good comes in    mins after which was terrible ,1,2019-05-11
I really thought this place was good  Even though there is a way  the check in system is through text messaging  which is excellent  The OMG French toast was indeed OMG  I love that they have all the calories laid out so I could pick something that wasn t too bad for me  My only complaint was that the decaf coffee was lukewarm each time we got it ,4,2019-05-21
Just like the other   Snooze I have visited   Outstanding   All the eggs benny are excellent but I have a hard time not ordering the corn beef hash with poached eggs   Also their servers are amazing   An excellent experience always ,5,2019-05-21
We love coming to snooze and come frequently  Unfortunately  today s experience was not great  We only had a waiter for ordering  We were never checked up on for refills or asked how the meal was  Normally this isn t necessary for us but we both ordered eggs Benedict and the yolks were completely hard  We would have asked for them to be remade but ended up eating them because a waitress waiter never came around  We came at a steady time  however there were plenty of staff around  We are pretty disappointed and it was not the normal experience we usually have at snooze   ,2,2019-05-24
Visited on a weekday for breakfast  I had the ham benedict III  The benedict was very good but the hash browns were awful  Maybe the worst I ve ever had   What passes for hash browns are soggy  lukewarm  bland  cakes of shredded potato  They may have been cooked earlier and then microwaved  The format is clearly for the convenience of the kitchen  not the enjoyment of the customer ,2,2019-05-26
This place has the most delish eggs lox Benedict    service was awesome   definnetly one of my fav   pic resturants,5,2019-06-01
Have been here a few times with family or business breakfast and each time have had a great experience  Service is fast and friendly  food is delicious and fresh  Enjoy their coffee too    Sat on the patio and inside  both good vibe  Price is a little high for breakfast but food is full of flavor so don t mind the extra price     For a breakfast spot  you gotta try them ,5,2019-06-08
We arrived today around        took about   minutes to be seated as it was pretty slow  Recd our drinks but waited quite sometime for the server to return to take our order  It took aprox      minutes to get a classic breakfast    eggs over easy  bacon  hash browns and toast  really       minutes   I had to ask someone to see if our order was in or if she forgot to place our order  As soon as he went in the back to check  the server came out with our food stating that she had put in our order immediately  that seems kind of strange when a family of   was seated well after us and received there food before I even asked someone to check on ours  She forgot or took her time to put it in  if you made a mistake  fine  we all do  but own it  don t lie                           Now onto the food  my eggs were really runny and my husband was served food on a dirty plate  Yes  it was dirty  when he pointed it out  the server said oh it looks like blueberries  we did not order blueberries  We walked out at         wasted an entire hour there  A woman stopped us on the way out  maybe a mgr  and offered to remake the food but at that point we were done  After waiting that long for the food to arrive that didn t look appetizing and served on a dirty plate we were pretty much disgusted  I waited the day to write this as I was pretty upset earlier  I am no less upset by the matter several hours later  Do yourself a favor and go to  Butters  in Scottsdale  good food  served within a reasonable time frame on clean plates ,1,2019-06-09
I love this place   Of course I love this place every time I come in   For example  today the kitchen forgot to make a substitution on my order   Our server  Kendall  smoothly and quickly corrected the order   I cannot remember a server correcting an order so quickly in my life  She was awesome ,5,2019-06-09
A great local find when in the area  Like many of the reviews I found this place to be high quality  local  fast  and friendly  Huevos Rancheros were prepared well and I added a side of green chili  since I am an addict   Morning on the patio was great too  Fast  courteous  and attentive service  Very diverse breakfast menu  Great  goto  for breakfast ,5,2019-06-10
Have loved everything about Snooze   until today   Visited with a friend and couldn t have been more disappointed     While the greeter and server were pleasant  the service was beyond s l o w   It took almost an hour to get our food and when it arrived  it was cold   Had to request a coffee refill and was charged for it   No apology for the delay  even though we observed the servers visiting in the corner    While the food was decent  it was nothing special   After an excruciatingly long wait  we would have expected our food to be warm and delicious  It wasn t  And  it was     for two people  not including the tip  yes  I reluctantly tipped    Am I going back   Nope ,1,2019-06-11
I was treated to breakfast today by a friend who told me Snooze is a great place to eat   I was very excited to try a new restaurant  However  the service was non existent the waitress spent most of her time chatting in the corner with staff   After taking our order the waitress disappeared   It took over    minutes to get our food which was only warm   During this time we never saw the waitress and no apology for the long wait  The restaurant was not busy probably one third full   Needless to say  I will not return ,1,2019-06-11
Was feeling ravenous this morning after an eventful weekend and crashed into Snooze  Was pleasantly awakened by an incredible plate of their OMG French Toast  Incredibly rich and creamy flavor on fluffy brioche toast  topped with coconut flakes  what tasted like coconut milk  and strawberries  Oh and you can t forget the powdered sugar   The beauty of getting up and eating so early of course is the heat isn t quite blistering yet so having breakfast on the patio was a beautiful addition to the already warm staff   servers    Loved every minute of it  Keep in mind portions are huge  Even if you come in hungry  Super cute restaurant and will definitely be coming back   ,5,2019-06-17
Had a terrible experience here   Some of the worst breakfast food I ve had  The service was bad and it took forever  I ll give that a bit of a pass because it was super busy on a Sunday    The food was inexcusable  I got the salmon and latkes benny and my friend got the pineapple upside down pancakes  My salmon was too salty  the hollandaise was bad  and the hash browns on the side were formed into a puck   while visibly appealing  meant that the entire inside was not browned  As for her pancakes  they were tough and tasted burnt  I ended up having to douse them in maple to make them edible because she couldn t stand them  Her iced tea was some of the worst I ve ever had  It was worse than McDonald s tea    It s overpriced for shitty food  I regret not going to the IHOP across the street ,1,2019-06-23
Wow    As vegans  we had so many great food options to choose from  Our server was amazing and helped us to show options  She also let the kitchen know we were vegan so the grill area was taken care of    Thank you Melissa  Not only did you help with choices and options available but the refills on coffee and almond milk are appreciated    Great food  Beautiful presentation  Amazing service  We will return ,5,2019-06-27
Service was ok but slow and she never checked up on us for refills    My egg white omelette was disgusting and the butter had to be soaked up with napkins   I like the service and food better at the Gilbert location ,2,2019-07-05
Visit this location on a Saturday noon  Lots of people waiting but got a table ready in    mins  Then another    mins wait for food   Food is good  service is not  Waiter walks and talks like no soul inside  Carry out will be better option ,3,2019-07-06
Best breakfast in Phoenix  I always get a pancake and the Sandwich I Am  The hollandaise sauce is the best ever ,5,2019-07-07
Going to Snooze was always a must for me when visiting Denver and San Diego  As a new Phoenix resident  I was excited to find out I had a Snooze AM nearby  This location did not disappoint and I m excited to have a go to location when I want a breakfast burrito smothered in green chili or a unique plate of Eggs Benedict   The option to do a flight  two different  Benedict s is my favorite option ,5,2019-07-10
The food is amazing  always fresh and delicious  The service is always great and cheerful  I love their interesting  ever rotating pancake of the day  Even their hashbrowns are something special  Server Marissa in particular is not only a great server but also truly kind  We ve tried so many different things and everything has been fantastic ,5,2019-07-12
K  so I kept driving by this place on my way to Modern Market  I gave into my curiosity and stopped in for brunch  Good decision    Atmosphere  loud  But cute  It s all diner esque     Service  meh  The hostess was timely and personable  I like that there s a texting system to notify you of when your table is ready  Waitress could use a lesson from hostess on being personable  Also  I m not a fan of servers who don t provide refills and bring the check without asking if you re ready for it   Food   Shhhhh   Listen  Do you hear that  It s angels singing  Not only are they singing but they are also playing air guitar and head banging   I had the Lox n Latke Benny  which gave me a taste gasm  It was the perfect mix of salty and crispy and egg Benedict y  Haha  Yw   I also had regular cup of joe  which was ok  Then I tried the AM Manhattan    omg  the lead singer of the angel band just busted a high note  It s that awesome  The cherry on top of the drink made it a perfect balance of sweet and bitter    The menu is pretty impressive  I do hope that whoever created and executed this menu is somewhere far away on a yacht enjoying the fruits of their creative labors  cuz they totally deserve it    Prices are probably a dollar or two too high on the entrees  but since the food was so delish  I don t mind paying a little extra  I mean  angels sang  soooo    Get in your car now  and go to Snooze  You ll be in heaven ,4,2019-07-14
Well I want to start off by saying this is best best breakfast spot in the valley  Seated quickly  service was great  but my god the food  It was on point  I had the breakfast pot pie and it was  to simply put it amazing  My fianc  ordered a flight of pancakes  Yes  that s right a flight  A great place for breakfast or lunch  I highly recommend ,5,2019-07-14
It was my first time here  after a   hour flight  I wanted to eat a good breakfast lunch   We waited for about   minites to be seated   not bad    servers were friendly and polite   Food took about    minutes to arrive and when it finally arrived  plates slipped out of the servers arms and my orders fell flat on our table  Thank goodness I didn t get any food or beverages on me and the plate didn t break  Server was apologetic and we understand  things happen  Another server came and apologized  sat us at another table and made sure we were alright  I stated my concern that we will have to wait for another    or so minutes for our food to come out  She assured us that our order is priority and will be out soon  While waiting  another server came out   I think a manager   and advised that he heard what happened and apologize  He offered me something to eat while waiting for my meal  i asked for a bowl of fruits  and stated that my food will come out soon  Food came out  I loved the OMG French Toast   Yummy  Definitely must try   Our bill came out and they only charged us for one meal  They didn t have to do that  but they did  Kudos to the management   I will come back again and give it another try ,3,2019-07-19
Worse service ever  The girls who work there awesome  The manager is awful     I had hair in my food  I was missing my vanilla latte and the manager couldn t even help me  I will never ever ever ever go to this place again    Was my favorite place to go but will never go here again  Manager was beyond rude ,1,2019-07-20
Amazing service given by Kendall  She was so friendly and kind  Love this girl and hope the next time we stop in we can sit in her section  Thank you so much for wonderful food and fantastic service    ,5,2019-07-21
Charged for a huge side of salsa when it originally came with it on the burrito  I just asked for a side of it instead of  on the burrito  I paid cash  but because they don t carry  quarters  I wasn t given my change ,2,2019-07-26
Love the place the problem I have is I ALWAYS wait at least    or    minutes to called but the one time I drove separately from my kids there s wasn t much wait they wouldn t give me a table until my kids arrived which they were at turtle speed   that is terrible terrible service  Uncalled for          I ve had friends wait for me in past they had no problem   s,2,2019-07-28

I cannot say enough about how fantastic our breakfast was at Snooze   I had the Chili Verde Benedict and it was amazing  I always love to try specialty eggs Benedict at eateries during my travels  but now I m super excited to have a place close to home with fantastic varieties of my favorite breakfast ,5,2019-08-12
Today I stopped by here for a pickup order and had such a horrible experience with the staff  I was told it would take    mins for my pickup order and after waiting    mins my food still wasn t ready  I asked for a refund being that I needed to head to work and was now running late  the staff was rude about it  It took almost    mins for a basic refund followed by a rude comment of  oh well here comes your food  too bad you won t be getting it since you want your refund  and a lot of rude eye rolling by both employees I interacted with  I typically love coming here before work  I always call ahead and grab my food on my route to work but luckily there are many other places I will be replacing this restaurant with ,1,2019-08-17
The food was delicious and perfectly portioned  The fruit was fresh and Abri ca lav ra mimosa is my new favorite morning cocktail ,5,2019-08-21

I usually always go to the Gilbert location and this location is such a let down  Always something wrong with the food  Cooked very different than the gilbert location even though its the same company  Been here twice and it is currently blacklisted ,1,2019-08-28
My ultimate favorite breakfast place  When I have family and friends come into town  we go there the very next day  Friendly workers  beautiful set up and bar  delicious food with a good variety too ,5,2019-08-30
STOP THE PRESS  I need to live here  Seriously I am not even going to attempt to give a review because the English language has not come up with words worthy to describe the food  HEAVEN  yes this is what it would be like to have a meal in heaven  Amen ,5,2019-09-02
Yummy breakfast for both of us  We tried the pancake flight  delicious  Their egg dishes are very good and the service was great  Will try again next time we are in the area ,5,2019-09-03
Great food and great service   I love this place for early breakfast with a great location close to ASU,5,2019-09-17
Tasty Food  Great Service  Cool Atmosphere    I like the funky feel of this place  It s like old school and modern collide into an explosion of interesting decor and good music    The service is awesome here  It seems like they rounded up all the nicest people and hired them from everywhere else  Good job hiring manager    The food is quite wonderful here  from Peach pancakes  to delectable skillets  It would seem after my     visits here that there hasn t been any negatives from my experiences so far here    I feel like I need to take more pictures and post more details after my next visit to do this place better justice    Stop by and get yourself a tasty belly full of goodness ,5,2019-09-19
Where are the vegan options people are mentioning  Besides vegan sausage and tofu  I want vegan pancake options  Vegan French toast options  Best atmosphere  best drinks  now we just need better vegan options ,4,2019-09-30
I usually go to the Snooze in Gilbert  I have always had a great experience there  I drove by this Snooze so I thought it d be safe and I d have the same experience  First of all  service was SOOOO slow  My server came over almost    min after I was sitting  Then my hot tea took another   minutes to get to me  When I got my food  Benny Duo  it was cold and the poached egg was super slimy  I asked my server if I could have another one in its place and the manager came over and didn t believe me when I told her the egg was slimy  As if to say I don t know what a poached egg is supposed to look like  I finally got a new avocado Benny and then I had no silverware  I had to flag a server down that wasn t my own  I never got a refill of hot water for my tea and there was absolutely no follow up from the manager  Needless to say  I will not be visiting this Snooze again ,1,2019-10-10
My family and I were visiting AZ  Ended up eating here twice  The food was delicious and the environment was efficiently hip and delightful  I had the Benny Duo where you get to select   of the Benedict s from the menu  I chose the Chile Verde w  Barbacoa and the Avocado Smashed Benny  They were both wonderful  Oh  and to wrap it all up  the service was incredibly dynamic and genuine  We don t live here  but once a year  we can definitely guarantee that a visit will be listed in our trip s itinerary ,5,2019-10-14
Walked in at  am on a Sunday and had problem getting seated right away  Our waitress was nice and the Service was on par  Still dreaming about Juan tacos and how good it was  Can t wait to come back ,5,2019-10-18
i love this place  i eat here at least     times a month and i have never been disappointed       percent recommend ,5,2019-10-22
Pancakes make for perfect days  Snooze does such a great job setting the stage with their cuppacino s  Bloody Mary s or mimosas to then lead you down their path of pancakes  The most difficult decision is the flavor to choose    Today s was a simple   pancake day  sweet potato with mixed berries on top  It was the perfect level of sweetness  Three  the normal helping order  would have been enough for three people  They are huge    Loved sitting in their  inside outside booth  that was next to the massive garage door that was open to let the fall cool air in    And the puppy patio already had several cute pups out there    This place is awesome ,5,2019-10-26
We love to have breakfast at Snooze  especially this time of year when we can enjoy the patio  Our meals  prepared with locally sourced ingredients  are consistently delicious and attractively presented  with great seasonal offerings  As an added bonus  the efficient   personable staff bring smiles to our faces and add to the dining experience ,5,2019-10-27

Love coming here  and now I have   more reasons  Snooze has switched to paper straws  Yay for the environment  yay for Snooze  My second reason  We arrived on a Sunday to a busy restaurant  and needed a table for    but the hostess was originally told    When we corrected our mistake with them  they told us it would be another    minutes  The manager then came out to tell us that there was a table inside if we didn t want to wait  We hemmed and hawed on a decision because we could see a table on the patio was almost finished  Finally we decided on the inside table  The waitress then gives us a complimentary plate of   yummy pancakes because of the mixup  Mixup  We were the ones that messed up  Great service Snooze  ,5,2019-11-03
We love snooze we come here a lot I mean a lot    We always order the  same thing   still expect lines but worth the wait  we come by ourselves we bring our kids never a disappointment until the last time he came and we had a waiter that wasn t too friendly    It was my husband s birthday I asked if they do anything like a pancake  and he kind a looked at me like no we don t do anything and even said we don t do it but I ll make a exception this time  i told him I ll pay for it even  then I looked around other people had pancakes with candles in it he did make it very awkward but he did bring something of his choice out  because at that time everyone at our table felt awkward   I did ask up front about it while waiting and they said they definitely do that  I m just saying it s always a great place for food sometimes depends on who you get might be just a staff person    Maybe he didn t now I don t know this won t stop us from coming back  food is great  just weird that day   thumbs up for food  half way thumbs up on the experience again it won t stop us  we will take the good with the not so good    that s why   stars   ,4,2019-11-03

Great breakfast spot with outdoor seating   We found the staff to be extremely accommodating   they gladly made adjustments to what was offered on their extensive menu   The food was extremely well prepared with fresh ingredients   We went back the very next day  and look forward to breakfasts during future visits to PHX ,5,2019-11-11
Love place  Ate brunch here today on the dog friendly patio and the Juan s Tacos are my favorite  ,5,2019-11-14
Snooze is one of my favorite breakfast spots  I came in here with my mom early Friday morning  We showed up right when they opened at     am  It s nice and quiet at that time  and there were only     groups there    We both ordered items from their  lighter fares  menu  I ordered an egg white omelette with cheese  spinach  and pico  They brought the pico out on the side  The omelette was good  Their hash browns are one of a kind  Cooked well and full of flavor    If you aren t going on a work day  try one of their boozy drinks ,4,2019-11-24
Sorry snooze  Atmosphere is awesome  Patio is perfect  Service was good   Food     not so much  Mixed up the drinks  Brought the wrong food and my kid had to wait for it to be remade  It was all mediocre  They charged us for both the wrong and correct order  To top it off  and I didn t know this until after I left and double checked the menu  they put raw fish on my avocado toast  It was supposed to have caramelized onions and tomatoes and because of the egg on top I didn t notice  I thought I had missed it on the menu so I didn t say anything  By this time we had already complained  But in fact they made it totally wrong  I only ate     bc some fell off and I saw what I had thought was caramelized onion  I ve never had fish  and for a reason      meal that was wrong  Kitchen was way off today    not going back ,2,2019-11-24
I ve been here a few times  Food is good and the service is okay at best  This last visit was probably my final straw however  My daughter and I came in today  were seated and sat a full    minutes without even being acknowledged by a waiter at all  Meanwhile  at least   waiters were meandering around  two chatting over in the corner  We finally walked out  Trust me  that went unnoticed  too  Lol I ll be giving my business elsewhere ,2,2019-12-09
