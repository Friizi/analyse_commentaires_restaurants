The food was GREAT  We like the look also  But some of the waitstaff could use some customer service   communication  We were seated      min later we were brought water  Then asked if the girl who brought us water took our drink order  which they did not  Once our order was placed  the food wasn t long after  Being that i saw the kitchen staff standing   talking  But other than that  it was good ,3,2015-03-05
The lobster roll was so yummy I actually finished the whole thing  Had a bite of the sliders my girlfriend ordered and it was also very tasty   My fianc  ordered the prime beef  he didn t enjoy it as much as he has hoped   It was a little bland and chewy  Standard quality cocktails  nothing to write home about  Overall satisfactory dining experience ,4,2014-05-08
We shared the lobster roll and pastrami sliders  Side order of duck fat French fries  Needed to get rolled out of there but worth every calorie  I like the casual and friendly atmosphere  This is a very fun place with an impressive beer selection   I could see spending an afternoon trying beer and special treats  Ohhh   lobster rolls    ,5,2012-07-17
This is a great gastropub  In general  restaurants in Vegas are pricey  and I feel do not frequently deliver in quality  This place is certainly an exception  Well priced and food is delicious  Servings are large and savory  Junk chips appetizer was tasty and filled me up in less than a quarter of serving  I shared lamb pita and lobster rolls with my friend  and both were excellent and filling  Service was also outstanding  waitress was friendly  attentive  and helpful  Food was served relatively fast too  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a solid reasonably priced dinner in Vegas ,5,2015-11-06
The food has huge portions and was overall  REALLY good   The pretzels were perfectly cooked on the outside and soft on the inside with a delicious cheese  and the mussels with thai red curry sauce were AMAZING   The burger we got was mediocre  though    I think the flavors were really really lacking  and the beer was pretty expensive      for a Belgian ale    However  this is still a pretty perfect meal after a long night out   just skip the burger ,4,2015-07-28
My favorite place to visit for a pint and appetizers while in Vegas ,5,2014-05-26
I want to like this place more   and maybe I will as I try more of the menu     I love the the actual space and atmosphere   And the beer list is quite good   The service is sometimes great and sometimes poor   Its varied pretty wildly   I have yet to be blown away by any of the food   None of it has been bad   in fact  it has all been good   But none of it has been great   None of it has been crave worthy   None of it has been  I have to have that again  ,3,2010-11-23
Great experience  A little pricy but well worth it  I got the Prime Rotisserie Sandwich       my wife for the P U B Reuben       both were great but the Reuben was out of this world  Both could come down in price      but still worth it  The waiter we had was super awesome and entertaining  Stig was his name  Bald head and long beard  Hope you get him ,5,2017-09-20
Bathroom attendant   Oh God   And the worst kind   the ones that immediately offer you soap and paper towels as you try to do the usual handwashing process   No  you don t care how my day was  and I don t care how your day was   I just want to use the damn bathroom after my meal without having to deal with some unisex bathroom attendant   Beer prices were among the highest on the strip but the selection was good in quality for how many they had   Even though other places had more taps  like the pub at Monte Carlo   this place seemed to have a more diverse selection of styles   regions   Very clean  pleasant atmosphere   Service was pleasant   Nice shopping area too   But please lose the bathroom attendant ,3,2010-10-06
This place rocks   Here s the short list after eight separate visits with multiple guest and trying almost the entire menu       For starters   the clams or P E I s  Perfectly cooked with a bit of spice       The pot pie and Shepard s pie are incredible       Carvery is the winner   Brisket is top choice   Salmon is perfect choice for the fish lover   Perfect crispy skin and moist in the middle       Beer   make it the TUB   Locally brewed in LV   Very well balanced with the food at the PUB   All around fun and cool place to enjoy lunch   Try the beer challenge and enjoy tossing the peanut shells on the ground at the bar while you wait for your food   Must try ,4,2010-11-23
Came here for some lunch as we got a recommendation from the hotel staff   As you walk into the establishment  between Aria Hotel and Crystals   it looks as though I ve stepped into a British pub in England   Clean and nice decor     We review the menu and was told that there was a lunch special           which included BBQ Ribs  Brisket along with cole slaw and baked beans   The special also includes a beer   We decided to try it as it seemed like a decent deal to share for the two of us   The brisket was very good as there was a lot of flavor and it was really  really well cooked   The ribs were alright  although the barbeque glaze on top of the ribs was really strong    The cole slaw was good and light  but the beans to me were really sweet     a little too sweet for me   All in all  it was a good experience  although I would definitely like the opportunity to try the Fish and Chips next time I m in Vegas ,3,2012-05-29
I was excited to try this place but the food just wasn t that good  Trust me  I really want to like this place  With that said  it s a fun pub and we went back for beers again  They do have really good service but the food is overpriced and terribly mediocre  Also  basic beers are at least     a pint  I know this is Vegas but c mon  A Fat Tire is      You gotta be kiddin  me ,2,2011-04-29
Came here for happy hour  The selection of food for happy hour is mediocre  wings  oysters  and sliders pretty much  but the half off draft beer is a winner  They have a large selection of craft beers and when you get there for happy hour they come out to be between     instead of        The one salad we had was pretty tasty and plentiful  but spendy for a salad   I don t know if I would come here outside of happy hour  but you never know when you re in Vegas anything goes ,4,2013-07-03
Stopped in here for lunch  Obviously a really great location if you re staying in the area of Aria  It s a good option for something a little more casual  as a lot of the other options in and directly around the casino are more upscale   With it being right on the walkway from Aria towards the mall and Cosmo beyond  it s a solid place to watch the crowd go by  which in Vegas  can always be entertaining    The P U B   Public Urban Bar  has  as one would expect and hope  a pretty outstanding selection of beers  both on tap and in bottle  We were served by the barkeep very promptly  and as we were fairly starving after a long flight  it fortunately did not take long to get our food   I tried the Buffalo Style Burger which was served with blue cheese  hot sauce and slaw  Really outstanding  Their fries were great too    At     for a burger  it s definitely on the pricier side  but what else would you expect right outside the casino door  If I get the opportunity  I ll head back here for some more brews and snacks  though I d probably try to hit up the happy hour to keep the cost contained ,5,2014-03-08
  Star Lunch  Great service  food and drinks  I had the grilled cheese with bacon and fries  others had  lobster roll  fish and chips  chill  clam chowder  BBQ chicken lettuce wraps and lots of great drinks  Food  drinks and the service were awesome ,5,2015-12-31
Pie Glorious Pie   I went here with one sole purpose  Shepherd s Pie  Get in my Belly  It was my first Shepherd s Pie and will definitely not be my last  Delicious flavors and great service  Beer menu is quite robust and the prices aren t too bad for being in the heart of City Center  Would go back ,4,2013-08-22
Meh      Maybe I need to give it another shot  but I wont do that until someone else pays for it  lol Too expensive for some meh   ,2,2013-07-16
Had a really nice brunch on Memorial Day Sunday while watching the end of the Indy        We ve eaten at Todd English s Olives in the Bellagio    this is good too  but nothing like Olives  either ambience or food selection   But  it is an archetypical  pub    sports bar   They were running a Corned Beef Hash special with asparagus   hollandaise and a brunch drink special on Mimosas and Bloody Marys  Great food  good bread to start with  decent sparkling wine in the Mimosas    Great service   Definitely will go back    the rest of menu looked great for an easy lunch or dinner place while in the City Center area ,4,2011-06-19
This is a very fun place  loud and vibrant as you expect in Vegas  a great vibe all around   So it s an English style pub this means one important aspect to start out with   beer   I had the arrogant bastard ale  which for some reason I suspect may have been the wife telling me something subconsciously but it seemed to hit home  Very smooth and refreshing   The beer was pretty good too   The wife had a Bloody Mary chock full of add ons to ensure optimal obnoxiousness was achieved  Cheddar  shrimp  salami  pickled asparagus  old bay seasoning  Worstershire sauce  lime juice  spicy V  all made full with tomato basil infused Vodka   A drink as large as a five course meal  whatever next   She loved it   Well next in fact was the crispy beer battered pickles as an appetizer   Appetizer   This could be a whole meal for   on its own   Great dips with this   Awesomeness   Entree  fish and chips   it s an English pub what else   Also we shared and good thing  this could feed a family of     Fish  fries  coleslaw as good as it gets   phenomenal   Service was also awesome  our server was incredibly friendly and helpful   So great place and a well earned   stars ,5,2014-09-27
Based on some of the reviews I don t know what exactly I was expecting however I was very pleasantly surprised  Although it is a little hard to find right outside of aria and in the crystals shopping center  The restaurant itself is actually very well decorated and has a cool hip vibe     Really extensive beer list and decent prices on pitchers   Expect upscale pub food and really think about getting something from the Carvary      I got the openface pastrami which was to die for pair it with the mustard trio and the curry butter and you will be very very happy ,4,2014-08-21
    stars  This is a pretty laid back place right next to Aria   Gotta love those pub height tables with your very own tap   Awesome   There s a great beer selection and if you re at the bar and are up for a challenge you can chug your beer in   seconds and get it for free   I guess that s cool if you think chugging a good beer is worth it     When you sit at a table you get a small tin of popcorn to snack on   The food is good but I think the whole thing is a bit overpriced   Happy hour is pretty decent  good deals on beer and appetizers  although if you ask me the price of happy hour apps are probably the price they should be normally    Good outdoor seating for those nice days     I won t be here regularly but when I wind up here for a beer it s usually a good time ,4,2013-05-10
Great spot  Solid food  One of the best beer menus in Vegas and bartenders that are knowledgeable and accommodating  Kris and Jaime were fantastic  Knowledgeable  accommodating  a lot of fun  When in Vegas  don t miss this spot ,5,2014-12-17
My husband and I have eaten at almost every fancy schmancy restaurant in Vegas  and there are quite a few of them  During our most recent trip last week  I found out that Todd English P U B  was rated at a top    restaurant  bar in the US  As an avid fan of Crystals in general  I decided to give it a try for my birthday dinner  Plus my dad was paying and I didn t want to run him dry right before retirement with a trip to Mastro s  We were able to make a reservation for    same day  for      pm  The hostess seated us promptly in a large  comfy booth  Instead of bread they immediately provide fresh popcorn  yum   Our server was very sweet and even hand stuffed my husband s blue cheese olives for his dirty martini  I opted for a ginger beer cocktail and was not disappointed  It was served ice cold in a tin mug   For a starter  we ordered    of the east coast oysters  They were served with fresh horseradish  mignonette and chili sauce  I ve had quite a few oysters in my day and these were AMAZING  For entrees  my husband ordered the sliders  standard  and I chose the lobster cobb salad  The salad was loaded with lobster meat  but they forgot the dressing  It would defeinitely have added some flavor  My dad is Irish  so I convinced him to order the bangers and mash for his entree  Oh   my   lord  The onion gravy was divine  My step mom s fish and chips were also delicious  but could have done without the slaw    Vegas needs more restaurants  bars like Todd English P U B  We will definitely return  but most likely just for the oysters and drinks  They don t do birthday surprises either   ,4,2013-07-11
Bad food and expensive beer  The fries were way too salty and pretzels were super greasy  Won t come back ,2,2014-02-28
Food is decent  nothing super fancy  Huge beer selection  Excellent server  Extremely friendly and accommodating  Great place to come for snacks and drinks ,4,2015-04-12
We ordered the famous Bloody Mary and were disappointed  Don t waste the        The lobster rolls were delicious     The filet breakfast was tiny and would not recommend  Great atmosphere ,3,2015-09-20
We were here on a Saturday evening around     pm  and we were told that there would be a    minute wait  We were okay with that  but as we walked to the bar there were a TON of empty tables    Why would there be such a long wait just for two   Anyway  we found a table at the bar to sit in and have dinner  We shared the mini corn dogs  Dirty Chips  and the bison burger   The corn dogs were good  The Dirty Chips were pretty fantastic  It was a huge appetizer for the two of us  Between the corn dogs and chips  we didn t need the bison burger   The bison burger was dry  We ordered it medium rare  and it lacked juiciness   The service was good and the atmosphere was nice too ,3,2011-03-23
Best fries in Vegas    Chicken sandwich was to die for and the ranch killed it  Aria is amazing also and if you haven t shopped in the crystal shops you should  Expensive tho ,5,2018-01-09
Maybe the only place that closes in Vegas  Todd English opens at   am   a miss for those in search of morning pub fare as an alternative to the traditional Vegas brunch options   Raw bar is very good  with the lobster cocktail hitting all the marks  fresh and abundant  served in the shell  full tail and claws   with a homemade cocktail sauce   The sliders were average  the frites were frozen  my life s biggest angst      while my colleague had English fish and chips  while it was cod  yum   it did not look hand dipped  and again with the frozen  chips      I asked for Guinness  and while the server  who was very attentive and friendly  never said anything  I know she was feeding me semi stout from a local brewery  Why not just say so   If I ask for Diet Coke  servers typically go out of their way to say  We only have diet Pepsi      but I digress   Impressive facility  hell  its Vegas     but didn t have the requisite pubby feel to it  And      for lunch for two    pints each  is a bit rich   Yeah  yeah  maybe I don t need   pints at lunch    save it   Oh  and they have a hot dog on the menu for       wtf ,3,2012-02-10
Food was good for the price  Generous portions  good service but food was not outstanding ,3,2017-11-20
Nice atmosphere  Good service  Food was not good   No one at the table was impressed with their food   Better food in Vegas ,2,2016-02-17
When you walk for a little over two hours in the maze of the Strip casinos like a modern Daedalus AFTER running a half marathon and almost being trampled by an angry crowd   you are HUNGRY  And thirsty  For beer  in my case   We had set our views on Todd English PUB before race  thinking that it was far enough from Mandalay Bay to be spared by runners  And since we had parked our car in the Aria   we just had to eat ourselves silly  roll out of the restaurant and into the car  set autopilot to the hotel and go to bed  Easy enough   But the place was totally hopping when we arrived  and we were told that it would be a    minute wait  Bummer  Fear not  dear friends  We managed to grab seats at the bar  sit down  felt like heaven  and went to business   The place is nice and definitely  urban pub  like  And the menu was quite appetizing  but what wouldn t be after such an ordeal    I ordered just before the last call a glorious shepherd s pie that was probably the best I have had in my life  Big chunks of beef AND lamb in a luscious ragu sauce  fluffy potatoes  generous layer of melted cheese   the ultimate comfort meal  But it was      OK  I get it  You are paying for the name  and the craft  But when you go on the beer menu and see that a pint of PBR is priced      you have to wonder  Who are they kidding here  Fine  we are in Vegas  On the Strip  But PBR is PBR  I couldn t get over it  I ended up choosing the only  reasonable  choice on this insanely extravagant drink menu   a combo PBR tall boy and a shot of Jameson for       Slots machines are definitely not the only money traps out there ,3,2011-12-13
Although rarely a foodie haven  English Pubs have always had a soft spot in my heart  Cheap food that is usually decent  and reasonably priced imported draft beer is usually enough to keep my happy    I had been hearing about the Todd English PUB in Vegas for awhile and wanted to try it out    This is really more of a high end gastro pub than a traditional  old school  English Pub  So the food was solid   The Shepards Pie was a   star home run  One of the best I ve ever had  Huge chucks of moist meat  soft potatoes with a yummy crust  and a gravy sauce that will make your knees weak   seriously  be sure you re sitting down   The Duck Buns were a surprise  Seriously  Duck Buns in a English Pub  I figured they were reaching outside their wheelhouse to try and be a little too diverse  But I was wrong  The plum bbq sauce was a little too salty I think  but the duck was super juicy and the buns were perfect    The beer however    ouch  First of all  they advertise hundreds of beers on tap  So me being German    I was excited  But they were out of the first beer I ordered  So I picked another one  Out of that one too  Hmmm  OK  let s try my third choice  Yep  also out  Yikes  Usually I m a three strikes and you re out kind of guy  but I finally said  Let s make this easier  What DO you have in stock    I finally chose a Black Butte Porter  one of my favorites from my days in Oregon  and a flight of   tastings  They are pretty proud of their beer here  That Black Butte Porter         Wow  you can get the same thing at Yardhouse for     The sampler flight         Holy crap     for each shot glass of beer  Talk about buyers remorse   The service was also hit and miss  For the first    minutes or so our waitress was on it  Then she disappeared for over an hour and we had to flag down other table s waitresses for water and extra napkins   Still  the quality food makes this place a solid   stars  Would I go back  Yes  but I d probably skip the beer next time and just focus on food  Kind of the opposite of why you usually go to a English Pub though ,3,2012-04-13
Really wanted to like this place   Great atmosphere but the food was mediocre   I could have overlooked the food were it not for the less than friendly service   It was a Saturday night but this place wasn t even busy  yet our server acted like we were a huge pain in the ass for even coming in   Would maybe try this place again because of their great happy hour prices and my eternal optimism ,2,2012-06-08
The   of us shared junk chips and a Bloody Mary   We also took advantage of the free beverage offer through Yelp   So many things I would like to try  so little time   Walking by the kitchen  every dish looked delicious   Excellent location right outside of Aria  my favorite place thus far   I will definitely be coming back   Food was worth the price ,4,2015-07-05
A cool atomosphere located right outside the Aria  We got in right away thinking we could get brunch but that s only available on the weekends  Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive  We had wings for an appetizer which were so so  Good sauce but the skin was a little tough    In our group   people got the portobello burger which they loved  Great for a vegetarian   One person had the build your own sandwich which he ended up liking but it seemed weird that you had to put it together yourself    I had the CBLT sandwich which was awesome  Huge piece of chicken with a great mix of arugula bacon and a spicy ranch    The bloody Mary s were hit or miss  one person in our group loved it but I thought it was too thick  I would still recommend trying it out if your near the aria ,3,2015-10-09
I ve been to Todd English s restaurants in both Boston and Las Vegas and this place doesn t measure up at all   The atmosphere was pretty cool but the food was very disappointing   I had the Bison burger and I d much rather have an In N Out burger   The meat was bland and the bun wasn t fresh   My wife had the lobster roll and it was very salty   No need to dress up lobster if the quality is good   I d probably won t be going back   Way too many better options in Vegas for a     per person lunch ,2,2010-07-07
Yumsville     This place is perfect  Great menu  friendly staff    awesome decor atmosphere    We ordered lobster roll  omg  I mean great taste   big portion   then we had the house made foot long hot dog w chill   onions  Best dog I ve eaten  Their house bread is perfect    There is something on the menu for everyone  Great beer selection    We happened to be there when Netherland   Argentena started the semi final soccer game  We got a perfect table facing the screen  It s huge must if your eating in  Vegas ,5,2014-07-10
Terrible Lobster Rolls  Solid Ahi Tuna and free beer if you chug it in under   seconds  Oddly enough  I kind of liked Todd English Pub  but not enough to give it   stars   Good spot for beers if you re trapped at the Aria for   days and don t have much interest in venturing out       visit  Cioppino was actually decent ,3,2012-12-21
I wouldn t recommend if your a true foodie  They are slacking on quality  Ordered the duck buns  tasted old  lobster roll  grossly over buttered as if dropped in a gallon jug of oil and the burger  dry   not flavorful   There are other places on the strip I would prefer for food   If food is not a priority and it s just fuel  this is a fun lively bar  Great decor,2,2015-02-22
Nice beer selection and a really nice staff  They will help you find a good beer that you re looking for  The food is solid bar food  classic in that regard  The portions are huge so beware of that  They also have a beer challenge whereas if you finish a beer before the timer runs out  you get it for free ,4,2014-09-08
Horrible place  Wanted to always try this place and did with a horrible time  The venue looks awesome and the people were ok  But the food is horrible    the service so so  So we got seated at a regular booth for   people but we decided we want to sit on the table with a keg installed so we can pour our own beer with their tap  We ordered  Corn dog puppies  i can buy them at walmart and put them in a oven myself  F  Spicy crispy chicken wings  really how can you serve this   D   Beer battered onion rings  its hard not to go wrong with fried food   C   Sliders   nothing great  C   Brown butter lobster rolls  i would of expected at least average  D    Food was horrible     Next the whole time while we were ordering and eating and waiting our keg broke and they had a guy fix it the whole time we were ordering  eating  trying to drink  so we had a party of   because of the worker    What did Todd English PUB employees and manager decide to do when I complained    Hey Im sorry  how about a   cups of beer   Thanks but F off     Will not come back  A really nice venue but failure in their food and service    Isnt a restaurant a place to eat good food and have a good time with friendly workers  Especially at their prices come on now,1,2012-09-04
The waiter was extremely friendly and attentive  the beer selection was good but not fantastic  the food was quite good   The lobster roll was really good and so was the corned beef sandwich   I d recommend picking on of those specials they have where you choose the type of meat and bread and the you make your own sandwich   The price was on the high side but i believe they run special happy hours regularly so if you don t mind the crowd you can go there during those times ,4,2012-11-15
I don t know why I like this place  because the service is rough and the prices are way too high on everything  But there is something to be said for a    draft beer  At least it tastes good  While never being impressed  I still go back  so there must be something  ,4,2014-04-23
After two recent trips to Las Vegas which included two trips to the PUB I figured it s time I wrote a review   In a town lacking in quality beer  as far as I could tell in my two short trips  I was happy to stop by and get a nice cask ale    My first trip had us enjoying a drink at the bar while we waited a few moments for a table   We sat at the low bar area which is not preferred   It s really awkward to interact with the bar servers but it worked for what we needed   For dinner we had the dirty chips  corndogs and spicy chicken wings   Portions were huge and the food was good   The second visit I was alone and wanted to sit at the bar   Ended up at the low bar   But the beer was tasty and my chicken tacos were wonderful   Service was very friendly and efficient both times I went   Prices are high but that s expected due to location   I ll be back during my next visit I m sure ,4,2012-01-31
Way overpriced for what you get   Check in on Yelp and you get a free bud light  other than that I d avoid this place ,2,2014-09-15
DO NOT COME HERE   I was so excited to try this place out because their happy hour menu looked great  We ordered WELL WITHIN HAPPY HOUR but when we got our bill  everything was regularly priced  The waitress said that someone must have entered it incorrectly in the computer and it was too late to change it  They were incredibly rude and unwilling to fix THEIR OWN mistake  I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE and I recommend people stay far away from this scam  HORRIBLE ,1,2016-06-01
This is a nice place  good atmosphere  but always busy  so definitely make a reservation  The food is excellent  and the menu identifies gluten free options too  Recommended   More on gluten free in Las Vegas   https   www facebook com groups gluten free las vegas ,4,2013-06-01
The Skinny  food is okay with the tendency towards overseasoning        service   was okay  refills were quite prompt        value   overpriced for what it is      Headed here for their gourmet version of pub food  We ordered fish and chips and the chicken pot pie   The fish and chips  around      weren t anything special  The fish  albeit the quality of the fish is very good  suffered from an overly heavy  crispy batter and too much salt  I m not sure why there was battered and fried parsley on the plate either  Like eating fish and chips isn t bad enough as it is   The chips weren t as crisp as they ought to be  The cole slaw had a combination of peas and cabbage   in the end  it had too much mayo  not enough acidity    The accompanying tartar had too much relish added to it  The malt vinegar aioli was unpleasant as well  Sour mayonaise  I d like to stick to malt vinegar  thank you very much   The chicken pot pie fared  around      better but still had some issues  Albeit the puff pastry on top was nice  there wasn t enough chicken and veggies underneath  The sauce was a little too thin and rendered the bottom part of the pastry to be too soggy   Overall  had better chicken pot pie for less   My overall experience was okay and the food wasn t bad    it just wasn t great  Despite the issues  the food alone would have been a      However  given the absurd prices given the quality  I would probably give it a   overall ,3,2010-08-30
Great service  food was quick to arrive and tasted great  The adult milk shakes are good   however a bit pricey ,4,2015-10-13
So disappointing  The service was horrible  Beer tap selection was sad  Had an Old Guardian because it was somewhat interesting  Food  Our server forgot to order it  The  frickles  and fries were so so  Save your money and find a Sin City Brewing Co  Station instead ,3,2013-01-05
We recently were in Las Vegas and had read multiple reviews of Todd English  even though I had never heard of him  and went to his Pub   We enjoyed our meal here and our server was really nice  friendly and helpful   There were obviously tons of beers and I decided on the Delerium Tremen which was really good   For my meal I ordered the brown butter lobster roll and it was super tasty with the rolls toasted just enough to make them crispy   It s definitely pub food here and a little expensive but that s to be expected in Vegas ,3,2012-02-22
Only scoring a two star because the food was edible and the vibe of the place was very cool  After spending a lot of dough on an amazing meal at STK the night before we decided on a more casual less expensive  or so we thought   one  Todd English has gotten a lot of buzz on Top Chef so why not  Well this is why not  the food was ridiculously overpriced  carelessly made and couldn t hold a candle to any nickel and dime pub in Great Britain for a tenth of the cost  My     plate of corned beef was so cold I had to send it back  when it came back the flavor wasn t even up to Costco s high standard and the cioppino tasted like a pile of boiled seafood doused with a canned spaghetti sauce  I nearly spit up a gold tooth when I saw the bill was     before the tip       for one beer flight of four tiny tastes  Really  The only thing I enjoyed about my meal was the French onion soup but beware for    it ll be half the size of the one you are used to  This place is a miss for me  Not coming back unless Todd invites me to dine for free ,2,2014-02-12
Updating my review for this fancier pub fare   Mac and Cheese   This stood out  One of the best restaurant mac and cheese s I ve tried in the recent mac phase   Sliders   well made and tasty   Fancy grilled cheese   had tomatoes and bacon  YES   Pastrami   chunky  delicious  Chicken Parm Slides   also tasty  See a trend  Some of the best I ve had of all of these and I would definitely go back  Well located in the city center,4,2013-07-16
Sheena is the most amazing bartender  She keeps the place running ,4,2014-09-28
I recently was in Vegas for business   We went to the pub for lunch to meet a client and the food and service took quite a while considering we had to cancel our next meeting   With that being said  the place was really busy   The food was great and the atmosphere was casual ,4,2013-02-28
Food is tasty  they have a good beer selection and the atmosphere is cool  BUT I think the food is overpriced  I know it s Vegas  but still   A great tip   if you can chug beer like a pro go for the   second beer challenge  Choose a beer      or less  and if you can finish it in   second or less it s free  You can do this twice daily ,3,2012-09-18
Good traditional atmosphere and great servers   Great beer selection   Food was okay and over priced ,3,2014-06-15
Two years ago  I submitted a one star review  It was totally directed at a manager decision  We received a very nice apology from the restaurant via e mail  and have returned many times since then  Enough times that many of the bar staff recognize us  Unfortunately  on our last visit  we had another bad experience  About halfway through our first beers  we ordered an early dinner  An hour later  after more beer  we still hadn t received any food  We felt we couldn t wait any longer  and closed our tab  We needed food to offset the alcohol  Not sure whose fault this was  Again  the bar staff was  mostly  attentive  We understand there has been a big turnover lately  New ownership  Anyway   don t know if the food is still good  Since we didn t get any   ,1,2017-05-30
Wow   Did not expect the quality I received at a pub   Omg lobster rolls are amazing   Highly recommend    Also had the oysters and they were also great    Very fresh and flavor was spot on    Lobster though  wow   Cooked to perfection  great flavor   Server was awesome   name wad Jocelyn   She was knowledgeable and friendly   She actually recommended the lobster rolls ,5,2015-05-09
Outside   Inside seating on a warm Spring evening  Promptly seated and enjoyed a free bud light for checking in        Our server was wonderful  explained the menu and options and my friends and I were pretty full by the time we reached the half way point    Their meats are sliced  not really a burger  not really a steak   I had the Fish and Chips  which was Humongous  and the fries were nicely  LIGHTLY seasoned     Can t wait to come back,4,2013-04-28
Had lunch on Friday        Great experience  very cool Pub interior  tables with taps   We sat outside in a very pleasant atmosphere   Service was perfect  attentive and informative but not intrusive   Fish and chips may have been the best I have had outside of London   Highly recommend it ,4,2012-11-03
Popcorn and beer to start  please    We had dinner here before heading out to see Peepshow   Great choice  ladies   I love the space and the feel of this place  Ooooooo that rhymed    It had the vibe of a vintage contemporary pub with the sounds of eager sports fans gathering for a bite before the big game   Um  there really wasn t a big game happening it just felt like that  I had The Amsterdam burger which was okay   The pastrami was not piled on and not really that special   The fatty fries were okay  but I did enjoy the sweet potatoe fries instead   i think my favorite was the Chocolate Dipped Strawberry cocktail which was a mix of   different beers   excellent   I don t know much beyond the usual Bud Light s and Taj Mahal s  but this was worth it   Not sure if my burger was worth     though   That s all right   it s all about spending time with good friends and okay food  wait is that even right    I m one to give places another go just because there s so much on the menu that one dish would knock me off my feet   I would hope ,3,2010-11-13
We absolutely love this place and come every time we visit Vegas  The Bloody Mary is PHENOMENAL  it s a great place to watch games  and don t forget the  seven second challenge   you basically chug a beer in seven seconds and it s free   you can do it twice a day and it s the perfect way to start every Vegas morning     As far as food goes you can t go wrong but there are some high points on the menu  For example  the lobster roll will absolutely change your life and the salmon addition to salads is a must have  The main take away is that this place is a must go and YOU ARE WELCOME ,5,2017-01-02
Justin B  and myself came here for lunch on a friday afternoon around  pm  place wasnt too packed and was seated at a booth right away  the lunch menu consists of a lot of burgers sandwiches and a great selection of beer  i decided to go with the make your own sandwich carvery option  you basically get to choose the bread  meat  and sauce to create your own sandwich  i went with the     pound of beef brisket on mini kaiser rolls for about      think mini sliders   the portions are super generous  i was full after making   sliders and i practically still had an entire plate of brisket leftover  pair that with some tasty skinny fries and a hefenweizen   it s a great lunch and way to start of the weekend  haha  note   the brisket leftovers  even cold  made a great late night snack while drunk at  am haha   ,4,2010-05-11
I loveP U B  never miss it whenever I m in Vegas   Coolest atmosphere  great food and drinks  excellent service  My favorite is the Lobster Cobb Salad  I wish they d open in MIami ,4,2015-07-13
Second time in Vegas  second time at Todd English PUB     Overall on both trips I found the food to be good   a modern take   update on simple pub food   this trip had the shrimp as an appetizer   good but I also feel like any place on this level shouldn t screw this up   and the New Amsterdam   that burger was great   good flavor with a lot going on   My only complaint for this place was prices of some items   I get that its in Vegas and on the strip prices can be a little inflated  but    for a PBR and    for a Bud Light seems a little steep especially considering I was able to order a great craft beer for just a few dollars more rather than having a BUD    ,4,2014-01-22
Terrible  Hubby  and I ordered Bloody Marys  We didn t realize they were     a piece  They were okay but not     good  We ordered pickles which were nothing more than Clausen jarred pickles and some Ralphs gerkins for     Bar stools were dirty  We wanted to like this place  but way too expensive for the quality  Nothing special  The only plus was free peanuts at the bar   Wait staff were nice but not up to Vegas standatds  Save your money and go somewhere else ,1,2014-06-17
Disclaimer   I got there late after a long poker session so only had the short menu they start serving at       pm   Have read good things about the normal menu so will update this review if I ever have that   Got the beef sliders and mini corn dogs  Sliders   Bland   The beef wasn t really seasoned  though I guess that s standard in many places  so didn t really taste great   The slider buns were pretty good   nice flavor and texture   It let you eat your slider without things spilling everywhere   But overall it just didn t taste that great   Even the onions they serve it with get lost in the strength of the slider s sauce as well as the pickles served with it    Mini corn dogs with skinny fries   Corn dogs were  again  bland   The batter had a nice texture but don t think it offered much flavor beyond just kind of a normal sweetness   The dogs were made of decent meat  I think  but just not seasoned   Fries were ok   but they did get soggy towards the bottom of the cup   Not so bad since they would get cold served on a plate  there were lots of them    I m willing to try again as it looked like a really cool place and the Aria poker room is my new favorite   But the food  so far  was poor   Service was kind of lacking too   Bartenders spent a lot of time socializing while patrons were kind of waiting there for service   My water glass went unfilled my whole meal ,2,2011-05-15
One of the worst restaurant experiences I ve had  We show up with a party of five  We are told that   cannot be accommodated due to reservations  We ask if a chair can be brought to a table of   which they offer to us  still have a party of    and they can t do it  The whole time the young hostess clearly is frustrated with her day and giving us attitude the while time  We tell her we will walk to the bar and find seats  We find   and are told after sitting sanding there for   minutes that it is a service well and we will not be served if we sit there   At this point we find another   chairs with   other guests leaving shortly     of us sit  stand and hostess now returns to us and offers us one of the  draft tables   But she says if we sit here we cannot be served by the restaurant and would need to place and retrieve our orders from the bar   We continue to sit at the bar and after a few minutes a bartender takes out order    guys order one of which gets an incorrect beer order   I ask for a delirium and I am told they are out   I then ask about the    second challenge   Our bartender says   u don t want that now just order a drink   I decline and say I want the   second and ask what beers are available  she mumbles the beers and walks away     minutes goes by and she returns  I ask which beers again and I hear the list  She says Boddingtons is the best  I refuse telling her I want PBR  She walks away again and returns in   minutes   My party proceeds to order food which she gives us a confused look and says I thought you guys only wanted beer and then gripes about having to split the check   She asks me again what I want to order and I say the seven second challenge  she returns with a Boddingtons and tells me to wait for her return  I examine the beer  see it s not PBR and wait for her return again    minutes goes by and she returns  At this point I m furious with the horrid service and attitude from all their staff  She insists I ordered Boddingtons  At this point I walk out due to total incompetence by the staff there   Very rude  disrespectful and clearly doesn t care what the customer wants  Never go there again ,1,2014-09-07
Next to the Aria casino in Crystals mall   A pretty good example of an English pub with Vegas prices   The bangers and mashed were as I recall them from England  good but not something I would eat everyday   The grilled bologna sandwich brought back memories of youth   Lots of excellent beers on tap  they have Fuller s ESB which is hard to find in the USA ,3,2011-05-11
Great selection of beers   We got the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and split the rotisserie beef sandwich  essentially a French dip    Both were good   Great service   Our server Chris was very knowledgable about the beers   Would recommend   Enjoy ,4,2015-09-19
For an overall experience   I would give this place   stars based on a combination of happy hour and regular items  You definitely need to get the lobster rolls  They don t skimp out on the amount of lobster meat inside the rolls   The coleslaw is fresh and the buttery rolls complement the juicy and flavorful lobster chunks    The beer pairing for the lobster is Blanche de bruxelles and complemented it very well   It reminds me of a more subtle Blue Moon which has no aftertaste at all   For a smaller than pint serving at        you should definitely hit this place up for happy hour where all their beer selections are     off  They have an extensive list of beers to choose from    The footloong dog is huge and comes with chili and onions for an additional       It can easily be shared between two people  I ve had better hotdogs at Nathan s    The sliders are exactly what you get  The lobster rolls are definitely worth making a visit for ,4,2016-06-03
March Madness is truly madness if you re looking for a spot to sit at any Vegas sports book after  AM  So  Friday morning  we got our bets in and headed to find a comfortable place to get something to eat and watch some games  Walking around  we ended up at Todd English P U B   which had everything we wanted  seats at the bar  breakfast options  and TVs showing the games  This was one spot  I was glad we stopped in  I had one of the best bloody mary s  ever  spicy  with the right mix of vodka  Hangar One  and tomato juice and the perfect garnish of pickled carrot and a block of cheddar cheese with some pickled string beans  all with a salt and peppered rim  Delightful  One of those babies and that s all I needed for the afternoon   Breakfast was good but a little salty for my taste  There were a few brunch options  I got the bacon  egg  cheese sandwich  bacon on the side  and Gramercy Guy had the English breakfast  fried eggs  bacon  toast and beans  These beans were the show stealer  I traded my bacon for the beans and thinking about them now is making my mouth water  There was meat  I was told from the bar tender  it s what s ever left on the cutting board  with the right balance of smoky  probably from the meat  and sweet  Had I known how good the beans were  I would have swapped the fries I barely touched for more beans  And you know what they say about beans being for the heart  So really this was a perfectly balanced meal between the beans and the tomato juice   The cool thing about Todd English P U B  is their drink challenge  Along the bar  there are many hour glasses that flip  they are timed for   seconds  The challenge  if you can drink a pint of beer before the time runs out  it s free  I knew I wasn t up for the challenge but watched many people around me do it  some more than once  Matt  the bartender  guessed that about     of the people who try actually succeed   To see pictures and read more go to http   gramercygirl blogspot com         todd english pub html,4,2012-03-25
My friend and I were walking around Vegas and stumbled on this pub  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive  He refilled our water about   times  He recommended the Prime Dip sandwich  I really enjoyed it  The prices are reasonable for being in the strip  The French fries were fresh and crispy  My friend ordered the Bangers and Mash and he didn t mind it but I thought it was awful  The mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box  I hated the gravy and it was all over it ,4,2017-05-23
Nice atmosphere  but nothing too special  Good beer selection and cool build your own Bloody Mary ,3,2015-04-12
I have had my substantial    well actually too many for one s own good  of Vegas affairs and visits in my lifetime  So I have seen  wined  dined  swam  raved  raged  raved  and raged etc    pretty much most places worth going to   I have always thoroughly enjoyed Todd English P U B  conveniently located by the lobby of Aria   This spot has been  the new up and coming place  and has flourished ever since   Great place to come and grab some nice bar bites and as always a great selection of alcohol   They have a very unique and special brew menu to choose from with beers coming from all corners of the world   AAAAND wooow    their Bloody Marry s     over the top crazy   Very nice and original house mix    but their fixin s     is literally like a bouquet of goodies overflowing from the top of your glass   There is literally like a full meal of food dressing your glass  from chicken wings  to cold cuts  to shirmp  and even a crab leg  all blossoming out of your bloody marry   Of course you can make it to your customized liking   I think it was a bit too busy for me  so I will stick to the basics next time    but it was OH SO GOOD   P  I always always ALLLWAYS bring the crew here for the seven second beer chug challenge   It s a really fun way to get the party started during the day while hanging out and munching on some good eats   You basically choose a premium    beer  and you have to chug a pint of it in   seconds and its  FREE     P  You can do it twice   Awesome way to get a free buzz going   Of course please do tip your bar tender well   The   second chug is quite doo able  but if you need something easier to complete this challenge  try the Irish Creme beer they have  it is less carbonated and goes down way smoother   Usually they don t let you  but if you rub the bar tender the right way  and you feel like a champ  try to do the  sec chug with a nice dark stout and you will be good for a while   Tried it a couple times and    yea    it unleashed the beast   P  Finally   on to the food    Yummmzzz   Very tasty and creative   We always get the Junk Chips to munch on and soak up the alchy   It is pretty tasty with fresh cut and fried housemade chips loaded with bbq pulled beef  loaded with a house aioli and all the nacho type fixin s   It is like a classy    nacho    on roids   Their main dishes and entrees are very good as well   They have a super wide array of eats from fresh salads  to lobster rolls  to fancy burgers  to a raw seafood bar  and grade A protein  there will be something to fancy your appetite   Great upscale bar like atmosphere accompanied with friendly and welcoming service   Not the cheapest place on the block to grab a bite and drinks  but heck  you re in Vegas    you didn t come here to save money   P  I will always pay a visit when I am in town ,5,2013-11-22
Great menu and atmosphere   Awesome beer selection   Steve is an awesome waiter,5,2013-01-20
Beer took    minutes to get to our table  Fly in my water  Half of food came late  Service not worth the price but food is good ,1,2013-10-18
Todd English pub is bang on with over     craft beers from around the globe  You don t need a passport to taste some of the world s best beers just a barstool and order away  The food is great with a wide array of items including oysters on the half shell and killer sliders ,5,2015-09-23
Fabulous Bloody Mary  The big ones are only on the weekend but Andrew our server made it happen today and we were so grateful  He provided excellent service and made what could have been a big disappointment a very enjoyable experience  Great food and drinks ,5,2016-04-01
Oh man this place is crazy good  We came for the famous  All About Mary  bloody mary  but we were hungry too of course  We came right as they opened on Sunday at       I got confused a few times  they ONLY serve that bloody mary from      am    pm Saturday and Sunday ONLY    I came too late once and on the wrong day another time   It was the best bloody mary I ve ever had  which is saying something because I just reviewed another place a few weeks ago saying the same thing  However  I haven t tried too many bloody marys in my time  However I think this one wins out if only simply because of the min bacon burger and hot wing on top  Haha   I also got the lobster rolls which came with some pretty thick but tasty chips  The lobster rolls were heavenly  I couldn t finish the toppings on the bloody mary as well as my main dish  but I gobbled it down later for lunch  So good  Even as leftovers   One down side is the waitress never gave us napkins or refilled our waters  Mehh    I m sure another time it iwll be better  I want to try more from them ,5,2016-06-07
Decided to try this place out after a couple times of walking past it to go to Aria s Casino  It was a Saturday so I some what expected slow service  but it was really slow  Our waiter seemed to forget about us after ordering our fried pickle appetizer when we had told him we just needed a minute to look at the drink menu  The fried pickles we ordered were just average  and we also ordered kobe beef sliders that were okay  Our waiter asked what type of cheese we wanted on the burgers to then see on the bill a    charge for the cheese  It was not very good customer service to act like it was included and not tell us about the up charge  Prices were above average and the food did not deliver  Probably won t give this place a second try,3,2019-08-05
    pints  they must be taking the piss   Sure it s on the strip and next to the mall  but there are other beer bars in close proximity that are not this avaricious   Yes  the food is solid  but no food is solid enough to justify such hefty beer prices   Fleece the punters whilst you can  because once the economy goes through another downturn this place will disappear ,1,2016-07-23
Oh yeah    Worth the wait    Abso crunchy lisciously roll your eyeballs backwards three Xs scrumptious   That almost describes TE s mini corn dogs  I love them  Maui French fry style   mix the ketchup with the mustard   Boyfriend tosses em back with full strength Dijon  Since I missed out on my Michael Mina lobster corn dog this trip  I was aching for these mini morsels   Todd English PUB is a great mix of fun  food and nice service  It s a great rest stop from fancy dining  The pub smokes their meats and Boyfriend enjoys the French dip sammie  This time around my daughter in law and I shared their grilled bologna sandwich  Yes AFTER the corn dogs  Yum    TE also mixes in fun  Sit at the bar and under lit   second egg timers challenge you to their beer chug contest  Down a pint before the last grain of sand hits bottom and you win a second pint free  They also have a beer pong ball machine   think gum ball machine filled with logo ed pingpong balls   for more fun and games  They might not encourage responsible drinking but hey  This is Vegas baby   This is a solid four star for food and fun ,4,2011-10-14
The food leaves much to be desired  Granted I m not a huge fan of pub food but I expect at least average fare from a restaurant with Todd English s name attached    For example the recommend roast beef sliders       are barley edible  even after consuming multiple libations when just about anything should taste good    Food aside  I d give the atmosphere   stars for it s warm and friendly vibe  I d recommend it as a nice venue for casual drinks with friends   If you re looking for a quick bite to eat head over to the Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria in the Crystal mall ,3,2010-12-16
A hip place  maybe too hip  that was way overpriced   The bartenders were cute  helpful and nice   The beer selection was pretty good   But  the beers were just not that fresh and were VERY expensive   No one wanted to pay for the expensive pub grub      for fish   chips   so we had a few beers and headed to Burger Bar at the Mandalay Bay   It was much better  see my review if you like  ,3,2011-07-08
        With my GF  Lunch     Fright United Kingdoms     Came with   drinks  all biter beers  I didn t like it that much  but I was able to finish them all      type of beer I like  Blue moon      Fish   Chips     My GF like the dish she was able to finish it in no time  Came with two sauces              Sirloin     Didn t like it that much  Didn t finish it either  It came disassemble so you have to assemble it yourself  However  I was told by our waitress that I have to assemble them myself           Total          Pro  It s a sport bar  my sanctuary  We were watching FIFA USA vs  England   Con  None,4,2010-06-17
Try the    raw oysters  Blue points and wild Cowboys  Be careful of the insanely hot horseradish  It will light you up and make you cry for your momma ,4,2016-09-03
Todd English PUB is one of the spots that I wanted to try out when I came to Vegas because they have this pretty large drink that literally is lunch on top of your Bloody Mary    Didn t have to make reservations  just sat down at the bar and ordered the drink  It literally has some chicken wings  hamburger slider  shrimp  veggies and some cheese all sticking out of the drink    Overall it s for sure picture worthy and the blood mary itself tasted pretty good  They use to serve this only on the weekends but since it became so popular it can now be ordered anytime    It s for sure worth a try if you enjoy the taste of meat and bloody Mary s  Literally that was my lunch and I had nothing else until late that evening    Also the service at the bar is pretty quick and really nice ,3,2017-07-08
I have been here several times with friends and family  This is one great place for beer  food and a fun time   They have a wide selection of beers and they even have the table where you can pour your own beer  How fun is that  I tried several of their dark beers last time I was there and I certainly will return for their Gluten free beer  what an intrresting concept    For food  I enjoy fried pickles lots  The tsweetness and sourness match perfectly with the cripsy outside  Another appetizer is the duck buns  The bun seems a bit too much but the duck is juicy and delicious  Main course I like the beef brisket and prime ribs in their bbq section    Lamb chop is a great choice too but unfortunately they do not have mint jelly  My all time favourite is the shepherd s pie which is a must order  ,5,2013-01-28
Fried pickles were amazing  bangers and mashed were recommended to me by a visiting British cop and I loved then   You have to do the   second  it s easy if you don t pick a heavy beer   English beer flight was well worth it as well   Overall I will be back for sure ,4,2014-01-17
Todd English is as good as it always is   Really enjoyed meeting    and talking up beer with    bartender Chad   He set me up with one of his new favorites  Sculpin Grapefruit IPA  and as a result  it s now one of my favorites  too  Will return  for sure ,5,2016-01-04
Was there this weekend and tried the fried pickle chips and wings and pretzels   I m addicted to pickle chips so anywhere that has them I will probably love   The staff and management here were also super nice   I can t wait to go back   There is also cute outdoor seating and I didn t notice any smoke so I m guessing it is a smoke free place ,5,2014-02-05
    stars  but rounding up because Todd English is a welcome change of pace from the rest of the restaurants and nonsense around the strip    Had a great time there  superb beer menu unlike many slightly more snobby pubs on the Strip  Beers from around the world and a healthy variety of small craft brews  I had a couple different ones while I was there and will definitely try more when I go back  Had the duck buns for my appetizer and they were delicious  I realize this kinda contradicts the overall tone of this review that it was nice to have some pub food as duck buns aren t really what you d expect from a pub  but somehow they fit well  The meat was delicious  well cooked and the buns were great as well    Had the tacos for my entree and they were superb  Just delicious  nothing like some tacos and beer for a dinner  The tacos had this tasty and creamy but not overly heavy sauce on them which was maybe the best part  All too many places also overload with cabbage and such but that wasn t the case at all at Todd English    Again  I think the thing I like most about Todd English is that it was almost like an escape from the Strip  just the overall atmosphere was a pleasant departure  And the food and beer were great  Would definitely go back ,5,2014-02-06
Eating here is a must when staying at Aria  The Chips are beyond words to describe the salivation that takes place in my mouth  The mac n cheese is gooey to perfection  Love this place for a quick       calorie boost,4,2015-03-19
You can get good food and drinks anywhere in Vegas but few places have an atmosphere like Todd English next to the Aria  Be sure to take the   second challenge    Also  the bartenders are great  The music used to be great too but some hipster complained on Yelp and they ruined it for everyone  This review would get five stars if they went back to the old playlist ,3,2015-05-13
Hmmm  where do I start    Food  expensive for what it is  We had the tuna burger  which was good  but not     good  We also had the lobster roll  low quality lobster drenched in creamy sauce  you can barely taste the lobster and the bread was dripping with grease  We also has the French toast which was made from the same bread as the lobster roll and was drenched in syrup    Beers drinks  good selection of beers  I had the Belgium suggested with the lobster roll  it was good  Expensive  but can t complain here    Cocktails  we only tried one  the strawberry mojito  basically sugar water with pieces of strawberries  you can t taste the mint or fruit or most importantly any hint of alcohol  FAIL   Conclusion  come here for decent beers and a cool bar  for food and cocktails  go elsewhere ,2,2014-04-20
Was real disappointed   Was looking forward to sliced pastrami and duck  Pastrami  we ordered a pound  was sliced real thick  between     to     an inch or more per slice  Duck wasn t sliced at all  We ordered one pound and were given a platter with two halves of tasteless duck   The hoisin sauce which we asked for never showed up  We also ordered pickeled vegetables  the waiter didn t volunteer that the vegetables are also served with the meat platters   Good service can save indifferent food  but both the food and service were indifferent    If you want to try Todd English food  I would stick with Olives at Bellagio ,2,2010-05-16
Service   but food    The nachos were very good  The lobster roll which was a Todd English specialty was absolutely terrible  It was heavy fatty and just plain awful   the place is  very loud but the food is less than desirable  I wouldn t go here unless I had to in the future,2,2016-03-18
Thank you Todd English PUB for making my birthday a great one  I needed a place to have my  large party have a bite to eat before dancing the night away  I wanted to find a place close enough to our hotel  Aria  so that my large party wouldn t have to travel so far   I also didn t want to force my party into dining at a fixed menu joint and or spending an arm and a leg for a crappy meal  So I found the PUB  and wasn t disappointed    My boyfriend and I ordered the lobster rolls  mini corn dogs  I know  but I couldn t help it   and the duck buns  All   were soo good  I had people stealing my mini corn dogs while I wasn t looking  I had bites of my friend s shepard s pie   and it was SOOOO good    Service was incredibly great  And making reservations were even more pleasant  The manager was so great in trying to help me out as much as possible  I have to say  eating is not easy for a large group in Vegas  but somehow it worked out here   Thanks so much again      ,5,2010-06-04
I can t believe that I haven t written a review about this place  It s one of my favourites in Vegas  If you re in town for a conference at Aria Bellagio  or anywhere in the area   it s a great spot  Tasty food  lots of good drinks  and really  something for everyone  I like it for a quick lunch in between sessions  or a casual client dinner and drinks at the end of the day  This restaurant was the start of my Todd English love   all of these restaurants are amazing  Right in between Aria and Crystals  it s easy to get to and always a good choice ,4,2015-12-02
Food was delicious and service was quick  Everyone at our table enjoyed their food  from tacos to pot pie to fish and chips  not a single dish disappointed ,5,2015-08-24
My fiance and I ate lunch here on our recent trip to Vegas  Service was excellent  as it should be in Las Vegas  and food was just as good  I just had a Caesar salad  and he had the Shepard s pie  The salad had a very interesting presentation  including full leaves of romaine  The dressing was to die for  and the croutons were possibly the best I ever had  and I consider myself a hard to please Caesar salad connoisseur   It was just enough portion wise  My man loved his Shepard s pie  I had a few bites of it as well  and it was very tasty  Food here was well presented  and came out quickly  I wish we had been there at dinner time when more is maybe going on  I love that the tables here double as beer pong tables  Too bad there would have been no other patrons to challenge  Damn  Prices were your Vegas norm   entrees were approximately         depending on what you order  Excellent place over all   We will be back ,5,2010-04-13
I really can t say enough good things about this place   It s not that expensive   this is Vegas after all   and the food is excellent  service prompt and efficient and ambience comfortable   Highly recommend the onion rings  And the homemade donuts for dessert   Convenient location in the middle of the Vegas strip   Will definitely return,5,2011-11-23
By far one of the best places to grab a drink in town  We had the lovely bartender Kelly C    she was fantastic   My husband loves old fashions and Kelly made him one of the best old fashions he said he s ever had   We also appreciate how attentive she was to our waters and was lovely to chat with  Great sense of humor  If you re ever near Aria  definitely check out Todd English   sit at the bar near Kelly C ,5,2017-08-12
food was less than mediocre  service was good and we were comped on the brie sandwich that two in our party had that was no good    but only one person in a party of six said anything good about their meal    seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food  but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere ,1,2010-09-13
This is your usual English Pub   They have British beer and pub cuisine   The prices are Vegas prices but nothing exceptionally outrageous   I had my go to English cuisine  Banger s and Mash   The people I ate with both had fish   chips  so I was able to try my two favorite pub dishes   Both were very solid and there are no complaints from my end in terms of food   Their beer list is very solid and not just British centric  but their prices are very high  even for Vegas standards   If you are looking for your typical British Pub on the strip  then look no further   I don t think you will find a better adaptation on the strip   Crown and Anchor would be my recommendation if you want this fare off the strip  but nothing wrong with Todd English ,3,2016-01-02
Four of us went at  pm on a Wednesday evening for Happy Hour dinner  For HH there is a huge selection of draught beer and wines by the glass that are half off   There is also a     bottle of wine special where you can choose from Cabernet or Chardonnay  My brother had the  steak tacos and said they were the best tacos he s had   I had the vegetarian option  the portabello mushroom sandwich   It came topped with roasted red peppers  spinach  cheese  and aioli   By far the best I ve had  and being a vegetarian  I ve had quite a few of these over the years  It also came with a side of pickled vegetables  delicious  The parents had burgers   Dad had the huge buffalo style burger  which came with enough fatty fries for at least   people   Mom had   HH sliders at    each and was full  We were impressed with the price       w tip  for a bottle of wine    beers    hearty  fresh  quality entrees  and   sliders  Our server  Kimberly was super helpful and friendly to boot   We ll definitely be returning ,5,2014-01-16
Decent pub food with a pretty solid staff   I was in Vegas for   days and stayed at the Aria   I found myself at the Todd English Pub quite a few times during my stay and can t say I regret any of them   Be prepared to pay typical Vegas prices  but you should receive good service ,4,2014-10-18
Fun and cool pub right inside the Aria   The Pub burger and lobster sandwich was great   Beer selection is strong  although I expected a bit more     Overall  fun place to eat at and enjoy a cold beer ,4,2014-03-12
Not a bad place for a pint of Guiness      Service   For a humongous place  the service was quite good   Drinks   Different sizes for a pint of Guiness or your other favorites  And  the pint is the smallest size  Very cool   Food   Oh  I just had dinner and still munched on their food  Order the  Dirty Chip    You gotta try it   Price   Ahhh   okay that was a bit pricey   Ambiance   Too large  not too intimate   Pubs should be eclectic and not  well clubby   But definitely this place is huge   Parking   if you are a local  well  what a pain to wait for your car  but it is part of the valet experience   I would give this place a four  but due to such a large size place and high prices  I gotta reduce it a bit   Nevertheless   GO FOR IT ,3,2011-04-06
Delicious food and drinks  but WAY overpriced  I think a Sculpin IPA was      Ahhh Vegas    ,3,2014-11-22
We had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally got a chance to go  It was yummy  yummy  Our order  Duck buns  sweet potato fries  mac n  cheese  and the deconstructed lamb sandwich  All excellent  My fav  Probably the duck buns  The duck was so tender and succulent  The duck buns were accompanied with a nice cucumber slaw too  Oh  And the sandwich comes with your choice of two spreads  We went for the black truffle mayo and the creamy horseradish  Dip your fries in the black truffle mayo   We re not big drinkers but they had a huge selection of beers  I always just stick to what I love    Guinness  Other than that  the service was great from start to finish  We were seated immediately and never waited long for anything  Our server always knew what we wanted before we asked   We re definitely going back for more duck buns                                                   Revisited P U B  a couple more times and something happened  The food didn t taste quite as delicious as the first time  They changed the duck buns and it was just ok  Ordered a deconstructed sandwich again and the bread was untoasted and the meat was warm  not hot  The staff seemed disorganized  overwhelmed  and unfriendly  What started out as a cool pub with gourmet style food has sadly turned into another sports bar with mediocre food ,3,2010-06-12
I don t understand what people expect from a gastropub    you cannot compare this to a steakhouse or fine dinning experience    As far as gastropubs go    P U B  is amazing    I ordered the dirty chips   whatever they are called that are similar to nachos  and they were excellent    For main course I had the carvery  lamb sandwich with pita bread and truffle mayo  This is probably one of the best sandwiches I have ever had   Truffle mayo was amazing  lamb was perfectly cooked and large portion  and the pita bread was soft and warm    I will be going back everytime I go to Vegas  maybe more than once ,5,2010-09-04
Expensive Pub food  but the quality and service are outstanding   We arrived for Happy Hour and had oysters  nachos  and shrimp   It was a great experience   The atmosphere is sports bar like and the beer selection provided plenty of options   I will definitely check out Todd English P U B  next time I m in Las Vegas ,4,2013-02-01
Beer selection is awesome   Food was very good  We had a group of     and everyone loved their meal  We stopped by another night for drinks  Bartenders very friendly and attentive ,4,2015-06-20
like other restaurants on the LV strip   you re gonna pay a bit of premium   nevertheless   they pour a proper black and tan   and their fish and chips are pretty damn good   it s pricy   but the food is solid   they also have plenty of beers which is always a plus,4,2012-03-20
Good craft beer selections  not great  The lobster rolls are a must try  Attentive wait staff and a hip ambiance  Overall a good way to spend a night out in Vegas ,4,2015-03-07
My husband and I went to PUB for lunch in Vegas during our last visit  I d been dying to try this place since it opened and it did not disappoint   We love Strongbow  sucker for this sweet English summer nectar  and its unusual to find it on draft in the US but PUB had it  We started with Duck Rolls which were gorgeous  light fluffy and so tasty  I could have eaten     My hubby had the lobster rolls which were delightful and I had fish and chips which were the best fish and chips I ve ever tasted  and I m English     Our server tempted us into a bread pudding desert which was just heavenly  Speaking of our server   Alex  he was awesome  attentive and looked after us the entire time  No complaints here on the service   Lunch was typical Vegas prices but for the experience  it was well worth it ,5,2011-09-05
The wife and I decided to give this place a go   I went withe the Grichebactom   which is basically a grilled cheese with bacon and tomato   tried to get cleaver with the name   The wife ordered the Lamb Pita   So as we were waiting they bring out popcorn to munch on   yum     Food is ok   My Grichebactom was cut in half and was only toasted on one side   Not sure if this was intentional but for a grilled cheese it s pretty unacceptable   It does come with a big bucket of fries   The wife lamb pita was ok but it was bombarded with onions   Onions in the salad and also onions in the sauce   We picked this place to use our dining credit at but it turns out that you can t   So just a heads up if you are thinking the same thing   All in all an ok place  although we will probably not pick this place to go back too ,3,2016-04-08
Ordered the lobster roll from here  It was served on a buttery roll  Order came with   small sliders  chips  and coleslaw  The lobster was succulent and flavorful  The coleslaw wasn t as good  Will definitely be coming back for this popular menu item ,4,2014-06-30
We liked it  Not very crowded for a Friday afternoon happy hour  Excellent service and the Apple cider was quite tasty  We did enjoy their wings they had a nice little kick to them and were huge  The lobster rolls were good but I thought a little over rated  I ll probably give them a chance next visit for their Sunday brunch or maybe a dinner ,4,2014-11-20
We just arrived in Vegas and we wanted a quick bite and some drinks to start off our epic adventure   This place was EHH    We shared pitchers of the white sangria  It tasted watered down  I can barely taste the wine or the fruit juice   I ordered the burger sliders which was ok  It was good but wasn t special    We chose this place only because it was the liveliest place to have some drinks and bites within the Aria vicinity ,2,2012-05-02
Great beer selection and enthusiastic servers help make this a fun place to have a beer and some decent pub food   The beers are expensive though  but what do you expect on the Strip ,3,2016-05-16
Came in the entrance the greeter said can you to ten minutes for the waitress to catch up then we can seat u so we got seated and then the waitress  came out five minutes later took the order for drinks wasn t pleasant was completely overwhelmed by having so many tables  In my opinion the manager should staff better this waiter had to come and first apologize for her and then he explained the menu  Very bad first impression overall experience poor not how u should run a business if you can pay for someone to pour soap in ur hands in the bathroom then hire more staff to serve,1,2016-08-28
Great vibe great staff oh and good music  The bartenders are friendly and service is fast i came here for a mini vacation and enjoyed it and even Visited this great place quite a few times for there oysters and clams  One of the bartenders  Jamie  was great she told me where the best spots in Vegas are And even helped me get access into one of the pool hotspots This is a great place if your in Vegas and ps  If you eat the peanuts you throw the shells on the floor   that place is known for that just look at the floor    ,5,2014-11-01
This is why I am always unabashedly checking out menus located outside of restaurants    sometimes  you hit gastronomic gold  We had read the full menu earlier in the day while doing the touristy thing and decided to come back  After a run in with some Patron at Pink Taco s happy hour  seemed like a good idea at the time   we didn t end up getting to our destination till after          where we were saddened to find that they only offer a limited menu from then until  am  Damn you  tequila    I got their very refreshing mojito and the boy and I shared the chicken parm sliders  the sweet potato fries and a Caesar salad  The salad was a Caesar    come on  how can you mess up a Caesar  I appreciated the addition of tomatoes though     the fries were also yummy  not at all greasy or burnt  could have been a bit hotter     the stars were the chicken parm sliders  Tiny cheesy morsels of goodness sandwiched between little fluffy buns that you can add a lettuce tomato mix to    deeeeeelish  Service was good    not overly friendly  but adequate  The thing that I will remember most is the ambiance    very man friendly  but more of a modern Mad Men off duty type of way  I also realized that this is the same place that I had heard of that gives you your beer for free IF you are able to drink it in under seven seconds  The barkeeps rings a very loud bell if you are able to    I heard that bell quite often  lemme tell ya  I definitely want to come back before they close down most of the kitchen    ideally wearing a dress that I stole from Christina Hendrick s wardrobe ,4,2011-05-20
Agree with most of the comments on here  Especially appreciated the happy hour pricing on the sliders and oysters  The food is OK   not mindblowingly special  but not at all bad either   and goes along well with the many beers they have to choose from  And it s quite a comprehensive list  covering many familiar American names  a good cross section of official Trappist breweries  and plenty more Belgian selections too  If I remember correctly  there are more beers listed on the chalkboards above the bar than there actually are on the menu itself    Lots of sports screens and a decidedly wooden motif to the whole joint  A clean  dependable  uncrowded  rustic feeling place for a casual drink during happy hour  Or two  Or three ,3,2013-05-14
Finally  a gastro pub in Vegas   The food is great   On my first visit  decided to go British and try traditional pub food   That meant trying the bangers and mash and the shepherd s pie   Both very good but what was I thinking   I was so envious of the people around me who were enjoying the mountains of meat from the carvery     The very next day I was back again to try the carvery   It was good   After having tried several items  the best is the sirloin with the confit duck legs a close second   There are endless combinations you can create with their different breads and sauces that you can add   Prices are what you expect from the Strip but who cares   Sometimes you just want to enjoy the fa ade that makes Vegas  Vegas   Worth a try ,4,2010-10-12
Best food ever   Everyplace in Vegas tends to have above average food however most places will cost you an arm and a leg   Todd English Pub is reasonable priced and has amazing American Irish food   Try the Lobster Rolls you will not be disapointed   Also they have a great draft beer selection from around the glob ,5,2011-04-29
Located next to crystals shops  Place looks pretty cool  A classic pub style   I ended up ordering the corned beef  I thought it tasted good  although it was a little greasy  The portion size was a little small for the hefty price that they were charging  It s Vegas though  what can you do    I probably would not go out of my way to come back here again  It is a good spot to bring your family    They do have good chocolate popcorn though ,3,2015-07-07
The service here was really slow  They host was hilarious and very friendly but everything took a really long time  For Vegas the one good thing was they had a    beer special so that was nice to see  I got the soft pretzels and my friend got the corn dog puppies  It is a really pricey lunch menu so we were a little disappointed in that for pub food ,2,2012-11-27
This place was my neighbor when i lived at Veer Towers  I really tried to like this place but after   or   visits i did not once leave there impressed  It is just another overpriced vegas strip restaurant lacking in impressive food  The wait staff is severely lacking in attentiveness  the food is not bad but i was expecting much better for a high dollar restaurant  It is a nice location and they keep the place very clean which is important to me but i would much rather spend my money somewhere else ,2,2014-05-02
Oh my goodness   What can I say   Not enough about the Brown butter lobster rolls   Three sweet rolls stuff silly with fresh lobster   It was friggin amazing   Comes with a very onion based coleslaw that I ended up giving to hubby   And a small package of homemade chips  a little oily for me    It s all about the lobster rolls   GET THE LOBSTER ROLLS     Oh  and hubby had the Chicken parm sliders with fries   Good stuff  but totally overshadowed by my yummy lobster rolls   Comment about the hostess at the front  Couldn t be a more unfriendly girl woman   Totally didn t greet us   had her hands crossed in front of her chest the whole time   Never smiled   Bitter   Other than her  everything was great   Nice restaurant   Greeted by our enthusiastic server with a metal  mini bucket  of fresh popcorn   Can t go wrong with popcorn   Get the lobster rolls     ,5,2012-03-09
As far as restaurants and bars go in and around the Aria complex  this pub wins hands down  and is actually more affordable than the other restaurants in Aria   Great beer selection and really good food   If you like sports  there are plenty of TVs   The atmosphere is nice and social  and the decor is perfect   I have eaten here a couple of times now   The menu is better than most pubs  and the food is ever better   I have tried several different dishes and appetizers and they have all been outstanding   My favorite dish is the ribeye  which sits in a pile of mashed potatoes drizzled with sauce  gravy   If you like fish n chips  you won t be disappointed   If you are sitting near the kitchen  watch them expedite things  very well run with great staff all working in sync   This will definitely be a regular stop for me when visiting Vegas ,5,2015-01-06
Highs  quality food  good service  some decent happy hour prices  Lows  tiny portions at high prices,3,2014-03-26
It was great food and perfect atmosphere for our group   Service was top notch  though once we were done eating they did kind of stop filling our waters and such because we sat and talked for a bit ,5,2016-01-25
Yeah baby   this is the place to get a really great craft beer if you are a multi millionaire or absolutely friggin  stupid We just got off the plane and I decided to get myself a decent beer and this joint had a great selection Ryan behind the bar was real friendly and knew his craft beers They ve got    craft beers on tap here and a lot more in bottles and cans I went with a Delirium Tremens Belgian Ale and only       Daaah  with my tip at     pm on Sunday July  nd which was during their HAPPY HOUR from  pm to  pm every day as the sign says I would hate to bloody drink here when it is NON HAPPY HOUR Thank God we later found the Five   Pizza Bar nearby   much better and cheaper food and REAL PRICES for premium craft beers ,3,2017-07-21
    STARS for their very generous and expansive happy hour and their friendly and helpful bartenders staff   I came here on a weekday and even though there were a share of tourists and locals  this place was very full at the bar area   Most of the staff were very chatty   there was a little bit of a back and forth between two staff workers on who really was the more devoted Kobe Bryant and Lakers fan   I got three oysters plus a pint of Lagunitas from my beloved city of San Francisco and later on some sweet potato fries   With happy hour pricing  all of that fell under       I did try their Deschutes Inversion IPA but since it was a cask beer  they served it room temp which sort of turned me off   I realized I need my beer cold   The oysters were fresh and a steal at    each     Now to the beer selection  although they do offer a lot of selections and I saw the taps all around the bar to show it  I wasn t as impressed as I thought   My usual excitement when I go to a place with lots of draught beers  is to find something that I haven t tried and usually it s an unique brew that is hard to find or something like that   Out of all of the beers that were offered  I think I ve tried at least half of them and most of the other half I didn t really want to try   I was hoping maybe to see some smaller breweries from Southern California or Portland but I saw a lot of familiar names  Sam Adams  Trumer Pils  Shock Top  and Sierra Nevada   It s still a good place to go for a drink and to watch the game but maybe I m a beer snob   And the regular menu I didn t try like sandwiches and entrees but with the slightly higher price point due to the location on the Strip and all  I probably will be sticking with happy hour at the bar ,3,2012-05-18
Came here with a few college friends  so naturally we did the pint challenge   That is a solid deal if you put on your frat boy hat and man up   We ordered some bar food which was ok   The one waitress  who looked like Snooki  must hate her job   She was very unpleasant  which meant no tip for her   I d suggest stroll in and pound a few free pints  then head elsewhere ,2,2012-06-23
Great spot  Happy hour was bomb and the bartender was super nice she never on e forgot about us   Great service  ,5,2012-05-15
Best las vegas   hangover   brunch lunch place  Everything looked and tasted like heaven  The super deep fried dirty chips  lobster rolls  fries  sandwiches  burgers  and pastrami sliders cured every ounce of pain I was feeling ,5,2011-09-10
This place recycled every trendy cliche going   The food was heavy and greasy and tasteless   Awful   Really   And Expensive     Fake dartboards painted on the wall      draft beers       potato chips       for   mini corn dogs on top of a pile of limp fries   Rock and Roll XM satellite station  Tabletops had beer pong boards carved in   Pot Pie was     bucks and all pastry   Service was so bad I was angry and felt violated     I love how they brag about not carrying Budweiser products   As if this place isn t just as commercialized and insipid   I felt embarrassed and foolish after paying the tab   Didn t touch my entree but server and busser didn t notice or care   Wow  Todd English  you re so trendy and indie now   The existence of this place signifies the official gastropub  shark jump   Really not a good place at all   ,1,2010-03-30
Best pub in Las Vegas  funny  good atmosphere  amazing food  fresh seafood and cold draft beers ,4,2017-07-25
I love this place   Ask for Melissa  What a sweet heart   From the bologna sandwich to the yummy brunch food  I have never had a bad meal or drink at this place ,5,2014-09-01
As one of the ONLY semi reasonable places to eat and drink in City Center  that alone should put it on your must do list if you re staying there  Overall an awesome place to get your drink on with only a few nitpicky complaints from me    Service Atmosphere  Awesome  We sat at the bar and were well taken care of all afternoon  My gripe here is there aren t enough TVs and they are too small  Unless you get a great seat expect to be squinting at the TV  The placement is also odd  The bar has TV s on the ends but none in the middle  Annoying if you re stuck in the middle seats  This was a fun place to watch World Cup   but only because we got good seats    Drinks  Prices were bad  as expected  Not like gouge you bad  but typical Vegas strip prices         average for a pint  at least they had fancy ass beers        for a glass of wine      for a mixed drink  The free beer if you can chug it in   seconds game was a cool addition but didn t see anyone trying it     Food  Some real gems  A raw bar and carvery and tons of fun sounding British pub type food   SWEET  We tried   meats from the  carvery   Brisket and Duck      of each was    ish meat  Hardly cheap  but I d say count on       pp        each for a good meal isn t terrible  You get to pick   sauces per meat and   bread per meat  The standout sauce is the black truffle mayo   OMG it s wonderful on ANYTHING  You ve made a mistake if you don t choose it   So the brisket was just OK  definitely not best BBQ in vegas material or anything  The duck was FANTASTIC  Only pet peeve here was they just shoved     a duck on our plate  So much for their  carvery   If I m paying you     for half a duck can you cut it up for me damnit   Other than having to carve our own duck at the bar  I absolutely adored that dish  Would get it again and again  Does duck go with black truffle mayo  Oh hell YES it does  This is the food stuff of low carb dreams     Overall cool atmosphere  decent set up for watching games  fair drink prices and fab food menu  Service was great  Look forward to trying more goodies from the food menu in the future   Every order I saw pass us by looked amazing ,4,2010-06-27
The Lobster Rolls and Beer Battered Pickles we re awesome    I will most definitely return to this place   Prices are descent   The outdoor area is great to enjoy your food and do some people watching ,5,2016-03-13
Don t waste your time or money   You will easily find something better    Overpriced       for glass of beer   Poor and slow service         minutes between each siting of our server   Nothing tasted fresh    Duck buns were too salty  Sliders  buns were dry and beef was flavorless  Fish and chips was nothing special  have had much much better and paid far less ,1,2012-09-24
Pop into if you want something good and semi in a rush  I ve been eyeing the Bloody Mary for awhile but not quite sure it s worth the price  It s purely a novelty but exciting seeing it come your way  The lobster rolls    were buttery and filled with ample amount of lobster meat  We subbed the chips for fries so be sure to get the garlic aioli for dipping  The mac n cheese was creamy with an added crunch from the breadcrumbs  It s a pretty large serving that s perfect for sharing ,3,2017-02-05
Pretty decent happy hour twice a day with    oysters and    sliders  I liked the decor and vibe of the place and didn t feel completely ripped off like I do at so many Las Vegas joints these days  I m looking at you  Nobu    It s very casual in here with a sports pub kind of feel  but it wasn t all bro y or too loud  A pleasant place to park it for a while with a drink and some snacks  I did indeed partake of the happy hour oysters and sliders and they were delish  When my friend and I saw their dessert specialty Stephanie s Bread Pudding we had to try it  I mean  it had to be good with that name  right   P Well it was pretty damn good  even if it had the Cap n Crunch cereal on top  see photo   I m not a huge fan of that cereal but in this case I didn t mind it  Definitely wouldn t mind coming back if in the area again ,4,2013-07-26
Great vibe at this upscale gastropub located in the Crystals mall in City Center   Extensive beer selection  although there were quite a few that were more mainstream    The bosteels karmeliet       ABV  had a strong honey and citrus flavor that was quite nice   Went with a large group so had a good sampling of food  Apps    Dirty Chips   a huge portion of kettle chips with bacon  blue cheese and fried chicken livers   Pretty good    Welsh Rarebit   wasn t quite sure what this was besides cheesy bread    Lobster Poppie with yorkshire pudding and creamy corn   yummy   Entrees    Fish   chips   two large pieces of beer battered fish with large cut fries   pretty good but may have been overly hyped   Swordfish enchilada   really good ,4,2010-12-21
Came with friends on St  Patrick s Day to enjoy some craft beers   If you check in with Yelp you get a free Bud Light   You can also get up to   free beers      or less  if you are brave enough to chug them in under the time allowed by the bar top hourglass   ish seconds    Happy hour includes half priced pints which run around         You can also get    wings and deals on sliders oysters   Our female bartender was very friendly and made sure we were having a good time ,4,2014-03-25
I wouldn t say there was anything  special  about this place  as it was your basic American Irish Pub trying to be Irish  The food portions were grand  and I will say their food was quite tasty   The service was what I expected   average  so no surprise there  Overall I would say that I was neutral about this restaurant  It met my need to consume food for energy and survival  and outside of that  it didn t  wow  me in any way ,3,2012-05-04
Be weary of any pub where all the servers are decked out in Bud Light t shirts  The lobster roll and clam chowder were tasty  The deconstructed beef sandwich and pickled veg were disappointing and not tasty  Nothing to distinguish it for any TGI Fridays type chain restaurant ,2,2016-10-29
I echo the sentiments of other reviews posted here   average food and mediocre at best service   I ve also worked in the service industry and have been noticing a general lack of skills  motivation and teamwork at restaurants and pubs these days  it s not a problem limited to the Todd English PUB   In my dining experience we were greeted  but then shuttled to a different check in for the patio  For patio seating the hostess was extremely unorganized and it took her   minutes to greet us  her candor was slightly rude  and then another    minutes to methodically clean every open table while a group of patrons formed behind my party  waiting anxiously  The lack of control by the hostesses and wait staff inspired another group to just seat themselves  After    minutes of waiting  we were seated  So far  not the best start to a dining experience   At the table    Our hostess evidently doesn t do place settings or waters  so we waited patiently to be greeted by our server  After about   minutes a busser arrived  provided the essentials and carried on a reasonable conversation  I asked about the crazy large bloody marys and was encouraged by the busser that it was winding down  but if I ordered immediately  our server could procure one for me  Ordering immediately was difficult  We didn t see our server until     minutes after being seated  When i asked about the drink I was given an unapologetic  No  and some body language that suggested I was wasting the server s time   I could continue with concerns  but here is the synopsis  Service   poor  Food   okay  Drinks   okay   For a better experience with similar ambiance  I ve had good experiences at Toby Keith Bar and Hooters ,2,2013-03-29
Went for happy hour   Sliders and chickens wings just O K   Bartender obviously tried to rip me off on check   Charged     for     price wine and when questioned became defensive and got attitude after he changed and bill and threw it on the bar ,3,2013-07-23
We went here for a casual dinner and to watch Dodger game on Sunday  We sat at the bar and even though you could order food there  the bartendress behaved as if she were going out of way to even bring us drinks much less food  She said  hello  and  goodbye  the whole time we were there  about     hours  and that was it   We purposely went early to avoid the rush so a crowded bar was not an issue  Ordered one dish   drinks and left because of the very poor service   With all the choices along the strip  the attitude will not help keep customers coming back  at least not this one  Good luck Mr  English   ,2,2010-06-29
I love Todd English Pub   This is actually one of my favorite places to eat on the strip   Primarily for business luncheons or pseudo social happy hour  but dinner here is just as nice   The staff is  always very friendly and quick to assist   The food is fantastic   I keep trying new things and am consistently impressed     And who doesn t love to see a few tourists try to slam a pint of beer in    seconds to get it free   Like dinner and a show   Classy spot with plenty of people watching   I could sit there for hours enjoying my duck buns and IPA ,5,2012-09-06
I had the lobster rolls  which were overpriced  but damn good  Nicely toasted buttery rolls  and big chunks of lobster  The complimentary tin of popcorn is tasty too  The service was pleasant but a little slow  It is nice to sit out on the patio under an umbrella though  especially when a breeze is blowing  and sneak bits of popcorn to the little birds  The outdoor seating area is between Aria and Crystals  so you can get some good people watching as well ,3,2013-05-21
I have mixed feelings about this place  so I gave it a three   Food was excellent  once they got it right  But fries came out cold  so I had to send them back    Additionally  we had a party of      of our meals were brought out  Then one   minutes later  Then the last after another   minutes  It s pretty standard for restaurants to wait until all your meals are ready to bring them out  so I m not sure if the staff was new or if they were just unorganized ,3,2017-03-09
My son and I have been going here   years in a row a particular week end in January   The place has steadily declined in number of people  quality of food and service   It has changed from great raw bar and food to no raw bar  mediocre food to just poor service   The shrimp was tasteless and limp to overcooked hamburger that came out as a piece of leather   Beer is beer but to try an ounce they were charging     after our tab was already       ring as you go  seems ludicrous at best     As Fran R  said  most of menu is gone and no raw bar   Poor choice and all I can surmise is that people who are reporting good results must be on payroll or being paid per review   Not the same and clearly not place it once was ,1,2018-01-15
Amazing customer service   the staff was prompt and friendly serving our party of   ,5,2016-03-06
There was nothing special here other than high priced pub food with high priced beer  It was very disappointing since our expectations were higher  it being next the the Aria  I can get the same food at the Irish pub near home for about     of the price and a lot less noise ,2,2015-03-03
Props to Todd E   This place is much better executed than his other concepts I ve eaten at   Busy  very popular   Ridiculously high prices for an excellent beer selection  Lobster roll delicious but dripping in butter and sauce ,4,2013-09-25
Solid choice for brunch or lunch   Gastropub fare and raw bar with extensive beer selection  Great bloody marys ,4,2017-11-15
I d give these guys   stars based on my first visit alone but the hostess gave my wife and I attitude when we came back on Friday March    because we wanted to have a few drinks outside    Apparently it s only for people who wish to dine   Really  lady     or   cocktails each add up way faster than a couple of burgers  just so you know    The outside  incidentally  was completely empty since everybody was inside watching the NCAA tournament    We opted to leave and went to Beso instead   On my first visit  however  I was by myself and sat at the bar and ordered the Fish   Chips     I love fish   chips but seldom do I find really good fish   chips  and that s living in the Bay Area right by the Pacific ocean    So where do you have to go to find amazing fish that almost melts in your mouth    Apparently in the middle of the desert  that s where   That was a beautiful dinner and the waitress was really nice  despite the fact that she was evidently quite busy ,4,2011-03-28
My coworkers and I had a nice lunch here while in town for a conference  It was not too hot outside yet so we sat on the outside patio   Our waitress was straight Jersey girl with the accent and everything   She was really good though     For food  one had the fish and chips  one had the tacos and I had T E  P U B  COBB baby field greens  hot house tomatoes   sans eggs   applewood smoked bacon  blue cheese  avocado  shaved red onions roasted corn vinaigrette  scallion aioli with grilled shrimp   The salad was delicious   Grilled shrimp was tasty  nicely grilled   And I always love bacon and blue cheese   I have eaten here on other occasions and sat at the bar for drinks   Definitely a good pub environment with pub food   Lots of beers   Great bartender who helped me find a non beer drink   I drank some sort of cider   It was yummy   Good place to watch a game too with lots of TVs ,4,2016-06-26
Great beer selection  lobster rolls are really good  Hit em up during happy hour to make the prices reasonable,4,2015-05-06
Excellent service  fabulous food  great bar  Don t miss the Welsh rarebit  heaven ,5,2012-06-22
Good happy hour between      The atmosphere was great and so was the service  The food was pretty good  your typical pub fare  My husband took the pint chugging challenge and won himself a free beer haha only in Vegas ,4,2013-10-29
I have to agree with Anastasia H  on this one   This place is expensive and forgettable   We went here for lunch  My hubby had some raw clams  and I had some shrimp cocktail for an app  I can t speak to his clams  but the shrimp were ok      He ordered the roast beef sliders and I had the BLT sliders  His sliders were awesome  and I would recommend those in a heart beat  My BLT sliders  on the other hand  were so sad and disappointing  It was half a slice of super thin bacon between a huge dinner roll with a tiny sliver of a tomato and a whole lotta lettuce    My hubby had A beer and I had A cocktail and our tab was almost      without tip  Definitely not worth the price     Oh  and the bathroom situation is VERY strange  You walk in to a community wash room with an attendant  So not only do you wash your hands uncomfortably with the opposite sex  but then you feel pressured to pay for it ,2,2010-10-21
We came for lunch  a bit hung over I must confess  and sat in the small patio area    I had the iced tea which was a delicious ginger peach and always refilled before I need to even ask     Rather than bread you get some fabulous seasoned popcorn to snack on   it was delicious    My friend and I started by splitting a salad and our waitress was kind enough to have it brought out already split   beautifully presented on   different plates    I had the french dip salad and it was yummy    actually came with a ton of meat so I ended up eating half and then just eating the meat  sans bread  for the second half     Good food  nice atmosphere    Will definitely return on future trips to Vegas ,4,2010-10-14
Made a reservation at this restaurant for two thru Yelp  Got an email confirmation  And    minutes prior to reservation time on the day of  got another text asking me to confirm reservation which I confirmed    Showed up at the restaurant to find that the restaurant was entirely booked for a private party event  Obviously there was no way we were going to dine there  However  what was rude and annoying was that the manager kept on saying that they did not know what had happened  I showed all my email and text confirmations which he took a good   minutes reading thru   seriously it was a short short email  and questioned is if the date was right  He didn t trust us which was offensive  I know what the problem was  You didn t shut off your automated reservation system  you idiot  What s so hard about that   He finally admitted that our reservations were correct but there was nothing he could do  I said I wouldn t mind just leaving but i had tried to make reservations at several places nearby and they were all booked  The one other reservation I had at a different place I had cancelled  So I was left without a place to go for dinner  I asked if he could get me a reservation elsewhere using his connections   That is all I wanted  another place to dine at  He couldn t do much but did call and found  bar seating at Social House    That is how he ended the night  No apologies  thought we were lying and did not own up to the problem  This type of mgmt is reflective of the service level you should expect at the restaurant ,1,2015-02-10
Ok    I love love loved the chicken pot pie last time I was here   So much so that when I returned to Vegas  I made it a point to eat here and get this dish   BUT i was so disappointed      The  sauce  was way too runny  chicken and veggies cooked to a mush  and the crust on top was pre baked  and just put onto the dish at the end    It was so bad but I didn t send it back because we had a show to catch that evening   So disappointing    won t be back due to such lack of consistency ,2,2013-08-12
Loved the beer selection at TODD ENGLISH PUB  They have maybe    craft and rare imports on tap  But holy crap  way too Vegas expensive    Green Flash Palate Wrecker  for example  was     for a tulip      Call me cheap  but that was too much  Even for Vegas       stars,2,2014-04-15
Food is great  service is horrible  I wouldn t come back here if you paid me  Waiting    minutes for a drink in Las Vegas is unforgivable  especially if they make you chug your  outside  drink before you sit down ,2,2015-02-09
Their buffalo burger was to die for  One of the best burger s I ve ever had  While in Las Vegas I stayed at Aria  which is right next door  and I have to admit I ate here twice during my short   day stay  There are tons of delicious restaurants in Las Vegas  which I think only attests more to the deliciousness of their food  They have a great happy hour deal  which is     off all beer pints and    sliders  I believe their happy hour is from     pm  The first time I went there I also got the fresh oysters with the dipping sauces and even though I m not a huge seafood fan  these oysters were out of this world  One note of caution is to watch out for their fresh horseradish sauce that comes with the oysters   I added a little too much  which was hardly anything  with my first bite and my nostrils felt it      Overall they have a GREAT assortment of craft beers  the food is excellent and it is all VERY decently priced for a Las Vegas restaurant  Highly recommend this place  ,4,2015-12-14
We had a large group and made a reservation   We were seated promptly and service was pretty good   Food was pretty good as well   Beer was more expensive than it needed to be   I will say it is in a hidden unexpected location but for the most part worth the walk into the mall   Las Vegas use to be a fairly inexpensive trip but anymore they take every penny from you in the casino and out ,4,2015-11-24
This place was overpriced for the quality  Sporadic lunch service didn t make it any better  Todd English is a talent  but this place is a standard pub with jacked up prices  Sorry guys and gals ,2,2016-01-27
Todd English PUB has a lot of things going for it   great location in the City Center  great deals for happy hour  awesome beers on tap so you can make a nice flight  and beers are listed with brewery and location too which melts my cold  cold heart of ice   a beer challenge which I WILL accomplish sometime in my life  anyone know how to do this whole  open your throat  thing I keep hearing about    and I haven t tried the food  but the menu looks promising   It s a must see for beer lovers in Vegas   Go there ,4,2012-08-05
The lobster rolls were incredible   Be careful though  the waitresses beer recommendation was        a glass  but to tell you the truth worth it ,5,2010-04-17
Always make this a must visit when I come to Vegas Great food Great beer Great oysters that are only    a piece   If you are looking for a fun place with a lively crowd but not overwhelming this is a must    Food is always outstanding,5,2014-09-17
Nice place  Good food  excellent service  yard high beer   good place to check out ,4,2011-12-28
This place rocks   Literally  if you don t like good somewhat loud music you should go elsewhere   The food is always well prepared and tasty   Beer is ice cold and a huge selection   The service staff are well trained and everyone one of them are awesome   Special shout out to Melissa  Dana and Charlie   You guys are incredible ,5,2016-02-12
HEFTY  Like eating a mimosa brunch buffet wasn t enough  Girlfriends and I opted for something low key and near the City Center in LV  We hauled out     boxes full of left over food outta Todd s    Todd English P U B is unique for a gastropub being divided up into three categories  The Carvery  meats   The Grill  house specialties   and the Raw Bar  all seafood    Do get     Dirty Chips   A mountain of potato chip nachos  drenched in melted bleu cheese  bacon  and little balls of fried chicken liver   Tasty  but OH MY GAW   http   www yelp com biz photos dn ipqbm  jUz X rDez A select MVU PL K  K Da uDjUJnw   Raw Oysters      each  Simple  delicious  no complaints here   Lobster Roll   Another delicious dish   luscious pieces of mayo ed lobster piled on   mini hawaiian bread type rolls   Do not get   Sadly  my dish of  the     serving of the lamb  http   www yelp com biz photos dn ipqbm  jUz X rDez A select hZ a iO R ssTZHELPDO w Although still noticeably huge  it was chewy and pretty bland  I had a choice of choosing the black truffle mayo  there wasn t enough  synthetic  truffle oil  I tasted no truffle  and apple butter sauce    Also  DO NOT take those dirty chips home  Ever bit into a soggy bleu cheese chip  Not the smartest to decision to take this to go  but if an after club inebriated snack still tastes bad    it s really freakin  bad  We all synchronized the nasty what the eff did i eat face   Don t be greedy and share your food here ,3,2011-10-27
I was heading out after being in the room working all day   So hungry  didn t feel like spending an arm and leg inside the hotel   Headed out toward the Crystal Shops and this is the first restaurant I saw   I walked by  then walked back   I saw a sign for their Happy Hour and it included oysters   of all things  oysters   It was beckoning me     We were seated right away when we walked in   This place has a lot of seating   Very nice and open space  you can see into the kitchen  nice    We ordered off the happy hour menu  sliders which were like    I think  wings which were     some fries and I got oysters which were      Everything we got was so good   I asked for the wings to be cooked crispy  I can t stand slimy wings   They were crisp and flavorful  couldn t believe it  It was the whole wing  it was separated  which you rarely see   The fries were great  the oysters were good as well   My mom got a milkshake which she said was very delicious   Great price  service was good  not a long wait  it was clean    Overall  I d definitely come here again   I wish there was one closer to me ,4,2015-10-17
The short description is the food is bland  and the only reason they are in business is because of their location and ability to lure ignorant tourists   My wife had a burger that appeared to be a frozen patty  It tasted as flavorless as a shoe   Any fast food burger would destroy it in a taste test  I defy you to find a worse burger in America   The rest of the food is only slightly better  simply because it s not possible to be worse ,1,2017-10-03
This was cool looking place with absolutely amazing service  I had a Todd Bloody Mary which was very good but way over priced         I had the Chicken Sandwich        for my entree and it came with a ton of fries  I ate a bunch of them and it looked like I hadn t touched them at all  They are good fries  dense but good crunch  The sandwich was good  had a sweet honey like sauce  The breading was different than most normal fried chicken sandwiches  The size of the sandwich on the other hand was quite small for the price  They gave us free popcorn which was nice and I did get to try their buffalo wings which were perfect but you only get   wings for        ,3,2017-09-20
In all honesty  I was very disappointed  Not only with the food being below average but with the terrible service  not the whole staff  our server specifically  Nicole I believe was her name   We made reservations  as we were a large party celebrating my sister s birthday  The server kept pushing a round of shots for the birthday girl after we turned them down   times  we finally agreed   yes a whole    dollars a pop for  a group of       She then tried to up the sales again by mentioning that our food would take longer since we were large party so we should get appetizers  Why would you announce that you are incapable of providing for a large party effectively  And it s not really true that appetizers are quicker than entrees    She then brought out a birthday cake and sang to my sister even though no one requested this or ordered it  and then put a    charge for the cake we never ordered   The ultimate worst part of it all  was the way she handled our check  I ve been a server for   years and I know what a pain in the     it is to split a check a million times when you are busy and no one tips right and its a huge old mess  However  under the circumstance that the bill is close to a thousand bucks  I really can t imagine why anyone would want to max out their card in vegas  Especially since it was not very busy  there is no reason to make a big fuss  We had mostly cash and   credit cards  This is easy enough  I ve done it a million times for checks that are not even half that amount  Yeah it sucks  but you do it b c you get an automatic gratuity even if you are an awful server   She complained over and over about how she couldn t do it and how the bartender had to do it and how they don t like to do it  and how its so complicated     give me a break  You swipe the card  type in the amount  rip it out of the printer  and stick a pen in the book  If you have other things to take care of  politely state  I would be happy to do this for you  but we are busy with other guests so please keep in mind that this may take up to    minutes  is that okay with you      You really think we re gonna tip over the auto grat when you do not want to do your job  Try again lady ,1,2011-06-30
What is one to do if you re in vegas for an extra day waiting on an airplane  stretched nearly to the end of your budget  and you want a cheap place to knock back a couple pints  Head to this place  They ve got a rotating   dollar  keg blow out  special  and the beers are pretty good   Granted  even being in vegas  it s  really  hard to justify    bucks for a pint of their normal selection  even if it was from my favorite brewery back home   As for the food  passable  but not really fantastic   What was however  was the service  Aside from another meal we ate on our trip that cost roughly   times as much  we didn t get better service anywhere we went  In fact  I don t know if the   star joint we hit was actually any better  They ve got some really friendly people working  happy to keep serving up pints  and more than happy to bs during slow moments   I m going to have this place in mind the next time I m in town  don t have my company card  and want a pint or two ,4,2012-05-10
This is a pretty decent stop when you re in the City Center  They have a huge selection of beers  and they have peanuts on the tables  I don t know why  but I love a bar where you can throw peanut shells on the floor   but I digress    I ve had the burgers here and tasted the fish   chips  Both were really good  flavorful  and filling  Of course  the prices are high as well    The service  at the bar at least  lacks a bit because they have       people assigned to one section  This creates a lot of chaos and interruptions  when you ve just told one server something and the next guy comes and asks you  and then another one    If you go  sit at a table for a better experience ,3,2011-08-16
Great food    extensive beer menu  and I m not a big beer drinker     fantastic service    was here with colleagues from work during a trip to Vegas  Had the CBLT and loved it  Will come back   ,4,2013-09-28
Alrighty  let s be real  it s a gastropub  You go here because you want something to sop up the alcohol floating or about to be ridden in your system  If you re wanting haute cuisine  it shouldn t be your destination point  But then again  if you re in Vegas and you re wanting haute cuisine and then decide to go to a place with the word  PUB  in it  then you re totally off the radar and need a tour guide or something  But I digress      P U B is one of my total mainstays when I m in Vegas  Now granted  I have somewhat of a blurred point of view regarding Vegas seeing as how  my family lives there and I m there practically there half of my year  but I have to say  I rarely have found a place in Vegas where I crave a specific thing over and over again  And it has got to be the Dirty Chips at PUB  Think about how mind blowingly amazing it must have been for Todd English to put THAT together   b w you and me  it HAD to have been after a night of him being stoned off his mind or something   House made kettle chips  blue cheese  cheese sauce  pancetta  green onions  and fried chicken livers  yes  you heard me correctly  fried chicken livers  It is like a stoner s fantasy  But even if you re not a chicken liver fan  the chips are to die for  I mean  I would actually kill for them right now  Really  No   really    Other than that  everything else I ve had there has been delicious  The Pot Pie  The Shepherd s Pie  The Onion Rings  Now I didn t have that all in one sitting    what am I  A heifer  But the true nature of the PUB is the chill atmosphere and to top it off  and amazing selection of beers  I highly recommend sitting at the bar to eat and you can get some one on one edumacation about some of the beers and sometimes they serve limited quantity  hand crafted beers  and you can sometimes ask to taste some  To top it off  they actually have a great wine selection too  For those non beer drinkers who don t feel like being gassy  Cause in Vegas    sometimes gassy is NOT classy ,4,2011-10-10
The  All about Mary  signature drink is exactly why I came to Vegas   Stacked with a bacon cheeseburger slider  chicken wing  shrimp  mini corn dog  stuffed olives  celery  green beans  asparagus   salami  cheese  lemon   lime  my quest for the an outrageous meal drink has ended ,5,2016-05-15
    for a pitcher of Strawberry Lemon Mojito was a total rip off  The pitcher came half full of ice which totally diluted all the buzz we were hoping for  The oysters were also dry  Rather disappointing ,2,2012-12-11
Great experience  Drinks are delicious but a bit pricy at        per cocktail but it is Vegas   the Lobster rolls were loaded with lobster great dish  The roasted chicken pot pie was not your traditional pie the filling was too cheesy for my taste and the biscuit topping was dense and lacking that flakey texture you expect  Perfect place for large groups   Oysters are fresh and the house made horseradish sets em off     each Hostess seemed highly stressed was very short with us  Our waitress however was very friendly and attentive ,4,2014-03-16
Great service  Perfect menu for a pub  Really good beer selection   Fish and chips  okay but fish was a bit soft to start and complete mush before I was finished  Mushy peas on the other hand were perfect all the way  Others had the burger and wings and both were on the mark ,4,2014-05-27
My wife and I had lunch here after a long walk down the strip from the Wynn   They have an excellent draft beer selection   They also have daily themed oyster shooters   I had the chicken pot pie and my wife had the fish and chips   We both agreed it hit the spot after a morning of walking   Would definitely come back again if hungry and nearby ,4,2011-01-19
Our go to place for consistently good food and a great craft beer selection  My favorite are the Lobster Rolls and you can t go wrong with their oysters or jumbo shrimp off the Raw Bar  The chicken wings are also near the top of the best in town list  Sit at the bar for the best service and active conversation ,4,2014-11-24
Great food and great atmosphere   The bar staff was outstanding especially Aggie  Agata ,5,2017-02-01
A big reason I m giving this place five stars is because of the excellent service  That s not to say the food isn t good as well  it is    but the service our group of about    received here for a birthday was just awesome    Like I said  we had a group of     which can be daunting  The birthday girl  who had made a reservation here months in advance  had called in shortly before we were coming and ordered several appetizers which were waiting for us when we arrived  There were two long tables that were next to each other where we were seated  and each table had onion rings  which were delicious     dirty nachos   think nachos w potato chips instead of tortilla chips   which were also delicious  and honestly I can t remember the third appetizer  I m not sure if they did something special for our group or not  hey I just showed up and ate what was ordered   but if these were the normal portion sizes for appetizers they re HUGE    Now this is where I say the service was awesome      Shortly after our entree orders were taken a small group of us had to get up and leave to take care of some of business for the birthday girl s big night  the Vegas club scene is a pain    We expected to be gone a short time and by the time we d get back our food would have just gotten there  Well  we were gone much longer than expected  Without any questions asked  nobody from our group said anything  our waitress  I m assuming she got permission from the higher ups  said she would remake our food since we were gone so long  I kind of felt like an a hole  but the restaurant was beyond nice for doing this for us    Oh  as far as what I ordered I got the West Coast Burger  which is essentially a Turkey burger w bacon  sprouts   avocado  It was delicious and tasted very fresh  The fries that came w it were delicious as well  Oh I also had a couple of pear vodka cocktails which were refreshing  a bit sweet   but refreshing    I would definitely come back to Todd English PUB when back in Vegas  It s a nice restaurant and the prices are fair for the quality   portions ,5,2011-06-13
Food was decent  slightly better quality bar food  The beers were good and they have a big selection  Good thing I got a pre selected beer flight because I wouldn t have been able to decide what to order ,3,2013-09-18
Amazing beer selection  Nicest bar we found the whole time I was in Vegas  Also if you can drink a beer in less than   seconds it s free  Great American food and excellent staff  If I ever go to Vegas again  I will definitely come back ,5,2014-03-18
Great spot   great beer   good staff   Try the prime rotisserie sandwich you won t be disappointed  Oh    Almost forgot the lobster rolls are AMAZING  Enjoy the outside patio in the winter time is fantastic ,4,2017-06-09
Stopped in after seeing La R ve and on my way back to my room at Vdara  It was later in the evening  so I just wanted a beer and something to ensure I wouldn t get hungry in the middle of the night  Well  I did get a beer  but I ended up at Jean Patisserie for some cold sandwiches after the laughable experience I had at P U B   Initially  my server came across like a pretty decent guy  but after a short time he seemed to be bothered by mother and I  We were obviously not a priority to him by any means  This was very clear when I watched him pick up my drinks from the bar for a moment  place them back down  pick up another party s  and walk out onto the dining floor  This was also very clear when he served us our appetizer before finally retrieving our drinks  Wtf  Is he new  No restaurant I ve ever been to has thought that was the acceptable order service  I highly doubt that one founded by Todd English would feel differently   My appetizer of fried pickles was also ridiculously soggy  So much so that even though I was very hungry  I ate two bites and couldn t bring myself to take another  Sitting under the heating lamps too long while my server socialized with other  more familiar  patrons  That s my best guess   Finally  when I decided I d had enough of P U B  for one lifetime  I ended up having to tell the bartender I wanted my check   minus the nasty pickles   because the server had put my table on ignore  It was like he thought   Hey  they got their drinks and pickles  What else could they want   He actually walked past once without a glance since setting down the drinks  but that was all I had seen of him for       minutes  Again  no restaurant I ve ever been to has thought it acceptable for a server to not ask how everything is shortly after serving it  But perhaps I ve been living on a different planet  or in the Twilight Zone or something   who knows     To summarize  This place sucks  With all the places to get a drink and bite to eat just in Aria alone  I don t understand why anyone would ever go here unless by mistake  like me  Don t be fooled about this restaurant  people  It s nothing like what you d expect from an establishment boasting Todd English s name  and located in one of the most beautiful hotel and casinos in Las Vegas ,1,2014-01-27
Stopped her to watch a game   it was very busy   and the place was booked fully  however the hostess was very helpful and managed to get a table on a corner for us  Service was great  food was just OK  drinks amazing  Overall a good experience ,4,2015-02-04
Has officially become our first or second stop when in town       has seen me visit Vegas   different times  so this place definitely receives my loyalty   This place is a trendy version of an English pub so you have your traditional pub fare with a luxurious twist  They also have a good selection of craft beer from all around the world  and a    second challenge   finish a pint in   seconds or less and it s on the house  I ve tried it twice with a     success rate  pro tip  try one of the cream ales such as boddington s  belhaven  or guinness   Will continue coming here unless this place takes a nosedive  something tells me that won t be the case   Cheers ,5,2014-02-27
This is a safe bet for food and drink in the Aria area  I ve been here several times at different times of day and prefer their lunch the most  There are just too many places to drink and eat dinner to recommend this place after happy hour  I like the decor and the staff is pretty good   I will say that with loads of hard surfaces  tile everywhere   it does get very loud even at only half capacity  There is also a large bell that rings frequently  so if you aren t into that  go elsewhere    Drinks are plentiful any time of day  I ve only had the beer and was pleasantly surprised by the selection  Their Bloody Mary bar looks sort of overwrought  but it doesn t necessarily look bad  It might be sort of fun if you are into vegetable juice cocktails  I am not     The fish and chips are good  and traditional in style  That means you should be dousing them in malt vinegar and saving the ketchup for your fries  Please do not be the jerk I saw one time dipping his fish in ketchup and complaining that they we re not like fish sticks   it s embarrassing  Keep in mind that portion sizes are large here  so it may be a good idea to split these or any dish with a friend    I went into my last visit here expecting to write a four star review  but have to revise it downward  Yesterday for lunch I had the the CBLT which was not spectacular  It was sort of soggy and strange  although I appreciated the heft of it  I ll return to the fish and chips next time  Also   avoid the waffle fries  They are not good and you will only be sad if you order them  I jump at any chance to eat waffle fries but was sorely disappointed with the bland  shapeless potato chunks that were delivered ,3,2014-08-16
Visited this place Thursday night         around      pm   The restaurant seemed busy but we were seated right away in a booth in the back of the restaurant   My wife and I ordered   beers but they were out of both of them  bummer     Oh well  plenty of others to choose from   We shared a wedge salad  excellent bacon dressing on it   Also had some oysters  which at   bucks a piece were a good value   Wife had the lobster rolls  which were very good   I had a burger with pastrami on it   Cooked perfectly  really tasty   Service was excellent  food was great  atmosphere was a little noisy but it is a pub   Prices were a little high  but it is in a prime location on the strip  and the prices were actually better than all of the places in City Center   All in all a very good dining experience ,5,2012-05-12
This place rocks  Sit at the bar and enjoy fun banter with the staff   Order a delicious beer and the bison burger with skinny fries  Loved it so much here I came back again on my two day trip ,5,2011-04-11
Food is decent but service sucks  Also a bit pricey ,2,2012-01-25
Huge portions of modern pub food  like ahi tuna burger or lobster sliders  Extensive craft beer selection  Upbeat  knowledgeable servers  We ve been there twice  and will definitely return ,5,2013-07-18
I usually time my trips to Vegas to arrive at Todd English PUB for happy hour   They have a nice selection of beers on tap  especially compared to other places on the strip  but they are extremely overpriced   Pints are half off during happy hour  which brings them down to a more acceptable level   My girlfriend loves their lobster rolls and orders them every time   I have tried the chicken parm sliders  happy hour sliders  corn dog puppies  and brisket   All of which I would order again   We have always had great experiences with service as well   Overall  I recommend the place  despite the prices ,5,2012-03-26
One Word   Amazing      We came here for lunch to start the day off  First thing is that they have an outside seating area which is great for getting some air and catching a few potential rays without being overbearing  Also there is a lot of people traffic which is good for those wanting a more exciting spot to eat    Now for the food   I had the fruit waffles and they were outstanding  Absolutely done to perfection  very fresh fruit  The gents I was with had a mix of food and all of them raved about their dishes  Now is this the best place in Vegas to eat  No    but it sure is a great place to have a nice Brunch in Las Vegas ,5,2014-05-29
We saw the menu last time we were in Vegas and had to try it on our next trip out there   We were not disappointed   There menu was outstanding and was filled with unique and elegant twists on the usual  pub grub  one would see on a bar menu   We decided to create a lunch tasting menu so we could sample many different dishes  it was hard to choose    We started with oysters Rockefeller which was exquisite and topped with a fresh aioli   That was followed by an amazingly fresh tuna tar tar on tortilla crisps with an avocado cream to cool down the chipotle drizzle   We finished with lobster roll sliders    they were to die for    which came on a hot buttered bun with a side of coleslaw and chips   Great lunch  can t wait to try carvery menu ,4,2011-06-27
The food was good for bar food  subpar for a gastropub and not what I really expected from Todd English   Hard to say if its overpriced or not  given the mindwarp that is Vegas  but none of the dishes were outstanding   I ve eaten at Olives  one of Todd s other concepts  and was blown away and expected a similar effort here  that just missed the mark   The concept itself is a little confusing  gastropub crossed with frat house sounds like it would be right up my alley   But upon further reflection  I like to keep my meals and beer pong    second beer chug and its free  competitions seperate     Not a bad place for a quick and easy meal  but didn t live up to the Todd English expectations that I had ,2,2010-07-14
Beer was warm and there  famous  fish   chips was a disaster   I d pass and try another place for lunch   The    second challenge  is fun but not worth having a meal ,1,2015-05-31
I m a little torn on this gastropub because the service was soooo awesome but the food was so so  And  the pre  and post  dinner happy hour on all pints and wine isn t a bad deal  Am a newbie to Chef English s food so decided to go with the special that day that seemed to be a fav  chicken panini with heirloom tomatos with truffle fries  The fries are pretty darn yummy  Panini was sorta dry and not very flavorful  In place of the pre meal bread  you get popcorn  I m not a huge popcorn fan so was a bit neutral on that   TVs are a plenty if you re looking to chow and watch  So are the beers on tap here if you are looking for a wide variety  Our bartender  Sheena  and waiter were the best despite how crazy busy they were  Love that   It s hidden in a corner on the second floor of the Crystals Mall right outside the Aria casino  Check it out during happy hour for starters ,3,2012-08-10
This place is way overrated  We came here for brunch   We ordered the Duck buns and brown butter lobster rolls and a side of fries  Started out with two pints of Maudite  heck its Vegas   The service took its time and we had to wait for our food  The duck buns were good and the meat was nicely shredded with a nice dollop of Hoison Sauce  As for the main course the lobster rolls were a disappointment  The meat tasted like it had been sitting for a while and though drenched in brown butter it was missing taste and the portions were small  We split the second pint  The beer selection is good but the prices are high  So for   people without a significant amount of food or drinks we ended up paying over     which is ridiculous for a pub  I guess I am one of the few people who doesn t like gastro pub craze that s sweeping the nation  If the food is done right and a portions are fulfilling I would have no complaints but just jacking up the price while serving mediocre fusion food is unacceptable ,2,2011-08-24
The Bloody Mary was delicious  Main reason for us to go there  Also we liked the Junk chips they were really good  Atmosphere was nice  What ruined everything is when the waitress wrote in the bill how much we should tip her  We were going to tip her anyways and we did but the fact that she wrote it on our bill  Reason for   stars is because of the server soliciting tips  But the food was delicious ,3,2017-07-03
lunch here was tasty  the bangers   mash were a little different than others i ve had  with a mustard y sort of sauce  and the portion was quite generous   i also had a super tasty strawberry ale  the first beer i have ever truly enjoyed  they have a very big selection to choose from  so i guess i was bound to find something i liked ,3,2010-10-12
We arrived right on time for our reservation  hostess said we didn t have reservation even though we showed a confirmation  She  did nothing to accommodate us and actually became very rude  Our party was divided up and put at separate tables  We had all travelled long distances  from Hawaii  Washington  Az and California to attend this party  Ruined by the hostess  The food and our waiter was amazing  too bad we won t ever be back ,1,2014-10-14
    Stars      I really wanted to like this place not having tried a Todd English restaurant but unfortunately this place didn t live up to my high celebrity chef expectations   We started off with the dirty chips which sounded good on the menu  but weren t that good in real life  The chips were smothered in REALLY sharp blue cheese which overpowered the entire dish  The chicken livers that were served with it were fried so much they were nearly burnt  The saving grace of that appetizer were the tomatoes and bacon which tried to cut the sharpness of the blue cheese  but to no avail  The bright side of our appetizer ordering were the raw oysters  They were fresh and the cocktail sauce had the right amount of heat from the horseradish   Now on to the entrees  I ordered the chicken pot lie and the sauce was a little too salty  The pie top was nice and flaky though  My husband ordered the New Amsterdam and I think that was the best dish of the evening  It is basically a pastrami Reuben with a hamburger  It was delicious    My sisters ordered appetizers as entrees  The duck buns had too much hoisin sauce and in the sauteed clam dish my other sister ordered about half of the clam shells were empty  The waitress was kind enough to go to the kitchen and get her more   Overall I would say it was an okay experience  Many of the items we ordered fell short  but perhaps it really depends on what you order  Maybe next time I m in a celebrity chef mood in Vegas  I ll stick to the tried and true DC chefs  aka  Andres  Richard    ,2,2012-06-22
The JUNK CHIPS    thick cut potato chips over a mountain of beef ragu  blue cheese  a sweet and tangy sauce  and scallions  The portions are huge  had we known the size of this appetizer  we would ve skipped everything else  But itt was so good we came back the next day just for the junk chips  Late night happy hour until midnight  terrific deal ,5,2016-03-21
The  Oysters   Still dreaming of the oysters    Briny  still in their juices  not too big  not too small  not fishy at all   Came for happy hour and tried these little beauties   Some of the best  if not best  I ve ever had   You think it wouldn t be hard to get oysters right  but it is       off wine and beer for happy hour   and they have a good selection of both ,5,2014-06-02
Ok at best  Food was mediocre and the prices were even rediculous for vegas  Give it a miss  Hit Firefly  a great Tapas bar just off the strip ,2,2015-02-07
The food is a bit expensive but I LOVE drinking here  They have the funnest beer challenge  Choose from pabst  corona light or one other that I can t remember  They count you down  tip a seven second hourglass connected to the bar  and if you finish your beer in seven seconds or less it s free   Plus  check in here and get a free corona light  Thirdly  their Bloody Mary s are unlike anything you ve ever seen  You can get cheeseburger sliders as one of your toppings  Phenomenal   The bartender Matt is such a sweetheart  He was so attentive and works morning shift  Sit at the bar and if you re lucky he ll take care of you ,3,2015-07-12
To start  the surly crab apple of a hostess seemed annoyed to have to seat us and was generally unfriendly  Then she seated another table and was slightly nicer to them  At least she told them the specials  a courtesy we were not extended    The menu is big  And there really wasn t anything I wanted on it  In their defense  English pub fare really isn t my thing  But we were in the market for a good beer and am appetizer  I ordered the franzin something or another hefeweizen on draft  It was ok  We ordered the junk chips which sucked big time  Messy and way too vinegary  As my father would say  it was a pile of slop    We had two different waiters and they were both really nice  So I give them   stars    for our waiters and   for the complimentary bucket of popcorn ,2,2013-11-10
Expensive burger    dollars  with little taste  Service was very poor not even napkins or flatware offered at the bar  Beer tasteless  Disappointing  Busy place ,2,2013-09-14
Food was very good  Service was below average  Water was not replenished and my beer order sat at the bar way too long  One companions order was not correct  I had to remind our waitress  I thought there may have been some profiling despite the fact I left a     tip  This is my  th or  th visit and this latest is the only time I have had cause for compliant  This should not be a reflection on service generally  just the young woman who served our table ,3,2015-09-18
My third visit here on a business visit  Love the Lobster Cobb  recommended  and the Tuna Burger  Best of all a decent array of foreign and American beers on tap  Great for football  ESPN Las Vegas is in the house  Definitely feels off the strip       and aren t we glad ,4,2014-12-09
Food was great   we had the Caesar Salad  can t go wrong there  and the Chicken Pot Pie  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  especially since it s fall  but we also ordered the Moscow Mule and a Mint Julep  but too much METALLICA    It s a Monday night  The clientele here is a LOT of older convention people  We have been here an hour  Nothing but Metallica  No other artist  Cmon man ,4,2015-10-06
We visited Las Vegas for my birthday last month and came across this place  Me being originally from England knows what a  Carvery  should be like and this is NOTHING like it  This place is great for beers  flights of beers but you d be better off eating before you arrive  It s super expensive and you don t get what you pay for  Hyped up concept        Nuff said       ,1,2015-02-07
I love this place     Made reservations and we were seated right away  The staff is very pleasant as soon as you get into the restaurant your greeted with smiles  It s a huge place with lots of open seating  We came during happy hour which was awesome  We ordered sliders and hot wings which were very good for the price  All and all a great experience ,5,2016-05-27
Excellent Brown Butter Lobster Rolls and Fish Chips  Prompt service and wonderful food ,5,2014-04-28
Good place to go to get drinks  meet a couple of new people  get some food  watch some games  I came last night with my girlfriend and had a great time  I was there to catch one of the football games and although I was there for hours it didn t seem that long  The bartender was great and a cutie  The burger sliders I had were good  The drinks were good  the bartender made us a shot called alien orgasm and that was something new to try  They also have a beer challenge that people were doing all night  Nice vibe  I d go again ,5,2016-01-10
I and my husband went here on a Friday night  The pub is got cool atmosphere so we thought  why not   The hostess went to seat us and someone took our table so she had someone  clean  another table  they left stuff on it and even after the hostess watched me brush off the leftover crumbs  she said nothing nor sent anyone else to clean it again  Service is lacking with waitstaff too  although the waitress started to get better towards the end of the visit  We got the mussels to share and the portion was very ample  didn t look like that many when they first sat it down  and they gave us extra bread to sop up juices  Hot and well seasoned yum  Kind of pricey but it is the strip  it was     for   drinks    shots and the mussels  includes the tip ,3,2012-12-02
This was the perfect end to a tiring day in Las Vegas   good beer  tasty food  and fun atmosphere   We had to wait by the bar for about    minutes before getting a table  but it was fine with us to have a drink and take time to read over the rest of the beer and food menus  They are pretty extensive  so if you can t find something that strikes your fancy  you may need to broaden your horizons a bit     A few people have complained in reviews about the loud music   we sat in a booth by the bar and had no problem with volume  The place was jam packed  To me  that just says that its a popular place and people would want to be there  I ve risked it with other restaurants that looked good on the outside  but my first clue should have been all the empty tables  This isn t the case with PUB   let the always crowded dining room speak for itself  I had the prime rib sliders and oh  wow were they delicious  My husband did one of th DIY sandwich options on the menu   he had just finished the Las Vegas Half marathon  and the amounts of food and beer we got were just what he needed  Sure  the prices are higher than what you might pay at a pub in another city  but for Las Vegas  it was fantastic  If you re looking for a low key  not too stuffy place to have some good food  good service  and good beer  this is it ,5,2013-02-10
The food was not good and was exceptionally overpriced  I had the Brie grilled cheese with a side of onion rings  The sandwich was bland and the onion rings were just bad  think giant and soggy with a big slimy onion that comes out entirely with one bite   My date got the fish and chips which were equally as bland as the sandwich  The duck buns and skinny fries were the only decent thing we had  The do have good bloody marys as well ,2,2014-12-06
It s a nice place to go to to watch any kind of sports or catch any kind of event on TV  It s just a really nice feel to it because of the environment at P U B  It s a really fun place or I had a lot of fun  because I drank a lot when I came here  They have a beer challenge that you can do where if you finish a pint in   seconds  you get it for free which is limited to twice a day  A lot of fun things you can do here and it just puts you in a good mood with all the alcohol going on in the restaurant    The food is a bit different though  The food is a bit average but all the food goes quite well with the alcohol obviously   I would prob come back but I do wish the food tasted better or else it would have been an easy   stars  I would recommend people to drop by if you never tried it and do the challenge which I fail    shh I already had quite a bit before the challenge ,3,2013-06-19
Ate here again recently  this place is consistently great  The buffalo chicken lettuce wraps were the best appetizer I have EVER had   yum ,5,2015-03-03
We ordered the Lobster Roll it was about     a plate for three  My friends love their draft beers and the bottom up contest here  Definitively somewhere you would want to take your friends while their stay on the strip   Beautiful decors and all but I d say they need to have some clean up or fix up to their open kitchen  Where I was sitting I can clearly see some sauce bottles were standing where hey don t seem to belong on a shelve  I mean why show that at a kitchen that is suppose to be seen by all guests    Other than that bill came up to be around     for   beers and the roll  Will give it a try again next time ,4,2017-06-20
Just OK  nothing special  Overpriced for what you get although they do do some good happy hour deals if you are looking for a cheap bite to eat   The service was OK  our server wasn t exactly full of smiles but he was quick in taking our order and clearing away  We also went on a Friday evening and there was plenty of seating available inside   I m glad we wasn t sat near any speakers because the music was blasting out like you wouldn t believe    Good selection of beers if that s what you are in to   I probably wouldn t visit again as there are better places for better prices on the strip but it was worth a try ,3,2014-09-20
Staff could use a little more knowledge   Great that they had a couple cask offerings  as well as a good number of draft and bottle options   Not so great that the bartender knew name of the cask beer  Inverted   but didn t know the brewery  Deschutes   nor the style  IPA     Happy hour    oysters  Decent looking presentation  Silver tray  Oysters  seaweed  horseradish  mignonette  and cocktail sauce  Large format ice cubes  Should be shaved  Total mess  toppling oysters on their side losing all of their salty liquid awesomeness    Glass of cask IPA arrived in an attractive hurricane glass  but both times ordered  it was a complete disaster  Completely overflowed  sticky  attached napkin sadness with glass staged for leaving strategicaly placed bombing run droplets on my pants   Complete shamefullness of a pour  pun   ha   and presentation  Delivered  nd time  even after my initial  insert image of  c mon   really dude  facial expression  combined with an immediate and albeit exaggerated lunge for a stack of cocktail napkins in an attempt to save my smartphone from a night in a ziplocked bag of raw white rice   Overall  it s a great location with some pretty good offerings   Just needs a little more attention to the details ,3,2013-04-03
I made reservations for this restaurant  No one told me that the restaurant changed hands   The food was awful  I should have been told when I made reservations that the place was no long Todd English s PUB  Do not go to the place called The PUB   Bad food  ,1,2017-12-26
A gastropub adjacent to Aria offering drinks  eats  and many screens for your viewing pleasure     We got sliders  wings  fried pickles  and bangers and mash   Sliders and wings were pretty decent   I love fried pickles  theirs could ve been better except it was a bit on the oily side   Luckily the pickles themselves are pretty good and the batter wasn t too thick   We really liked the bangers and mash  and were told that the sausages are made in house  fresh every day   The servers are attentive and friendly  it s Vegas  So you wanna fun      and they do a good job creating a relaxed environment   Being near Aria is a plus   Also  they have a happy hour with specials on drinks  drafts brews  and select appetizers   After walking around  it s a good place to chill while grabbing some bites ,4,2016-03-11
Food   fish and chips were great  Sliders not so good  funky beef flavor  Buffalo wings were less than stellar  Blue cheese wedge was just ok    Ambiance   decent Vegas vibe  slightly boring but it was lunch time    Service  Good  we were seated right away    Prices   high  but it is Vegas    Can t really recommend because there are so many better places to eat ,3,2016-02-10
The only reason I am even bothering to review this place is because it s the only place in Las Vegas where I received terrible service    After having a beer there our first day while waiting for our room the waitress barely would even make eye contact with us to take our order   We ordered fries and they came out cold   There were peanut shells all over the floor   We went back there one night after seeing a show  place was not busy    bartenders RIGHT THERE  we are sitting AT THE BAR  and   miin later no one asked what we wanted   We left     There were so many better bartenders in Vegas   Actually  every one f them was great except for this place ,1,2010-09-25
Well   I ll say this   the food was sufficient enough and I was not hungry when I left as they were large portions  Truly it was good food   pricey as many others have mentioned   but good    Service was not good however  It s just not something you should have to deal with in a Strip property restaurant  I ve been here before and it was when they first opened years ago  Service was also not good then  and I said it would be some time   if ever I returned  Forward nearly   years later and this time I stuck to ordering things like fish and chips and a Reuben   so it d be hard to mess those things up   Pics below   Breaking it down further   myself and my buddy walked into   hostesses that were not even facing the doorway where guests walk in  One turned around and greeted us  The other two continued to face the opposite direction and seemed to be pretending to organize the menus  Seems like as the first people you see   you would like to be greeted properly by the host staff   We were asked if we wanted to sit outside   which we did as it was a nice day   and that also became an issue     minutes before someone with water came over   and quickly hurried himself away  This was even after a server delivered a couple of drinks to the table directly next to us  The server looked in our direction but without any acknowledgement     What s going on   Lol   It became pretty funny at that point  Weary and hungry  we just wanted to eat  When the actual server finally came out   it was right around    minutes     Do you guys want something to drink  Or are you ready to order     We did both right then  seeing this as our big chance      The rest of the meal was pretty uneventful as the server was a bit more attentive than ever before for some reason  He proceeded to tell us how it was a job that he likes because it s casual and makes him good money     Oh cool   I said    lol     We will take the bill when you get a minute   Which he returned with promptly    So overall it s as so many have mentioned   food is good enough  a little pricey for what it is   although well executed  Wouldn t take much to make it just right and a    star  location    Guest Perception IS Reality    Happy Eating   ,3,2015-07-27
Horrible decision for dinner  Fish and chips  prime rib sandwich and sliders were all bad decisions  Go to Sage inside Aria,1,2015-02-28
Todd English is a diamond in the rough   I was traveling solo and staying at the Aria   I was pleasantly surprised to find a place with a bar that I could pull up and take a seat   Excellent wings  salad  and beer choices   The staff is also a highlight of this place   I look forward to going back next time I m in town ,5,2014-02-01
So in attempt to try their Bloody Mary tower I have gone here twice   The first time was on a Monday and of course they only make them on sat and Sunday till  pm   I was too hungry to care so we stayed and ordered lunch   We got the shrimp cocktail  wedge salad and the free beer when you check in with yelp so the wedge salad was good   a lot of blue cheese which was nice but you can t really mess up wedge salad   The shrimp cocktail was the fanciest I ve ever had   Sliced in half and pre mixed in sauce for me   There were mandarin slices as well as some while and green sauce   Sooooo refreshing and bomb    The next trip here was   weeks after and I finally got it     buck for a Bloody Mary   chicken wing   corn dog  cold cuts  cheese cubes   slider   pepperchino  blue cheese stuffed olives and a bunch of celery  The reason I gave   stars was i was so excited for this Bloody Mary that I m sorry to say was the worst Bloody Mary I ve ever had   The food was amazing and the slider was made with this bread that tasted like Hawaiian kings   My fiance ordered bangers and mash which was also delicious   The staff was super nice and friendly and the Bloody Mary girls was super sweet   She even let me take a pics of her holding it   Im Just sad that the reason I came her sucked ,3,2015-09-20
Very popular pub milieu that s a welcome break from the lounge vibe and uber throbbing in most of the other proximate options  Wide beer selection and   with proper Happy Hour timing   reasonably priced  for Vegas Strip  prices  Staff was friendly  Can be cacophonous  especially if high stakes sporting events are being displayed on their many TVs  Sliders so so ,3,2013-06-14
Great lunch spot   Huge portions   The truffle mayo is amazing  and the blue cheese spread very good aswell   I got the sliders and had a bite of the grilled cheese   Both were great   It comes with a huge portion of fries    wish I would have know that sweet potato fries were an option   They looked so good   Service was fast and attentive ,4,2011-08-21
This place was hard to find but we were tired  We got the lobster roll which was served warm and very delish  Also ordered the fish and chips and it was very good also  Fried pickles as an appetizer was huge and tasty ,4,2017-04-23
Well what can I say the rudest bartender ever    Bald fat  tattooed and not enjoying life at all    We actually walked out that s how rude he was oh well lots of other pubs here  ,1,2016-01-22
If it wasn t for Mr  P we would have never come across this nice little pub  You start off with popcorn drizzled with salt and paprika this is free for all     Followed by homemade different pickles paired with an assortment of mustards  I love pickles    My expectations were not to high  but oh man when those lobster rolls came out I was in heaven  They were so toasty and tons of butter with huge fresh chunks of lobster  Btw    this was my first lobster roll  I have been watching the food network and seeing all these lobster rolls places but they are all in the east coast  FINALLY  I found a lobster roll right here in Las Vegas at Todd English PUB and it was delicious    To go along with these awesome little rolls I had a wheat beer named T O D D  the lemon and crispy light wheat flavors went great with the lobster    The chicken pot pie was pretty tasty too  Huge chunks of chicken with a light fluffy  crispy crust  It had a  real  intense chicken flavor    Great beer selection  great true pub food even if little pricey but I thought it was worth it  Very enjoyable    ,4,2010-11-09
This was absolutely delicious  A little more expensive than I anticipated  but well worth it  Their selection of adult beverages were great  Will have to try to go again during happy hour so I don t break my wallet  I had the Chicken Potstickers  my husband had the duck buns  and his booking manager had the soup ,4,2013-02-09
We ate at Todd English PUB for brunch on Sunday  and it was terrific   I ordered Brisket from the carvery and my date ordered an open faced egg sandwich  Both came out spectacular  and much larger than expected   The brisket was seasoned well in an au jus  and was succulent when dipped in their special curry butter   The beer list was also very good  but the drinks were all way over priced   At     pint  the markup is triple what you d find in a normal package store   Still  the selection was very good and despite what an earlier reviewer stated  there is Bud Light if that s what you really want   The location for the pub is nestled between Aria and the Crystals shopping center  which makes it a great location for relaxing away from the bustle of the strip   Our service was also outstanding   Melissa was always friendly and attentive to our needs     Definitely recommend   would have been   stars if the drinks were more reasonably priced ,4,2015-04-21
I originally made reservations for Delmonico  but after realizing that it was just a little too expensive  I canceled and came here instead  I think I made the right choice   It was close to the end of happy hour  so I got a big pint of Stella for half off  Between the husband and I  we got the little corn dogs  prime rib chili  a chicken BLT for me  a burger for him  and he got the chocolate shake for dessert  Everything was amazing  especially the chili  They even honored my request of replacing the arugula in the sandwich with romaine   Hey  what s with the funny look    The service was great  The atmosphere was casual and loud  but not too much  It is a little pricey  but it s the Strip  and you get what you pay for  In my case  I paid for getting stuffed  buzzed  and happy ,4,2013-12-14
I live locally so I have been here often and would be dining here if the food was better   much better   I give   stars because every time I come here the bartenders are always cool   Although  I have never seen the same bartender twice   The last time I was there    nights ago  our bartender was Chrystal and she was very friendly and well imformed   She was on it when it came to working and serving guests so I would give her   stars but unfortunatly she works at Todd English s PUB    I went here because I was craving fish and chips and even though I knew the food was not so good I figured they had to get fish and chips right because it s an english PUB   I was wrong   It was so terrible and since Chrystal was a very good bartender  I shut my mouth sucked it up  later yack it up  and ate what edible parts I could of my flavorless fish and cold over cooked hard chips  that cost       There was a couple next to us at the bar that ordered the DIRTY NACHOS  which looked disgusting  and after a bite or two they returned them    So all in all go here for the great bartenders and the endless peanuts and even a free beer if you can down it in   seconds  JUST EAT BEFORE YOU COME HERE OR AFTER   The food is just bad   ,2,2011-11-17
First off   the Aria CityCenter Crystals complex is beautiful   Everything here was great   from the cold Honey Brown Lager to the BLT Sliders and Brown Butter Lobster Rolls   This was a great lunch and I would not hesitate to go back anytime ,4,2010-11-16
Came here for drinks and to check out the civic center  I had a wonderful time here  Our waitress was adorable and really nice  Their drink menu had so many options and around    beers on tap  Even some local craft beers  You could get beers in pints  yards and pitchers  Also in flights of four  I had the Tenaya Creek Pilsner  a local Vegas brewery  Interesting flavors  very earthy and well balanced    Their menu also looked great  but we were so full from another restaurant  They also give free pints if you can finish them in   seconds  Pretty entertaining  Thought their cocktails were great  which included a    ounce Pabst and a shot of Jack Daniels  Pretty great  Will be back again ,4,2010-06-29
The food here is great  The serving sizes were great  They had a huge tv outside so everyone siting out there could watch the game which was awesome    of us took up a large table and our server never made us feel uncomfortable   people sitting at a table for    He was very friendly and nice all and all will definitely return,5,2014-08-08
Came in for happy hour   p  p   They have quite the extensive beer selection but we were feeling some sangria  Having eaten a huge lunch  I didn t even have food  However  they do have bar snack  I LOVE BAR SNACK  I know  it s silly  I enjoy the simple things  Just a little bit of seasoned popcorn wins me over  Being a local  this is not really an ideal location since its touristy and overpriced  The service was good  the sangria was tasty and hey    your check in gives you a free bud light  I may come back in to try the food ,4,2014-04-20
The atmosphere is relaxed and fun  Nice big bar with over    beers on tap  Our waiter was cool and attentive  Beer was yummy and the food was of good portion and yummy  I had this super tasty burger  forgot the name because I was drunk but it had burger meat  pastrami  and swiss cheese  nuff said,5,2010-07-09
We stopped here both trips to Vegas in        A fun bar with great pub food   Fast drinker   Try the   second challenge   down a beer in   seconds and its free   Needless to say   I did not attempt  but my husband did with time to spare    Not sure I should be proud       Anywho   service was a little on the slow side  considering we were in during the early afternoon and it was not very crowded   However  did enjoy the bartenders recommendations  even though he doesn t drink    He goes on what is popular and word of mouth   he was right every time   Lobster salad sliders for lunch were to die for     mini sliders toasted with butter and huge chunks of sweet lobster   served with a side of homemade kettle chips   nice crunchy and delicious   Very happy with my meal choice  a good stop in Vegas ,4,2013-12-30
I really enjoyed my experience at PUB  The atmosphere  the service  the drinks  and the food were all great  Here s the breakdown   ATMOSPHERE   Very high ceilings and plenty of windows in the front  The bar is really gorgeous  with floor to ceiling bottles  The chairs  in bright red leather  were very comfy    SERVICE   Bright and friendly  Age wise  it s a young group of servers  which is always a mixed bag  but everyone here was friendly and smiling and knowledgeable  Our server was really attentive   DRINKS   An overall fantastic list of draught beers from all over the world  and though the prices are a bit steep  the list is high quality  Our water glasses were kept full    FOOD   Be forewarned  The portions  ALL the portions  are huge  We began our meal with an appetizer of Dirty Chips  which  going with the PUB theme  should have probably been called Dirty Crisps  because they were not fries  but chips  and chips are fries in    wait  Guh  I lost it  No matter  they were VERY crunchy and delicious  covered in some sort of green aioli and garnished ever so lightly with Fried Chicken Livers  I m not a huge fan of liver  but wow  these things had me losing my mind a little bit    The Lobster Bisque was exquisite  Not too creamy  but plenty rich  topped with a flaky puff pastry    The main courses were all superb  The Chicken Pot Pie was creamy and and filled with huge chunks of chicken and topped with that gorgeous and impossibly light puff pastry  The Brown Butter Lobster Rolls were as good as they sound  and there was no skimping on the lobster  Shepherd s Pie was gravy licious  and the large fellow who ordered it could barely finish half  try as he might  I ordered an open faced Lamb Carvery sandwich with Horseradish Sauce and Pineapple Mint Sauce  The Pineapple sauce was non descript  but the Horseradish knocked my socks off  I am used to things not being spicy or strong enough  but as I wiped away the tears as the last wallop of horseradish pulsed through my sinuses  I knew I had found a place that understands me  I was significantly more judicious with the sauce after that  The lamb was cooked perfectly   We didn t get a chance to try the desserts  much as we wanted to  No one had any room left   This will become a Vegas tradition for me ,5,2011-01-10
Lots of TVs  and good food  They have an expansive beer selection  and I was smart enough to do a beer flight  OOOOhhhh yeahhhh  It was great  The oysters here tasted fresh too    The place was crowded but my friend and I were able to be seated rather quickly  I had the New Amsterdam Burger  It was okay  but not memorable  it was practically a Reuben burger  which i ve had before at another restaurant  The place can be a bit loud   Overall its a nice place next to the Aria  But I think for the price i ve had better joints ,2,2013-10-04
I came here years ago on business and it was delicious  This time when I came  it was no different  My friend and I were looking for something to split and our bartender Lawrence recommended the lobster rolls  AMAZING  Filling for the both of us gals  As far as beer was concerned  I ordered a glass of Dog Phish Head IPA  and my friend ordered an irish car bomb  They filled the guiness almost all the way to the top  and my friend started chugging  All of a sudden  the bartender flips an hour glass light thing on the bar top and she was done chugging it before the sand reached the other side of the glass  so she got it for free  I guess it s called the   second challenge  I truly enjoyed that moment of our visit   Beers are pretty expensive      for my glass of Dog Phish Head  but the ambiance and the staff are pretty awesome so I will be back ,4,2015-04-02
     on a Friday night and we were refused service as  they were closing soon   I asked if this was new as the hours posted say        and was told that  they were closing soon  and couldn t seat us  what incredibly poor sustainer service  Doesn t matter how good the food or drinks are if they can t take care of people ,1,2016-08-13
Food is expensive and tastes like      I seriously had better food from swansons microwaveable dinners  Plus the beer is very expensive and you get barely any  Way better places out there ,1,2011-09-27
I came in here late night with friends super cool vibe and the bartenders were super friendly  Drinks were reasonably priced for the tourist trap location they are in    The food was pretty darn good for bar good and was served rather quickly and they continually checked to see if anything else was needed ,4,2016-07-04
I had their Ahi Tuna Tar tar   Duck buns and crispy beer battered fried pickles  They were absolutely DELICIOUS  My brother in law had the beef slider with a bucket of shoe strings potato chips  which is French fries    and of course  no surprise  super good burgers   Try and you won t be disappointed   ,5,2015-07-18
I went here twice when I was in Vegas and loved it both times  I used to frequently go to the Todd English Food Hall in NYC so when I saw that he had a restaurant across the street from our hotel in Vegas  it was a no brainer  The first day we just came for happy hour snacks  They have    wings     oysters  and    sliders which is a great deal  The sliders were lacking a bit but the wings and additional onion rings that we ordered were great    Then we went for brunch which was the real treat  I ordered bagel TACOS which were so different and unique and sooooooo good  It was a bagel shell fried into the shape of a taco shell  but it was light and flaky at the same time  It was filled with sour cream  capers  and smoked salmon  Literally amazing  I also LOVED the fact that they had a bloody mary bar with custom bloodys  but they were a bit pricey for me to try      for the drink with   mix ins   If your looking for a good brunch in Vegas  which Vegas seems to be lacking in compared to NYC btw   then definitely come here ,5,2013-07-31
For working in customer service for years  I would say this was one of the worst display of customer service I have experienced   We came in for a drink before a show and sat at the bar  where we were ignored for    minutes while every single person around us got waited on   Believe me  I am not an impatient person as I have worked in hotels and stores most of my career   So I get the craziness and can imagine Vegas is amplified but not even an acknowledgment that we were sitting there and someone would be with is shortly left a bad taste ,1,2015-07-12
On my second trip to the P U B   I was sadly disappointed to learn that my beloved Fr li strawberry beer had been taken off the menu  We actually almost left  because that was kind of the only reason we went back  but the waitress brought me a sample of a raspberry beer and I decided to stay   The raspberry was good  but it s no Fr li    This time  I had something from the carvery section of the menu  and I would definitely make that decision again  I had roasted turkey breast with challah and two sauces  blue cheese fondue and truffle mayo  I ate every last drop of the latter  it was so fantastic  the blue cheese was delicious  as well  I sat at the table  drinking my fruity beer and happily making my own cheesey  truffley  turkeylicious sandwiches  It was awesome ,4,2011-03-25
      stars   Overall I enjoyed our experience here    Decent beer list  but a bit pricey   Portions are huge   I got the cblt which was good but my bottom roll bun was super soggy from the beginning which I hate   The service was a bit slow for my liking  but nothing terrible in that regard   Would definitely be back to try it out again ,4,2015-04-04
I would love to be able to write a review of this pub and restaurant  but we have gone twice and been turned away twice  both times by hostesses who refused to be accommodating  In December  we were not seated  although there were open tables  Last weekend  May     we stopped by mid afternoon for a beer and snacks on the patio   One hostess greeted us after about   minutes  a long time for a patron   then left to  ask someone about outdoor seating   never to return  The next hostess greeted us      minutes after that as if we had not already been greeted  We asked for an outdoor table and she said  we don t have any   We asked  what about that four top that those people left while we have been waiting   She said if we were willing to wait five minutes for it to be bussed  we could sit there   What s another five minutes   Five minutes later  we interrupted her  only to be told that there weren t enough servers on the patio to seat that table  Management  convince me to try again   There are plenty of places in Vegas for a beer ,1,2013-05-11
Went here with a group of    others for St  Patricks Day   The place was great and accommodated our party without any trouble   They have a massive beer list and a full bar  so no shortage of alcohol options   Food was really solid too   I went with the sliders and fries   both very good   Other people were raving about the duck buns and hot dogs   You really can t go wrong with this place   Really convenient if you re staying at any of the hotels in the city center  or even on that end of the strip   It s open late and they have tons of TVs for sports viewing   They do play loud music over the speakers throughout so beware if that bothers you   If you slam a beer in less than   seconds  it s free   I ll definitely be returning in the future ,4,2011-03-22
I ordered the chicken parm slider  Mmmm  it was ohhkay  The crispy chicken wings were tasty  I wouldn t go out of my way to eat here again  Our server was very nice though,2,2013-11-07
Came here with a group of coworkers who were planning on watching a game here  And we even verified it would be on before making the reservations and the manager Mike was completely unprofessional about addressing changing the channel to the game  He was humiliating and in my Boss s face yelling and completely unprofessional  Who gets In a customers face and blatantly yells at them  We were all humiliated and disgusted with the way he handled the situation  Wouldn t recommend anyone come here  They were out of most things on the menu and it s only Thursday night on one of the busiest weekends of Vegas  The server was very sweet through it all and I felt bad she was stuck in the middle of her horrible boss and customers ,1,2016-06-17
Really enjoyed the pub today for lunch  My husband and I shared a few different appetizers and everything was delicious  Little expensive but isn t everything in Vegas  Kinberley was our waitress and she was very good  We enjoyed her  Great experience I would recommend ,5,2013-06-26
My friends and I got a little bored with the food options while staying at Aria and decided to venture out   I wanted to find a place that was relatively pretty close and not too pricey   We checked on Yelp and saw that Todd English Pub fit what we were looking for  so decided to give it a shot   Arrived at the restaurant and who knew but Todd English himself was actually in the kitchen cooking and filming that night   How exciting   so Todd himself actually prepared our food  or at least appeared to    We started with the oysters   Thy Oysters were all from the Northeast and were a very good quality for the price  Also ordered the dirty chips which were a huge appetizer and very tasty   It was the perfect blend of cheeses and tomatoes only complaint was that the beef was a little overcooked and dry  I was tickled pink to see they offered mini corn dogs bites so I ordered a side of them   They were fantastic   however they came with way too many fries   and not enough corn dog bites   The order only came with   or so mini bites and I probably couldve eatten at least twice that  come on people they were bite size    For our mains  we ordered the Chicken Parm sliders   These were a little dry but still very good   The lobster salad roll sliders  very very tasty  also a little dry  and the Grilled Cheese   The Grilled cheese was way too rich  we couldn t eat more than a few bites a piece  Sure glad the   of us ordered and shared    We finished with the bread pudding which was excellent way to filling     Bottom line  we were absolutely thrilled Todd English himself appeared to have made our food  however the food wasn t all that great  It was really cool to be part of the filming experience but everything was way overcooked and far to filling  I would definitely give this place a second shot because the menu selections are fantastic   and perhaps it was just an off night   Maybe Todd was nervose from being filmed ,3,2012-06-12
Food so so  who cares though  The beers on tap here are world class  Fullers ESB  Strongbow  Tripel Karmeliet  Chimay Cinq Cents  etc  Im rating this   as a bar   pub with great taps  I drank with a bonafide British guy and when a guy from Germany or Britain approves of what comes out of the taps that just buttresses that which I already know  the beer here is great   Come on in for a drink ,5,2010-05-01
We came here for drinks and appetizers   We chose the oysters because our waitress suggested them   I loved the vibe in this place   It was fun without being serious or thinking too much of itself since it was on the strip   The food  the service and the ambiance was great   i would definitely come back here when i m in vegas ,4,2014-06-30
Absolutely LOVE their happy hour menu      oysters     wings     sliders  Half off selected wines  sangrias  etc   Originally came here just for their cheap oysters but  tried their delish sangria  Then  since I was there I might as well have some sliders which were extremely and surprisingly juicy  And welll     since wings were just a dollar  I had about    lol  Best     I ve ever spent ,5,2012-05-15
A great bar to go to  The happy hour is the best and the bartenders are actually nice  Also try the bloody mary  You wont have to buy dinner ,5,2017-04-27
A good place ruined by mediocre service   Food   good Lobster roll was very tasty   Came here with my wife and two friends and all four of us liked what we ordered  Price   good A little expensive by  normal  standards but definitely reasonable by  Vegas strip  standard  Atmosphere decor   very good A very good looking place  lively  cozy  with a nice outdoor area   Service    Inadequate We went in for brunch and the inside space was half full  as most people wanted to sit outside  there was a wait for the patio  on this particular sunny day  Our waiter was lacking energy and perhaps lacking proper training   The food was extremely slow   I m not sure whether the kitchen was backed up  doubt it  as they were only half full  or whether there was a mistake    Anyways  as    minutes became         and finally     I knew for sure since I checked in on social media when we were seated  the waiter never came by to explained to us what was happening   We even had to flag him to get more water   As patience was running thin I finally confronted him about the wait   He then said  oh yes  your ticket is next    I replied  can you bring something for us to nibble  I m really hungry    He said  well  do you want bread     Yes  please  we responded   He went back but never came back o bring back bread   No bread  no apology   As we were walking out he called me and said the charge didn t go through   Upon double checking my name and room number I realized at this point we were already   hour past my checkout time  we were there   hour    minutes   This was finally  the first time he apologized about the wait   Las Vegas strip perhaps has the highest concentration of high end restaurant West of Manhattan Island   Get your act together  customers have plenty of options here ,2,2014-05-03
Had the Shepherd s pie over the weekend  Good stuff and did not disappoint  Huge portion   can serve two people   Beers are on the pricey side  but that is to be expected on the Strip ,4,2015-03-11
I came here for my friend s birthday   She wanted to do something chill but had heard about their lobster rolls so that s what we got   Yay   Lobster rolls  nice buttery rolls  perfectly cooked lobster with a side of chips   I m not a huge fan of lobster because it can get overwhelming and tough but they cooked it really well here   Plus the ratio of mayo to the lobster was good as well   Other   Loaded chips  Freshly made potato chips  with bbq beef ragu  cheese and some sort of cream sauce   The bbq in this is definitely strong  Get this if you like the taste of bbq   The beef ragu was scarce  barely had any   One of my friends didn t even know there was beef in it and we had already gotten through almost half   It s a huge order though  so enough to share   I had to ask for extra cream sauce to tame the bbq flavor   Chips were nice and crispy  didn t seem oily   Service  it was okay   Our waitress wasn t that attentive   It was kind of loud in there but it seemed like every time we would try to flag her down or say something to her before she walked off  we were ignored   She also spilled one of our drinks on a portion of a table and never cleaned it up even after she said she was going to come back to clean it ,3,2014-01-22
Packed  which is why it got    But this is Vegas    Great beer selection and seafood stew was very  very good ,4,2013-03-29
The perfect cure for the premature hangover  After a full day of Vegas style pool drinking and an early evening power nap this is was the perfect place to refuel with some Vegas style pub food    Sadly the pre mature hangover meant we did not try the raw bar  We ordered a bunch of things to try  My favorites were   Mac and Cheese   legitimately different than the millions of other mac and cheeses out there  Very savory  Steak Tacos   Sauces were really good  as was the corn bean relish  Other things we tried that were all good  Beer Battered Onion Rings   Big portion Corn Dogs   Yes  awesome   Roast Beef Sliders   tasty fixings  Solid go to for a casual night out in Vegas ,3,2011-07-05
Terrible service  The bartender made no attempt at conversation  He didn t even greet us and just walked over and stood in front of us awkwardly  with a blank stare until we ordered the first thing on the menu  It was dead in there  Finished one mediocre beer and left  Don t waste your time  many other great pub choices in Las Vegas ,1,2017-06-20
The first dining experience in Vegas  I knew the moment I sat down at the bar it wasn t going to go well  Honestly  I should have just gotten up and left  Bar top was not clean  overweight bartender had a blas  attitude and wasn t personable in my opinion  I tried to make conversation since I love craft beer and was interested in trying something local  which unfortunately wasn t an option  Had the tuna burger  which was quite good  probably the only good thing  I d give them another shot  but with so many options in Vegas  most likely not this trip ,2,2015-06-10
Walked around ARIA and chose this place to eat at  Wanted to try Wolfgang but it was closed  Guess they don t do lunch   Anywho  started off with the Flight of fruity beers  YUM  apple  raspberry  peach  and apricot I believe  For entrees we had the Workmans Grilled Cheese and the Double Cheeseburger  I didn t try the Burger but it was inhaled  The fries that come with it are steak fries  They were kind of mushy  The Grilled Cheese was yummy  It was salty and very rich as I only ate half but it was still good  The skinny fries that came with it were delish and crispy   Service SUCKED  SO SLOW  Server was in his own dreamy land  Basically we were eying him the whole time for service and was not efficient at all    Overall  a pretty good food and beer experience  Service was the a major downfall     stars ,3,2010-08-13
I was here on Saturday  We sat at the bar and were lucky enough to have Jared as a bartender  He was by far the highlight of our visit to Todd English  His beer suggestions were on point  and he has me hooked on a new beer  Saint Bernardus  and the shots of Eagle Rare were AMAZING  I can t even begin to tell you how good the lobster rolls are  Thank goodness he suggested them  Make sure you ask for Jared when you go  Because of him we will definitely be back ,5,2015-03-11
This place is awesome  Great atmosphere and amazing food    You have to try the chicken and waffles and most definitely have to try the chicken pot pie  Whenever my wife and I come to Vegas  we always stop by at least once  Highly recommend ,5,2016-02-14
First time at P U B  Had the Fish and Chips and the hubs has the P U B burger  no disappointment here  Fish was flaky with a crispy crust  His burger was perfect   The only reason for   stars was the time spent there   almost   hours ,4,2017-10-19
If you need a break from the    year olds  Bachelorette parties  or stupid drunks period  this is the place to be its a hidden pub inside the Aria  that will give you that reality break you need from Las Vegas Blvd  The food is amazing and is served in very generous portions  They have a lot to choose from from sliders  to pork  to a brie grilled cheese They also have an exstensive drink menu ,4,2015-03-29
I was surprised that this place did not have a higher rating as in my experience it has it all  great food  well made drinks  cool ambiance  and wonderful service  Their French onion soup was the best I had  fries were so crispy and tasty that it was impossible to stop eating them  mac   cheese   amazing  beef sandwich   so tasty  moist and perfectly put together that it s hard to find words to do it justice     A note of caution that can very well be a cause for lower rating   every little thing costs extra  mushrooms on a sandwich     cheese with your pretzels  which are wonderful too        and so on  What s the problem  you may ask  The problem is that you are offered all these extras but are not told that they are for an additional cost until you get a bill which is not right ,5,2017-02-21
What a disappointment  I have a hard time awarding PUB even two stars  the food was that bad  We came in about   minutes to    and were told that we could only order off of the late night menu that starts at     Okay     Wait  let me back up  My husband and I wanted to sit outside  We asked a server in the area if it was ok if we sat ourselves thinking he could just send a hostess out with menus   he gave us a shitty look and told us no way  Jerk    So back to the food   we tried the roast beef sliders  chicken wings and chips  The first order of sliders we received came out COLD  Nothing like biting into cold beef  bun and Whiz sauce to make your stomach turn  My hubs had the wings which were kind of mushy  and very mediocre  By far the best dish was the chips which we ordered with curry sauce even though it wasn t offered as an option on the menu  This is something that I would recommend  although I have a hard time with any pub that doesn t regularly offer chips and curry   even a gastropub should get that one right  And no HP sauce  I mean  seriously      The beer selection was pretty poor for a pub as well  When I think pub  I think selection and variety is key  And by variety  I don t mean Stella and PBR    The only reason why I will award PUB that second star is because our server was very sweet and quickly replaced my cold sliders  requested our special curry sauce  and generally tried to take care of us despite the lackluster food and beverage offerings    Pass on PUB ,2,2010-09-15
The food was killer  I haven t haven t had a  lobster roll that good since I was in NY and Boston  My wife had the oysters and loved them also  Everything looked great on the menu ,5,2012-06-11
There was a time I was blind  I was so confused Run away just to hide it all from you  But baby  you knew me better than I knew myself They say if you love something let it go at    P U B    Judith Hill  what a girl wants cover   I actually haven t been to many of Todd English s restaurants even though he has a ton  I never noticed this place in the past  maybe its new ish  at City Center but it s got a fun atmosphere  We came here for lunch and I got to create my own sandwich  You choose one meat  one type of bread  and two sauces and you put it together yourself    Protein  prime rib beef Bread  sourdough Sauces  horse radish   black truffle dip  The putting together part isn t as fun as it sounds  but I guess I understand their thought process behind it  They want you to be able to enjoy the components separately since there was salmon as a choice and some other things  Oysters looked pretty good  didn t try em though  Also our meal came out before they finished shucking them  The sandwich was really good but wished I didn t have to put it together myself  Service was a little weird  but i guess its VEGAS BABY ,3,2013-07-22
Rating is based on service though food was bland  Restaurant was not busy yet we had to ask the busboy who our waiter was  I couldn t tell you one thing about this establishment  Waitress was disinterested and unfriendly  We let the manager know about the service and he offered us a house meal on our next visit  However  we declined  I would not eat at this restaurant again    I had the fish and chips which was bland  Girlfriend had the chicken pot pie which was decent  Would not recommend ,1,2014-03-02
For the beer selection and the waiter s ability to help us navigate it   alone   I give the restaurant four stars   Well done   I opted for fish   chips and was delighted   Not overdone  great temperature  light flaky flavorful fish inside    crispy deliciously seasoned chips   nice  good ambiance too,4,2012-01-17
On a Tuesday afternoon after walking the strip went into the P U  B  for some nice cold beer and some appetizers we had the Junk Chips  which consist of homeade chips with bbq beef ragu and crumble bleu cheese and alioli along with the sliders  which are on the happy hour menu  and the brown butter lobster Roll with Alioli  All very good  Great place to relax and kick back  You get popcorn the second you walk in ,3,2013-10-18
Very well thought through and executed  I ate here twice  Very comfortable  richly prepared food ,4,2010-08-26
As we came in we had a good vibe for this place  It looked nice and the host was friendly    We sat outside because the weather was amazing    The waitress came to take our order and although the restaurant was empty  she seemed rushed     I asked for recommendations and she named   plates on the menu and left    I asked for an expresso who she brought without a plate l  sugar or spoon  I had to ask another waiter to please bring me some sugar  She showed up with the sugar but without a spoon  I had to ask her on a second trip to give me a spoon  Once she dropped the spoon and I was ready to stir the coffee  I saw how dirty the spoon was    We asked for the check  I told her the amounts to be charged in the two cards of the split bill  I went to the bathroom once I came back she had run the cards for the wrong amount    I asked for her to bring me the itemized receipt and mentioned to her that she had run the cards incorrectly  She responded to my comment with   I came and asked again   She should have paid attention when I gave her the cards  Her name is Crystalle E    The food was good  the restaurant is ok  The service sucks ,2,2017-11-14
Love this place  Every time I m in Vegas I make sure I come here  The food and drinks are awesome and the staff is exceptional  Today  we had Aggie sitting at the bar  she was great  She was friendly and provided great customer service  The lobster roll and chicken sandwich is delicious  Highly recommend ,5,2017-01-12
Great experience  Excellent service and food worth the price  We got the half carver sandwich and was more than enough food for one person  Oysters were good as well  Reasonable price for Vegas  Excellent drink selection ,5,2017-05-07
I hold the Duke status for this place  but am fully willing to relinquish it  Like many restaurants that start out so good and degrade into mediocrity  TE PUB has followed miserably  My primary complaint about the place is the attitude of the wait staff and hostesses  The snooty arrogance of this place does not turn me on  There are a couple of friendly bartenders but most of the wait staff seems annoyed at best  One hostess in particular might be the worst in town    Last time we went my friend ordered fries that tasted like they hadn t changed the oil in the fryer in a week    Too bad  I used to like this place it was my go to joint when clients were in town ,2,2011-09-05
First experience dining at Aria last night and I was not impressed   I was with a group of   and we did get seated quite quickly by a lovely hostess in blue   She was so friendly and sweet   It was a busy night but it took forever to even see our server   The hostess had time to refill our waters before we got greeted by our waitress   We asked for several things that they were out of   Annoying and bad planning on their part    Food is very expensive for what you get   I have an issue with paying        for   tiny pot stickers that were good but not great   People watching on the patio was great but I did not enjoy the slow service  bad attitude of our server and overpriced cocktails ,2,2013-03-23
What a great find   Great staff  food  and beer   Beers a little pricey but I guess that s Vegas now   Fried oysters and Tuna tare tare was awesome   Lots of locals seem to come and eat at the bar alone    ,5,2013-03-11
All the walking in Vegas got me pooped    My friends and I came in for an early dinner and to rest our feet  LoL The decor is very casual and of course has a pub like atmosphere with beer in the air and sports on the tubes  The waiter was really chill and nice  He checked up on us a few times and did not let us feel neglected at all  My friends ordered a chicken pot pie and the Amsterdam Burger  We ordered a big plate of beer battered onion rings to share  Out of all the beer battered onion rings I have ever tried  these have the most beer flavor  The only problem is the giant onion ring inside the batter does not rip apart so I m basically pulling the whole thing out and not enjoying the outside  As for me  I ordered the lobster roll that came with not just one  not just two  but THREE lobster rolls    It also came with coleslaw and chips  but I substituted the chips with criss cut fries  The lobster rolls were melt in your mouth    MHMMMMMMMM SO GOOD    I ate TWO of them  The lobster rolls are jam packed with BIG CHUNKS OF LOBSTER MEAT  They are so warm  buttery  comforting  and oOoOoh hit the spot DELICIOUS  The coleslaw was okay and the fries were pretty good  but I would come back just for the lobster rolls over and over again   D,4,2012-05-23
I can only give   stars for I only came here for a beer  The place was nice  we saw it while walking around Crystals   So  my friends   I stopped for a quick drink  like I said I only wanted a beer       And I walk into beer heaven  It may not have the largest selection of beers  but it has a really good one  Our serves was really nice  always on top of things  And the beers were nice and smooth  Nothing could have been better  ,4,2011-06-07
My girlfriend and I stopped in for a few drinks yesterday before a concert  Both of us are Vegas industry workers and she had never been before so why not   I have not had a lot of food from TE but everything I have had has been pretty darn good  What stands out is the amazing selection of craft beer  It would take quite a few visits to even come close to trying everything I want    Yesterday was different than any other experience though   Charlie was our bartender and if there was a Vegas Award for best bartender  I would start a grassroots campaign to get this guy the recognition that he deserves  Charlie was knowledgeable  patience with us as we paced our decisions throughout the menu  more than happy to let us sample drinks and even brought some samples we didn t ask for but just because of our prior decisions  he thought we d enjoy them  Though the bar was pretty much full  we never felt neglected and Charlie treated every other guest with the same hospitality as us    Good food  great beer and Charlie  The word will be spread ,5,2015-06-19
Had a great experience here  Came to watch the NBA finals and The food and service was Amazing  We took Jeff s recommendation and was not disappointed  I wish I could eat more because I now want to try everything he recommended  Definitely will come here every time I am back I Vegas   The lobster rolls are so delish and I am not even a lobster person    If your here in Vegas come by and ask for Jeff and his recommendations ,5,2015-06-12
If wings are    each on happy hour  am I really paying close to     for a dozen wings off happy hour   What are they feeding these chickens   This used to be a fun spot back when they had nickel beer Tuesday and more than gas station beer options for the beer chug promo ,1,2017-11-05
Fantastic time with Lynn and the crew  We went there for lunch both days and had a great time  The beer was immense  as was the food  it doesn t get any better than this ,5,2015-07-11
We re NEVER on the strip unless we have guests  and we had family over this weekend so we took a stroll through the infamous City Center and decided to have a bite to eat at the Pub    We arrive  and it s kind of loud in there  music was on blast  It s a nice place to maybe  drink but the food was crap  We waited about    mins before our waitress came over to greeted us  take our drink orders and then    mins after that  she returns only to tell us that we have only about    mins before the kitchen closes    WTF  why didn t you tell us that when you first approached us   SO  since we were short on time  we asked her  What do you recommend   and ordered whatever she spit out  BIGGEST MISTAKE   EVER    But that s our fault for listening to her  no it s our fault for even coming here  Of course this chick wants a high tip out so she of course recommends  the Lobster Rolls  a whopping      OK  so it s lobster and we re expecting quality for that price  hey  it s City Center  an MGM property  only good shit  right  WRONG  First of all  they are SMALL and consists of mostly bread  They used CLAW MEAT  the tail of the lobster is normally used for Lobster Rolls  That s the worst part to use  AND it was overcooked and chewy  WTH  They re more like shitty SLIDERS than an actual Lobster Roll  It also came with stale chips and some mushy cole slaw  YUUUUUUUCK  Worst     spent    The next thing on our menu was the chili  We like to try the chili when ever we go to a new restaurant  It was good for the first couple bites but after that  it became saltier with every spoonful  We were over the taste but we were hungry so we ate it anyway  My brother   his gf had a sandwich and sliders  both were disappointed in their selections  and again  recommended by the server    We were still hungry when we left this place  it s ridiculous considering the final cost of our bill  The bill was     between   people and I was the ONLY one that had beer  everyone else had water    Damn  it s a Pub  they re trying to be some kind of  High End  Pub  That s an oxymoron  They should think about renaming their Establishment and tweaking their menu  its sucks ,1,2010-05-16
Giving English Food a bad name  As if English food doesn t have a bad enough reputation  The menu here looks very impressive but it just didn t deliver as advertised  Food We didn t order too many items but come on  fish and chips you should have this down  The fish was good  nice batter  nice fish but the service got in the way   fish came out just above lukewarm  and the chips  even colder  Perhaps because they sat under the heat lamp too long  Hard to believe they couldn t arrange for   order of fish and chips and the two other dishes to be prepared at same time  The skirt steak my wife had was also barely luke warm  the bread  sorry crostini served with it was bigger than the steak  And served with Fritos  Fritos   seriously for      The half lb of prime beef my daughter had was probably the best thing we saw  although     and served on a hard hoagie  Desert   Gingerbread was frozen and had to be sent back  After sitting under a heat lamp with a bowl of ice cream for several minutes   see service   The ginger bread  hard as a rock with a strange flavored ice cream was replaced with the Cheesecake  The cheesecake was a bit clotty but overall hard to tell how good bad it was considering it was drowned in the berry compote it was served with  Should be renamed to   berry compote w  cheesecake    Luckily  on e waiter decided to grab this from the heat lamp as our waiter was too busy  chatting   Service Quite funny to watch the manager busy one minute trying to expedite the kitchen and the next minute sitting down at  friends  table stuffing his gob  getting his grub on   Did I tell you this man was hungry  Soon  half the staff felt the need to re kindle with this same table and that s when P U B went to D U D   my kids name for this place   now   Strangest thing ever  some food is cooked in front open kitchen but other item are brought randomly from back  kitchen   and aimlessly dropped off to sit under heat lamps  No coordination which explains the heat issues with our meals  Beer Good selection  overpriced Price Overpriced for what it is          for party of      of which were kids and I was only one drinking    beers   Do yourself a favor and take your money to  nicer place where the food and service warrants the      If you want to give Todd English a try  you re better off with Olives   Final summary  Good beer  shite food  and shite service too ,1,2011-04-21
Sadly  we didn t have a whole meal here  We stopped in for a couple pints and snack at the bar in the middle of a Saturday afternoon    We sat at the large  comfortable bar near the raw bar and where some nice ladies were putting together gigantic bloody marys  Our bartender was quick  friendly  and knew her stuff  We had a couple beers which we hadn t seen in our home market and the mini corn dogs  Holy crap you guys  those were the best corn dogs I ve ever had  We really should have gotten   orders they were that good  It was probably one of my favorite places we stopped in Vegas ,4,2013-09-29
Really good food  Really bad service   I saw a review for this place with photos of delicious looking food and had to try it out  The atmosphere was great   casual  clean and was comfortable enough that I didn t feel like I had to shout across the table to carry on a conversation   Once we got our order  it came out wrong    twice   everything was delicious  Our server on the other hand was totally rude  She stormed off when we pointed out the order was wrong and left the manager to serve our food   It took them forever to check in on us to see if we needed anything  A steady flow of drinks would have helped during this experience    Honestly  I was ready to leave at the beginning of the meal  but it was getting late and we were starving  At least the food was great   I wish I would have checked reviews on Yelp first  like I usually do  Until their reviews on service start getting better   I would wait to try this place out ,2,2010-09-28
The meal was absolutely fantastic  Ordered a Ahi Tuna Tartare for starter and it was sooo good  Also got the junk chips which were delightful  Crispy fried pickles were great too  Tuna Burger cooked medium rare was next and it was seared perfectly on a whole grain bun  with huge amount of avocado and arugula  perfect  All in all  great food  Service was friendly  attentive  and spot on  Well worth the price ,5,2012-09-19
God I love this place  From the design to the food  Todd English is my personal Lord and Saviour  Only thing wrong at times are the rowdy  tool ish crowd of dudes in striped and flannel check shirts slamming down beer mugs and talking about how many girls they think hope  will probably not  bed on their  wild weekend  on the Strip    Skip all the sports stuff on TV if you are not a sports fan  go for the delectable and delicious and certain delirious inducing meats that will send any carnivore into a tizzy  Stopped off here first thing when after I checked into my hotel and it was on like Donkey Kong  Judging by the how good the carvery here is  you will leave very satisfied knowing you have participated in eating another innocent cow    It s all about the carvery and this night Mr English s menu did not disappoint  WIfe and I shared the full pound of Beef Brisket with a side of fries with the truffle mayo  Friend got the ribeye steak  The beef was so tender and so expertly prepared I barely noticed the tools that night ,5,2012-02-26
An update    After four days in a row of my phone calls being ignored  I decided to write a letter to management in a last effort to get my credit to my credit card due to their error  I received an immediate response from general manager Tom Ruesenberg  who was more than apologetic and took care of not only the double charge  but also the correct amount  He had the two transactions credited back to my credit card  which showed up the next day    Not only that  but he offered to apologize to me in person and offered lunch on him  My friend  who was one of the friends the night of the      bad service  went with me on       and Tom was apologetic  cordial and very hospitable  He promptly had us seated in a nice table near the back  and the service was top notch  The manager John came over to the table and also apologized for the poor service  and for my repeated calls being ignored  A free lunch as well as Tom promised   it doesn t get much better than this    Thanks to the GM  this place has redeemed itself  The manager was definitely old school and I was very impressed at how he turned a bad situation into a good one  He went above and beyond my expectations to make it right  Thanks Tom ,4,2011-04-21
Great idea  poorly executed  Took over two weeks just to book a group event  It was like they did not want our money  Two days out management was not even aware of our booking  apparently events director did not share our booking  Promised appetizers in chafing dishes  day of the event we are told the restaurant does not have chafing dishes   Finally got it booked  Food was actually pretty good  Very disappointing in how many beers and drinks that were on the menu  and on the chalkboard that listed beverages  that were not available  These are paper menus folks  When you pride yourself on a beer selection and charge    and up for a pint  can you not reprint a paper menu  From the reactions of the servers and bartenders they have heard this complaint a lot and they do not understand why management doesn t take the simple step to reprint menus  I expect better from Mr  English   Tried to discuss concerns with GM afterwards to offer constructive feedback   he did not see fit to call me back   If you are going as a couple probably no problems  just don t have your heart set on a particular beer  but don t ever try to book a group at this restaurant  you will be very disappointed ,2,2011-01-31
I have dined and cocktailed at PUB three times over the course of two Vegas weekends  and this is the perfect place to wind down  take a breather  or get your game on   Twice I have had reservations  once for    the second time for      and once I walked in solo and asked to be seated at the bar   All three times  my booty was on a seat faster than you can say Jiminy Cricket     The Vegas restaurant scene is extraordinarily pretentious  often without justification   This place is the antidote   Good food  good beverage  good service  good ambiance  although a bit loud   good prices   They have happy hour twice a day  and they are open early for rehab a k a Bloody Mary hour   Don t miss it  even if you have to crawl   You will thank me   The food is basic yet playful gourmet   Don t come looking for molecular gastronomy  because this place doesn t take itself that seriously   Who wants that at noon on a Saturday anyway   Not this girl   The food is pub fare  yet creative   Gluten and dairy free options are clearly marked  if it matters   The servers are friendly  the patrons are friendly  the beer and cocktail selection is good   At the bar  the bartenders facilitate and encourage interaction with other customers   When I came solo while waiting on my room at Aria to be ready  I had a great time joking around and drinking with the honeymooners who were next to me  thanks to the bartender who chatted us up     Any attire will fit in here  just come as you are   Lug your suitcase   Do the walk of shame   Whatever it takes  just come   Don t miss Todd English P U B ,5,2013-10-18
This place is a joke   I will be very specific about the issues that I had during my lunch at Mr Todd English s ill attempt at a restaurant   We arrived at the restaurant around     pm for lunch  There was no host at the host stand  just a busser standing up front twirling a drink tray on his finger saying  she s gunna be right back    The hostess known as  she  didn t return to the host stand for several minutes  We were eventually sat at a table when she arrived back at her post   We were greeted quickly by our server  Samantha  She was plenty friendly  The issue that I had with her is that she was sitting at a table next to us doing nothing but showing pictures of who knows what to other servers while they neglected their tables  and she neglected hers  I had no refill on my soda   She didn t check on us after food was received   The manager did nothing but stand next to the heat lamps and lean the whole time that we were there   The     hamburger that I received had no seasoning on it and the bun was very dry and stale   huge disappointment    Theb     sandwich my wife had was good  but really I could have had it for    at togo s    In conclusion   Service  terrible   Food  mediocre at best    I know that my words will fall on deaf ears  as far as Mr English is concerned  but hopefully the management will try to improve the staff so that people don t continue to leave as pissed off as I did     Don t spend your hard earned money here  You will regret it  as I do ,1,2014-09-21
My review is for brunch though after my amazing meal  i can only imagine how good the rest of the menu is  The service was attentive   The waitress gave us each a Make Your Own Bloody Mary sheet and explained it   I ordered one with bacon and Old Bay and it was freaking amazing   A friend ordered a totally different one and it was equally amazing yet totally different   If you love bloody marys  this is the place  I ordered the Chilaquiles and my boyfriend had the biscuits and gravy  which comes with a frosty pint of PBR    Both dishes were awesome and the portions are huge   Our friends ordered the quiche and the french toast    both also awesome   The best was the  side  of bacon that was ordered   It was more like an entire PACK of bacon   There had to have been at least    strips on the plate    which if you love bacon  is defintiely not an issue   The prices are on par for Vegas and for a higher end brunch   The outside seating right outside of Aria is nice   SInce it is recessed from the sidewalk on the strip  it s quieter than sitting  say at Diablo s or on the patio of Mon Ami Gabi  I cannot wait to visit again and try the happy hour and lunch dinner menu   We still cannot stop talking about this brunch ,5,2014-03-12
OHMYGOODNESS  This place has the best lobster roll I have ever eaten in my whole entire life  I am from Los Angeles  and let me tell you   I would drive over to Las Vegas just for the day just to have some of their lobster roll    The lobster was cooked perfectly  And the sauce  complimented it so well  And the bread    best bread i ve ever had   DEFINITELY GOING BACK WHENEVER I AM IN VEGAS ,5,2014-09-17
This place is l e g i t   A coworker and I wanted to have some regular guy food that did not suck  Todd s English Pub fit the bill  There was a    minute wait for a table but we were able to stalk out two seats at the bar after about    minutes    They have tons of beers to choose from  but we played it safe with a bucket of   Red Stripes which was      hey  it s Vegas   We ordered Wings  Sliders  Mac and Cheese and Onion Rings  Considering how busy they were  there food came out pretty fast and it was delicious ,5,2016-01-15
There s a lot of great food in Las Vegas  but somehow we keep coming back to this place   It s real dependable   The food tastes good   Really good   You can t go away hungry   The outdoor seating is a real plus   When you are more or less on the Strip  it s hard to dine outside in a sane but interesting place   Watching the traffic between Aria and Crystals is far superior than sitting  or trying to sit  on the Strip itself   Finally  although nothing is cheap eating wise in Las Vegas  if you don t over order here  hard not to do sometimes  because there is a good  interesting menu   it s actually perfectly affordable ,5,2014-06-06
ok  as far as pubs go  this is a great place to have a beer or two  i recommend  you try to  down a beer in seven seconds  with a standing egg timer attached to the bar  and get a freebie  free is good  yes    however  if you are a paying customer  purchasing food  you will be greatly disappointed  we were a party of five and not one of our group could eat their meal  i had  actually i didn t  the shepard s pie  which any respectable shepard wouldn t eat  the plate was an oil covered mess and was in eatable  the same goes for the fish and chips  the stale pretzels and everything else presented here  and good luck finding your waitress to complain  i think they retreat into a bomb shelter in preparation for the numerous complaints this place has to be receiving    this place should be renamed todd english s  greasy spoon ,1,2014-10-25
Just like any pub  it s loud  the best food is fried  and the alcohol is plentiful    We visited this pub twice on our visit  The fish n  chips was very tasty  Everything we ordered was pretty good  It s worth a visit if you are looking for pub food in a pub atmosphere ,4,2014-05-26
Greeters do not really seem to care whether you came in or not  maybe they like to screen out their clientele  Servers are okay but maybe they should care more about serving and the food they serve  Good location at least ,2,2016-01-30
THE GOOD  I really like the menu here  Lots of interesting twists on classics  One of my favorites was the pastrami sliders  They were super tasty with nice lean meat and soft bun and it comes with a healthy size of fries    all for only      The service could not have been better  Our waiter was super informative  attentive and friendly  The vibe inside is energetic without being overly loud or gimicky  The abundance of booths is a big plus also  The beer selection is outstanding   THE BAD   While I understand the prices in Vegas  and places like this  are a bit high    I found the food prices to be a real value  BUT the beer prices are too high       for a pint is a bit too much  If the prices were in the      range  we would have ordered a second round  Also  the fish   chips was just OK     BOTTOM LINE  In an area of the Vegas Strip  CityCenter  that has uber high priced everything  you can escape all that at P U B  You ll be treated to every interesting and delicious food along with a pint of beer for a decent price ,4,2010-07-08
Very disappointing  Only thing that saves this place is the service  Overpriced food that isn t really that good,2,2013-02-23
Its time in this amazing place  their beer selection is great  the food is tasty and the bar staff is super friendly  you have to seat at the bar if you want the best service ,5,2017-02-10
I am not a big fan of all of the restaurants on the strip with famous chefs names on them   But this place looked interesting on the outside and i was craving a burger so i decided to stop in   A buddy and i sat at the bar and decided to order a few burgers   Our bartender was awesome and accommodating   I am a huge fan of pickled foods so i ordered the new Amsterdam   Burger  Swiss  sauerkraut  and pastrami  All of my favorite things   But i could not taste any of them cause of the damn brioche bun that is all the new rave these days   It just mutes all of those amazing pickled flavors i should have been tasting   The burger is too big to fit in any normal persons mouth   When i go to eat a burger i want to taste ground beef that is seasoned perfectly throughout and whatever else i choose to top it with   All i got was brioche bun which is so filling and taste muting   I had a few fries but i was stuffed by the burger   It is a fun restaurant i will give it that  everyone was having a great time i just want to know what happened to the sweet tasting soft buns that let one taste the burger ,3,2013-01-03
Just left here  Always a nice time here  Our bartender Aggie made it that much better  She s so nice and helpful  This is the type of service one expects when they come to Vegas but not always gets  There was a big group of rude men next to us  being rude to her  and she handled it like a champ  I would ve lost a screw over that type of treatment  If you re heading to Todd s English Pub in the future       Definitely ask for Aggie ,5,2017-01-29
Wow  this was a great find  My friend and I stopped in for lunch  we started off with mimosas  Yum  She ordered the grilled cheese  comes as a panini with cheese and bacon  great  I ordered the bologna sandwich  oh my  big toasted white bread  thin fried bologna  cheese  I added mustard and enjoyed this wonderful sandwich  Loved the presentation  comes wrapped inside a brown bag with kettle chips and a chocolate chip cookie  So many great things on the menu  gotta get back to try more  This is going to be one of my favorite places to eat ,5,2013-12-08
This is one of the only affordably priced options in the Monte Carlo Aria Vdara Bellagio area  The service is very pleasant and the beer selection is great  but the food is barely acceptable  Between us we had the tuna poke  ploughman s platter  slider burgers  and chicken pot pie   The tuna was stringy and far below what you d call sushi quality   The ploughman s platter featured supermarket salami and cubed cheese off a hotel banquet cheese platter   The sliders were ordered medium  they may have been medium once on their way to being hockey pucks  the chicken pot pie featured microscopic bits of chicken with cubes of undercooked potatoes and a shower of Birdseye frozen mixed vegetables which seemed to have been heated only by the gloppy  tasteless sauce   Oh  and the loud heavy metal music didn t help matters ,2,2015-12-22
A     yard of a great beer and excellent lobster sliders   what else do you need   Next time  I ll pass on the homemade potato chips as they weren t very crisp   The fries one of my friends had were far better   All in all  great place to grab a drink and relax with what little money is left after making a donation in the casino ,4,2013-10-05
Came here for a quick drink and an appetizer before going to Gordon Ramsay s Pub   Grill   Almost wished we didn t make a reservation when we had their truffle fries and sliders   And to beat all     Tabitha was I think probably one of the best waitresses in Las Vegas   Make sure to come and see her and have a drink ,5,2017-10-12
Price has gone up up up    And a lack of kids menus or pricing makes this a non kid friendly place  The food is ok    Some gotchas on the menu make a thorough Q A with your server required   All in all I m unimpressed  It s a really great beer selection  but unless you re there during happy hour  every beer is     for a basic pint  Fine if you just hit a jackpot  but it s definitely geared to catch the tourist s dollars  Not locals friendly at all   Also  being forced to tip the bathroom attendant sucked   Can t say I ll be going back ,3,2014-11-30
I m always suspect about branding around celebrities and food  That goes for ingredients  to cookware  to restaurants  If the name wasn t there  would it be just as good  Well  the Todd English P U B   even the name irks me  Would it be so bad to just say  pub    seems to stand up as a respectable establishment hype aside   The service was noticeable immediately when we entered as personable and helpful  We got seats on a Saturday night with very little wait  The place is spacious and bustling  Restaurants in Vegas don t have the selection of beer I come to expect in my home town  but here  the selection is respectable  Lots of things on tap  both imports  Belgian  German  English  etc   and American microbrews  and they even have a cask ale  which is hard to find      Here s a summary of what we tried    Raw oysters   fresh and delicious  just like in California   Dirty Chips   GET THIS  Unsure what sick mind came up with it  but it was delicious as an appetizer   Duck Confit from the carvery   Delicious  The maple soy sounded a bit suspect  but the savory sweetness worked well with the duck  Use sparingly though  it s a bit concentrated  All you need is a dab  The other sauce that we ordered was the black truffle mayo  As other reviewers rave  it is awesome  Try dipping fries in it   Sheperds Pie   meat and potatoes in a cast iron dish  how can you go wrong  Delicious   The portions are plenty large  so bring an appetite  The prices are what you d expect from a restaurant on the strip  but relatively speaking  it was worth the price   tip  the drinks are what seem to be over priced  don t come here to get liquored up for cheap  Will definitely go back when I m visiting again ,4,2010-07-12
Completely blown away by scrumptious food and impeccable service     If you haven t been to this enjoyable little spot right outside of Crystals you must try it    We were greeted by a host and a manager before grabbing a seat at the bar  A bartender came right over offering us menus  ice water and information about their expansive beer list   Their decor is old school English pub with great lighting fixtures  funky pieces of art decor and an old school feel by allowing you to drop your peanut shells on the floor    Another bartender checked on us a few minutes later to put in our order  We took all his suggestions and I m so glad we did     We ordered the house made Bologna sandwich  the lobster rolls and the fried pickles  I also ordered a Bloody Mary and my partner got a Delirium Tremens and also took the   second beer challenge    The Bologna sandwich was one of the BEST things I ve ever eaten  Who knew something so nostalgic could be so delectable  This sandwich is filled with gooey mozzarella cheese  a tangy mustard sauce  layers of thinly sliced smokey salty house made Bologna and served on perfect toasted Texas toast  Yum   It s served in a bag and comes with house made potato chips and a chocolate chip cookie  Just like mom used to make you for school    But      better  Order this sandwich and enjoy every single bite because you ll be sad when lunch comes to an end   The lobster rolls couldn t look or taste any better  I ve never had such large pieces of lobster served in my roll before  Smaller versions of their adult counter part these little gems are full of sweet lobster tossed in brown butter with a warm aioli and served on a buttered roll along side house made coleslaw and chips  Perfection    The fried pickles were my least favorite only because I m so used to the usual dill pickle chip  These were more of a butter pickle and sweeter than my liking  The sauces were enticing  three of them including a bbq  spicy ranch and my personal favorite the blue cheese fondue  If you like your fried pickles a little on the sweet side these would be a good choice    Our bartenders were so helpful  wonderful servers  They were friendly and their recommendations were spot on  These reasons made our meal  and first time experience at Todds English P U B much more enjoyable  We will return ,5,2015-09-22
Bottom line   Pretty Darn Good   Went with my    yo daughter so wasn t in a beer drinking mood  though if you were  the selection is phenomonal  Had the shepard s pie and it was the best I have ever had in this country or otherwise  Nice and hot and very well seasoned   Service was great and very attentive  proactive   Place was crowded but we only waited   minutes  Front desk crew could use a bit of an attitude adjustment  the only reason they didn t get   stars   We will for sure be back ,4,2010-11-30
Ordered the brown butter lobster rolls  I was very excited for them  but was a bit disappointed  They seemed to be really buttery   and yes  I realize  butter  is part of the dish s name  It was just a little too much butter for my taste   The atmosphere  Everyone seems happy  It s extremely loud  so probably not a good place for a meeting and more of a place to have fun and drink lots of beer  There s TVs everywhere   good place to watch a game   Staff  Nothing special  no complaints there   Seating  A little tight  Kind of crammed in there  I guess that depends on where you end up sitting   Overall  okay place to try out ,4,2017-03-24
Favorite bar on the strip  Good food  lobster rolls  fried pickles  burgers  and GREAT bartenders  Anthony is the man behind the bar  Laid back environment is what I like best  Not an uppity bar like others on the strip  Like I said  It s hidden but the best around ,5,2015-01-16
MARK at the bar made our visit phenomenal  This was our second visit to Todd English Pub  We love the people  food and ambience  The oysters are delicious  taste super fresh  and the signature horseradish is sooo good  We love this place and it will definitely be a must for every trip  Viva Las Vegas  ,5,2017-01-24
Get stuffed   Literally   Not health food   Large portions deep fried or with fat and juices from properly roasted joins  added calories from cheeses and spreads  this is Vegas   Straight forward British pub grub paired with very well chosen selections of beers on tap   The carvery is the focus   Select half or a full pound of the protein  bread and two sauces   Simples   Do select heartier breads  sandwich breads turn to mush    Stick to simple sauces  black truffle mayo or horseradish scour cream  if you want to accentuate the roasted flavors of the proteins   Proteins themselves are perfectly cooked remembering that this is NOT a Jewish deli   Outstanding  brisket   Dripping with juices  deep flavor  just the right amount of fat   The lamb  cooked mid rare has a mild lamb flavor   Finally  the duck confit with its good thyme scented backbone   Moist and crisp when heated   All good eats   All sandwiches are accompanies by a crock of pickled root veg   The very strong acidic finish is required to cut through the fatty goodness of the sandwiches   Great starters include a simple white wine steamed clams with apple wood smoked bacon   The fat from the bacon imparts a great richness and flavor to the clams   The steamed PEI mussels are also very well done   Tender  just cooked through with a great spicy tomato broth   The accompanying garlic aioli and crispy fried cherry peppers adds the right amount of complexity and heat to keep the palate alive   Standard pub fare  fish and chips  very good with perfectly cooked  heavily battered  crisp on the outside and moist on the inside  with a nice side of fluffy chips and mushy peas and the grilled banger and mash with its deeply caramelized onion gravy  are great   Excellent service bordering on off Strip Vegas local  real people living real lives    Great energy and pub ambiance   Crack the peanuts and throw the shells on the ground  bar games for free beers if you can finish in a crazy short time  games on nice and loud and the energy of the guest   Note   Outstanding happy hour and reverse happy hour with half off all beers and wine     Many  many repeat visits   Always consistent   Cheeers ,4,2014-12-24
I recommend valeting your car if you want to go here  It can be a bit confusing to get to from the parking garage  Ask someone to direct you because it is located at the very corner in front of the valet entrance    When you first walk in  you can feel it is a pub  There is a big bar with lots of beers on tap  TV s showing the game and people having a great time  We sat at one of the high tops and enjoyed ourselves  The hostess was very sweet with a warm smile  Our service welcomed us and brought us our drinks  I got a merlot and my boyfriend drank water  They give you a bucket of popcorn  which is so good    I must warn you  DO NOT EAT ALL THE POPCORN  You will get full  Although it is a light snack  you become susceptible to mindless eating  I would save your stomach for the other dishes   We ordered two dishes  the foot long Artisinal chili hot dog with a side of fries and the Lobster rolls  The hot dog was decent  The size is huge  I would recommend sharing it if you can  It was hard to eat since it was so big  The fries are thin crunchy fries  Their ranch their is quality buttery ranch so I would order a side of that    Now the lobster rolls  That is what made the experience so great  If I had to rate the lobster rolls by themselves I would give it a    The lobster was tender  The sauce was delicious  The buttered toast was the right amount of crunch  The cole slaw on the side is the best I ever had in Las Vegas  The chips were chips  There was nothing special with it  It comes with three rolls that are pretty filling    The place is decently priced  The ambiance is great  I would recommend getting reservations if you can especially on the weekends or on game nights  The attire is pretty casual  The servers are great and the place looks clean  It is a true pub  I also suggest walking around the Aria after you are done eating  It is a great way to let your food settle and see beautiful art    I would go back       times just to eat those Lobster Rolls  Overall experience is a   ,4,2015-10-30
Awesome place  This is the best selection for good beer I have found in Vegas  My wife and I stopped here for happy hour and had    IPA s and I had    wings  The wings were sizable and filling  I had    My wife went with an order of muscles which were very delicious as well  I did half of her order   We ate outside and while it is off the beaten path  it is a nice quiet atmosphere  We are actually headed back for their    beer of the day again today ,5,2013-12-20
This is a great Pub located inside the Aria in Las Vegas Blvd   they have a huge menu for drinks and food options   The service is top notch and the prices are very reasonable    The Happy Hour is very good and well priced       for a pint of Bud Light is good for the clients of this place     I love the food and drinks and our server Laurel was great   ,5,2017-11-10
Definitely an interesting megaresort type of take on an English pub    It s a bit too huge to feel pubby  but it has a fairly exhaustive beer list and a lot of delicious food to pick from  Started out with some east coast oysters and had bangers and mash for an entree  Oh how I m a sucker for bangers and mash  and these ones didn t disappoint      stars because although this is a solid place  nothing particularly stood out enough to make me want to go out of my way to eat here again ,3,2014-09-12
This place is amazing  Came for a quick dinner with my husband because I see it s constantly busy  The service was ok but the food was definitely amazing  The atmosphere is super cool  They play good music and I also love the way the food is served  My husband got the foot long hotdog  I got the chicken parm sliders and we got the mini corn dogs for an appetizer  I will definitely be coming here again ,5,2015-04-03
I m a vegas regular and decided to try something new this latest vacation  I m obsessed with Olives by Todd English so I thought I would try out P U B    It was solid and I ll be back    The server was great  very helpful  honest  and friendly   The food was good too  I had the lamb with challah which I loved  especially when I added the truffle may and the horseradish  The only critique is that I would have liked lettuce onion and tomato to add to my sandwich    The best part of P U B  was the   second drink special  Finish a beer in under   seconds and it s free  It can only be done at the bar but even if you re sitting in the dining room they will let you walk over to the bar and take a shot  Good times ,4,2010-06-16
After seeing pictures of the bloody mary  meal  online we made it our goal to visit this establishment   It is difficult to find if you are coming from the strip   We searched for    minutes   For those of you looking  the restaurant is right outside Aria going into the city center     My group was participating in an event all day which prevented us from making the trip to the PUB in the morning   Our goal was the bloody mary and when we arrived there around    pm at night   extremely hungry   we were told that the bloody mary s were for brunch only   I pleaded with them and they kindly made us a round   They were amazing and we loved them     The rest of the food was good  our waitress was pleasant   The restaurant had a great atmosphere   Here is a tip   bring a dollar to the bathroom as there is a bathroom attendant who is quick to squirt soap on your hands when you leave the water closet   She deserves a tip just for sitting next to the bathroom at the back of the restaurant let alone giving you good smelling soap and a towel   We will most certainly return to this restaurant now that we know where it is ,4,2014-05-12
If you re a bodybuilder  like me  you know it s difficult to find good protein rich healthy food on the strip  if there s only one or two of you  avoid the lines and sit at the bar  The bartenders are friendly and attentive  and you can laugh at the crazy tourists slamming beers for under   seconds   Joey in particular rocks     or    ounce portions of slow roasted protein  several options   I usually get a heaping pound of turkey breast   The protein arrives with your carb option  several different types of bread   The protein itself is unadulterated  You can order up to two  dipping sauces   I chose the stout gravy   You can get fries for a side  but I opted for the vegetables  which included pickled cauliflower and pickled peppers   I happen to love pickled anything  but to each his own    Beer selection is the best I ve seen on the strip  even have Founders from my home state of Michigan  I live in Seattle now   Also had the Dragonsmilk stout on tap feom Holland  MI   Like everywhere else on the strip  the place is a bit pricey  The good beers run about     a pint   My turkey meal  however  ran      which is decent given the quality and location   But  hey  you re in Vegas  Expect to spend some   ,5,2016-08-06
I would ve given this place   stars but minus one for hygiene  The quarter plates we got were really dirty  food stuck on both sides  which seemed like they weren t washed at all  The server replaced them promptly but seemed quite unapologetic about it      The sliders were average but their chicken wings were fantastic  Its right next to the aria  so a good getaway from the hotels restaurants ,3,2017-07-01
I had booked an event at Todd English P U B  for a private event   It was the second year we had reserved the space  We will not be back for this purpose   The Good  The food was quite tasty  well prepared  and the commentary from our guests was that they enjoyed everything  The servers that worked with us for the night were on top of things and we appreciated their attention to detail  for example  running around for  last call  orders     The Bad  We were booked in an area that was lined with booths  We booked for     and she put out    chairs  Apparently  the booths were not attributed to our group  Why  I can t say  This was  after all  a private party    When the food came out  our people took up two out of four booths to eat and this was not well received  In fact  the Coordinator asked them to move  To stand and eat elsewhere  while she had some people bring out extra chairs  We were paying about     head  so I think it s fair to say that having our people sit in those booths was not causing them any lost revenue  But she was adamant that  this was not part of our package   When we did move  the tables weren t even filled up  They sat there  Empty  The Coordinator claimed our people were rude to her  but I know the people in question and suspect they were communicating that moving was silly  given the circumstances  The level of customer service from this particular person was pretty laughable ,3,2016-02-09
Worst Happy Hour Menu now that they got rid of the HH Oyster  I only came in to wait with my my child and grab something light to eat while my friends were still gambling and we ve checked out of the room yet    mins we only got waters n no one came to take our order and it was dead   barely   booth were fill in our sections and the immature waiters and waitress were too busy chatting away about their NYE rendezvous  Definitely will never come back or have any of my friends come back   We are often guests at Aria and sometimes go off to eat outside of the hotel and I used to like their HH oyster but this was a disappointment ,1,2018-01-02
Perfect pub style food and extensive craft beer selection combined with warm  modern decor and excellent service  Best beer selection I ve seen in Vegas so far   The menu consists of a lot of English pub fare comfort foods like fish   chips  shepards pie  chicken pot pie  and a carving station  The beer selection alone is worth the visit    We started with the fried pickle chips and they were addictive  Came with   sauces  bleu cheese  thousand island and BBQ  The chips were crispy with a light batter  Awesome start   I then had the grilled Brie  bacon and tomato sandwich  It was done panini style and crisped to perfection  The thick slices of tomato and thick cut applewood smoked bacon paired perfectly with the creamy gooey Brie    Our server was awesome  friendly and checked on us frequently without being bothersome    Will definitely be back next time I m in town  ,5,2014-05-07
I gave it a   stars but this isn t meant to be a bad rating but it was just average  You re in Vegas  you expect it to be   and   star ratings  I ordered the burger and it was average to slightly above average  The service was not that good on the night I was there  I got my food on time but had to practically beg for refills  ketchup and then the check  Maybe is was just a super busy night  I would go back  I didn t order them but the oysters at the raw bar looked good   Update  as I was writing  the waitress came to apologize for my patience and said the computer had gone down  I never mentioned the slowness so give her credit ,3,2016-11-03
Good food and good service  The atmosphere isn t too loud  and there is a lot to look at inside  I got the CBLT and my fianc  got a bacon cheeseburger  They give you a ton of French fries  the skinnies are better then the fatties   We will be back next time we visit the strip,4,2017-02-22
Not my first time here  just forgot to review   This time around  just came in for the Bloody Mary  Never disappoints  Literally a drink and a meal  I drank the drink  but me and   girlfriends had the toppings for dinner      wings  a slider  pickled asparagus  carrots green beans  cheese  wax peppers  a mini corn dog   damn  did I cover it  Soooo good  I always drop by when I m in town ,5,2017-05-16
Excellent variety of ciders with an awesome happy hour   Well  awesome because it brought the drinks down to a reasonable price  The happy hour food specials were pretty tasty too   If you order the pretzels make sure you have someone to share them with   The staff were all very fun and chatty   I ll def hit this happy hour up next time I m in town ,4,2012-11-30
NOT IMPRESSED  Talk about one of the biggest rip offs on the Strip  I am a local and while I know Strip restaurants and bars tend to be overpriced because of the location  THIS place was ridiculously overpriced  Just because you are in the overbuilt City Center development doesn t mean you should take complete advantage of your customers    Although it only took maybe   or    minutes for us to get seated  that was really the only good thing we experienced  We had a group of   seated at a long bar table  and our server was a real jerk  We let him know  BEFORE  we ordered that we preferred separate checks  and he said he would put the order in now and deal with separate checks later  But then we get the check and it has a     gratuity automatically added  and no separate checks  We reminded him we asked for it prior to ordering  and he got a major attitude and took    minutes to get us our bills  And then he messed up my bill ran my credit card on someone else s bill  and had to re run my credit card  So the server says  making sure I could hear him   that s what happens when you split the check   Real professional  I didn t complain about him having to run the card again  but then I get attitude  I understand it can be a  pain to split checks like that  but what ever happened to the customer comes first  If he didn t want to split the check then he should have stated it when we mentioned it the first time and we would have gladly taken our business elsewhere    The menu prices are outrageous  and the food is not even average  I ordered a tomato and onion salad  with shrimp        apiece    It was literally a plate of not very ripe slided tomatoes and red onion slices  drizzled with some viniagrette and a lot of salt  and one jumbo shrimp  I also ordered a glass of Cupcake cabernet sauvignon  and my bill was      Ridiculous  My friends and I won t be coming back ,2,2011-03-25
I ve been back twice  I have accepted that the service is slow  but the food keeps getting better  And I haven t seen a single chef eat from the pass  I am addicted to the Hot Wings  But order the dressing on the side  it s too hard to dip when spread out on a hot plate ,4,2011-10-03
Three words   Black truffle mayo    Omg   Love love love   The prime rib sandwich was amazing        Biggest serving of sliced prime rib  your choice of bread  and two sauces   Definitely get the black truffle mayo    The fondue was good too   A friend of mine also highly recommends the horseradish    I m usually not big on sandwiches at dinnertime  but I definitely would order that again    For appetizers  we did the oast duck buns     Awesome    And this chick is not a beer drinker but I had to do the fruit and chocolate beer sampler   Yup     Beer that tasted like fruit and chocolate   Uh  the chocolate  not so good   But the raspberry and peach beer     Tasted like juice    Fun atmosphere  good food  good service  ,4,2011-09-03
ordered   the     pound corned beef with challah  bread and  truffle mayo and sour cream horseradish sauce     and the braised clams   Verdict  both were delicious  and if you like truffle flavor then definitely try the mayo  i think i couldve eaten it with a spoon P S  i did   the clams looked scary at first cause they were big and usually that means they ll feel like rubber in your mouth but these were perfect  little juicy lumps of joy with bacon flavored white wine sauce    i need to try more options then  see if P U B deserves the final star   but so far i loved my first experience ,4,2010-12-17
I came over from another hotel while visiting Las Vegas for GlobalShop  an annual expo for store hotel restaurant designers  so I was enjoying walking through Aria and the Crystals shops  I then needed to grab a quick dinner before heading back to expo activities  so I thought I d try out Todd s place since I was one of his first ever clients who would rush from work to stand in line in Charlestown awaiting for the door to open at his first Olive s restaurant  Well      I arrived alone to dine  was taken to a table quickly outside and after a previous night s party with open bar  didn t think I was up to having anything but water  I think the fact that I was alone and wasn t going to be running up a big bar bill was a bummer for the server  She pretty much started ignoring me  Like   right past me to take an order of a full   top  Even the couple at the next table looked at me and remarked how she was not serving me  I was getting late and it was actually embarrassing  So  I got up and went inside and spoke to the manager about it   He was very good about quickly reseating me  although then I had attitude from another server in there about taking that table l Lots of server attitudes there     But  the manager took my order quickly  brought it out himself  then comped it all   This is how a restaurant should handle mishaps  if they do occur   But  why oh why did it have to even happen   Geez  snooty server  not everyone has a full group with them and not everyone drinks expensive drinks  so sorry   But  I DO tip extremely well when it s deserved   So    the food  be hungry  Big servings  I had the wedge salad  which was really good  It was so big though  that I was too full to eat much of my entree  It is really big enough to be a main course  unless you are a big dude with a huge appetite  I also had the tuna burger  It was very good  but I only ate half of it   Overall  It was a fun place and I would go back  The outside area  where I actually wanted to sit  is really nice  Inside  a fun louder area  Thank you to the manager for his handling of this unfortunate occurrence  I hope that server finds another job because she doesn t seem to embody the values that Todd has set out from the beginning of his restaurants ,4,2014-03-25
This spot is hidden but such a awesome PUB  The Bloody Mary is HUGE and awesome for a hangover  Make sure you find it near Aria ,5,2019-06-11
The lobster roll is as advertised  Amazing  Food is great and the service is quick  Easy to see why this is a Vegas must   Super convenient when staying at the Aria  walked right in  Don t miss it ,5,2016-07-28
It was terrible  not sure what else to say    other than overpriced  Had the hot dog  bun was dry and the dog was luke warm  not good  My friend had the Cobb salad salad with lobster  just ok  Whole experience was very disappointing  This was actually my second time there  not good the first time either   would never go back ,1,2016-11-14
Had an amazing lunch yesterday  Great food an even better service  Cameron was an amazing server  We are back again today and plan to come again before our vacation is over  Everything on the menu is delicious  Seriously haven t tried one thing I didn t enjoy  I really wish we had a Todd English in South Carolina  ,5,2014-12-03
This is ONLY a review of the midweek bloody  the  All About Mary  in particular  First off  let s acknowledge the enormity of this thing  Major props for the sheer size  Topped with    sandwich slices of salami  cheese cube    stalks of celery    hot wings    drummy    wing   a jumbo shrimp  notably large and incredibly well cooked  mini corn dog  beef slider w  cheddar and bacon  bit dry  and a lemon   lime wedge  not wimpy slices   Now time to list the pickled items  carrot stick  asparagus    green beans  peperoncino  and a pickle  There was a seasoned rim that I think may have been old bay and black pepper but it didn t hold a lot of flavor for me  I m hoping I didn t leave any accoutrement out  Refer to photo for fact checking   Now about the actual Bloody Mary itself  I found the drink lacking a particular briteness or needing a hint of citrus maybe  I would have been much less impressed had it not come with a platter of food   I can t recommend this drink on the mix alone  It s really about the bragging rights and photo cred  Having said this  the bartenders were friendly  accommodating  even agreeing to take my picture  and the atmosphere was upscale casual  I studied the menu believing I was going to have the room to order a lunch item  likely would have chosen the lobster rolls  which I saw get served to a man sitting next to me YUM   then hoping for  at the very least  some room for the chowder  However  all of these dreams were laid to rest in just about   mins into my time spent with Mary  Instead  like a true Wisconsite  I ordered a beer and wrestled through the rest of what lay on my plate  and then just paid my bill  I paid for that     bloody mary I d set out to conquer and I made peace with that  Fun field trip ,4,2017-04-26
Great beer selection but they will set you back a few pretty pennies  Lobster roll was creamy and super filling  Fish and chips had huge pieces of fish  Tucked into the corner so keep your eyes open ,5,2016-01-20
Speaking as a former San Francisco Chronicle Examiner Newspaper columnist  I recently lunched at Todd s and highly recommend it   My food was served at the proper temperature   delicious hot Sweet Potato Fries with a unique apple rosemary dip  and tasty Chicken Wings with blue cheese sauce and celery  and a well mixed Margarita  My server Lauren was attentive to all of my requests  And I LOVED the outdoor patio  Cheers ,4,2011-03-03
Our grand plan was to drive to Vegas and make a beeline to PUB  conveniently located next to our hotel  the Aria   Alas  our efforts were thwarted  Why  you ask  Because apparently they close the kitchen whenever they darn well please   It s based on volume   Uh  okay   We forgave them this shortcoming and came back the next day during happy hour            and       to whenever they decide to close the kitchen  every day      off pints     wings     oysters and sliders    If you re looking for something light and healthful  head somewhere else  If you re interested in a whole pile of greasy deliciousness  you re in the right spot   The junk fries  comes as junk chips  but you can sub in any of the fries  skinnies  fatties  waffle  or sweet potato  we went with fatties  are drenched in blue cheese  savory beef ragu  and tomatoes  and drizzled with aioli and scallions  Yum   The toasted soft pretzels are served piping hot  with a side of cheese  They re good stuff  too   The clear winner was the lobster roll  It s actually three small lobster rolls  which is perfect  because three rolls means more bread  which means more of the brown buttery toasted deliciousness that s happening on the edges  Oh my word  So much butter  and so much delicious  They re served with coleslaw and either chips or fries ,4,2015-08-05
extensive alcohol menu with growlers  BOGO beers  and cheap prosecco   had the foot long hot dog  and lobster rolls  both with skinny fries  the fried were amazing as i was told before coming here and the hot dog was huge  delicious  and i was unable to finish it  the lobster rolls  per my colleague  were in her words  bitchin   it s a lot of food for the price and and can t wait to come back and try more ,5,2017-01-09
Pretty as a picture and delicious to eat were all the items we ordered for the first time today  My lobster rolls   were cooked to perfection and perfectly seasoned  My husband ordered Tuna Tartar as well as a duck appetizer  Both were beautifully presented  The service was exceptional  This was my birthday and our first visit  The waiter surprised me with an ice cream cookie dessert with a candle in it  This was  The Icing On The Cake  that topped off a very pleasant and worthwhile experience  We are sure to return when we visit Vegas again ,5,2014-06-16
After wandering around on the Strip  we needed to get something to eat before we passed out  This was a good spot to settle down and have a brew at the bar    When we sat down  the first thing the tender said to us was if you can chug your first glass it will be free  Of course we thought he was joking until he came back  MY buddy took him up on the offer and chugged down an Apricot ale  which is delicious   To our surprise this is a normal thing and they even have time glasses at the bar    We only ordered apps  I seem to remember the pretzels being okay  Otherwise I thought this place was good and the bathrooms were nice and clean  That is always a plus ,3,2011-07-18
If you re looking for a casual but still delicious place to eat before a night out  or a night in  but since we re talking about Vegas a night in just doesn t make sense   then TE PUB is the place  Went here with some co workers and we sat at the bar  The bartenders were friendly and helpful with the menu since we were from out of town  She suggested Lobster Rolls so we went with Lobster Rolls  She hit the nail on the head  Lobster Rolls were freaking fantastic  So incredibly good and a good deal for the price tag too  As far as beer goes   they have everything  I had a free beer from checking in on Yelp which the bartender seemed a little peeved about  psh  is all I have to say   but the experience was still worth going back for  Again   get the Lobster Rolls  You won t regret it ,4,2014-03-17
Wife and I wanted something we could take back to our room for dinner  Decided on TE Pub since it was at the base of Aria and we were feeling something simple  I ordered the chicken parm sliders and skinny fries  she got the chicken tacos and rice   I received   sliders and a very small salad  wish it was a bit larger portion as the sliders lacked any greens on them  still tasty though  Their fries were also very good  light crisp on the outside  Wife enjoyed her tacos and the rice that came on the side was a very generous portion    The bill ran us about     with no drinks  so a bit on the high side  but the quality and portioning were quite good ,4,2011-11-14
Cool looking place but the food was not up to par   I would definitely come here just for drinks  they have an extensive beer and drink menu and the bar area is quite spacious   We got the turkey burger  wedge salad and chicken sliders   All three were mediocre at best   I was expecting a lot more flavor and maybe even a twist to add some uniqueness to the dishes   Got neither and could have gotten the same thing at Applebees for a third of the price   There is a section of the restaurant that seats next to open windows which look into the hotel lobby   SIT HERE   This made for fantastic people watching  especially on a crazy Saturday night   Come here for drinks and people watching but not for food ,3,2011-05-06
I come to this place everytime i am on the Strip   They have a deal where if you can drink a pint in   seconds then you get it for free   Best Deal on the strip   if you can do it of course   Good food  and a good place ,5,2012-01-16
I like this place because my girlfriend thinks that the food is good  And it is  The only thing is that it is one of the most expensive places I have ever been too  considering it is a  P U B   I know that it is Vegas and rent is probably high  but the beer prices are crazy     for a Pabst      for an Anchor Steam  There was stuff on the international board that could be purchased at Bevmo for some of the highly inflated prices that Todd is selling them for  Apps were expensive as well  It was strange because I didn t think that the food pricing was that bad considering the area  Maybe they have the menu adjusted for the  after convention  crowd  The servers are very nice  regardless  and they have a pretty good oyster bar going on  Just be prepared to spend some money ,3,2015-12-31
Horrible night at the pub I love   Walked into what I thought was a bad karaoke night turns out it was the paid entertainment   Made me question when will be my next time back    ,1,2015-09-05
My second time here and I was again very impressed     Even though they were out of a few beers   which  let s be honest  is bound to happen  With such an extensive beer menu my bartender Kelly  it s a guy  was great at giving me options to replace my boring choices     Turns out the beers he recommended were waaaaaay better than my safety picks    The fish and chips were excellent  the beers were great  the service was top notch     ,5,2016-09-02
I usually stay at the Aria or Cosmopolitan anyways so this place is very easy to get to when I want beer and beer food  I love the charm of this place and the food is addicting  This is definitely a place worth trying if you re new to Vegas ,4,2012-08-10
The brown butter lobster rolls are literally the best lobster rolls I have ever had in my life  lobster rolls are my favorite food  I get them everywhere  Along with    oysters  who could ask for anything more  The service is phenomenal  The atmosphere is great  Come and eat here  Immediately  A perfect lunch stop  Charlie  Mariel  Crystal are PHENOMAL ,5,2013-01-14
Best pot pie I ve had in my entire life    Seriously no joke  this place is amazing and a great reasonable price ,5,2016-07-23
Came before the end of happy hour  All of their wines were discounted and I was able to find something I liked  We had the lobster roll and prime rib special  Both were good  Diane V  was our waitress and checked back with us several times during our meal ,4,2017-09-30
If you are looking to wait    minutes and not get any food at a restaurant that is pretty much completely empty  this place is for you  Once the food came I would rate the food only as a solid      Had the chicken sandwich ,3,2017-08-06
Food was average  Place was so noisy you couldn t hear your table without a megaphone  Not sure how to describe the ambiance  except to say it is someone s Las Vegas attempt to be urban something  Really  I expected more and got less ,2,2012-01-01
This place was amazing    The best service we have had since arriving in Vegas    The manager even gave us a few tasters of beer to try and engaged in conversation with us  The food is definitely worth it  Try the Tuna Burger or the Fish   Chips   ,5,2015-07-03
An expansive beer list but thats about all it has going for it  The food reads better than it tastes  The  dirty  chips were a must order based on the ingredients  but  it was so huge it got tiring eating it  Was good though  The foot long kobe dog was all bread and it being kobe made no discernable difference in taste  Service seemed peppy at first but quickly deteriorated  maybe we smelled or something ,2,2011-09-25
A fantastic stop in LV  I have never been disappointed by a Todd English restaurant  Great mix of sandwich and international beer menu  Sliders  roast beef and burgers  are both excellent  And the Junk Chips are a real winner  Good service and nice decor makes this a   Star in my book ,4,2013-06-18
I love this place   The service is always friendly and it is a fun and lively spot   We like the Happy Hour offerings   oysters  wings  and sliders   The drink selection is vast and decent   The bread pudding  based on our servers recommendation  was FANTASTIC   Always a great visit ,4,2015-02-01
Went here for the Bloody Mary and it was worth the trip  It is fully loaded and an entire meal in itself  Ordered one up for brunch and it was all that was needed  Other person in my party ordered a regular Bloody Mary and meal  Food was ok  bar was lively  service was nothing spectacular but was fine  Honestly it was all about the Bloody Mary  Would revisit just for that next time we are in town ,4,2016-07-10
Even though there is only one meal entree that is vegetarian  they totally score with it   Sure there are plenty of random sides and alterations to entrees my man and I could have made in order to enjoy vegetarian options but we were still surprised there was only one option  That is until it was in our mouths causing our taste buds to dance a Portobello Mushroom Burger dance of joy and happiness  SO good    I refrained and stayed away from the bucket of fries but from what the man says  they are the best he s ever had  Or one of the best in his top    something like that  The burger comes with a side of pickled vegetables that I seriously couldn t stop eating  We shared the burger on our first visit because we weren t super hungry  The second time we went in while on our Vegas trip we shared the Portobello Mushroom Burger and the Iceberg Wedge Salad  vegetarian version  with a side of vinaigrette dressing    I enjoyed two  yes two  glasses of delicious Blanco Sangria filled with peaches and strawberries  I need another glass now  Check this place out  They have a ton  about     different beers and the atmosphere is fun  Definitely worth a stop while you re in the Vegas ,4,2012-07-06
Food s good  beer s great and we like the atmosphere  Everything I have had here is good  Shepherd s pie  chicken pot pie  fish and chips  etc  But the best thing I have had on the menu is the lobster rolls  I thought they were stellar   We ate here about  x on our last Vegas trip  Def  a thumbs up  ,4,2014-01-07
There are certain beers at the bar  if you drink them in less than   seconds  they are free   Great pub food   Awesome service    I ve been about   times over the years and it never disappoints ,4,2015-02-01
It was really good  right up until  the point I got food poisoning   Had the brown butter lobster roll  had a few drinks at the bar   spent the rest of the night puking my guts out     It was so good going down  absolute hell coming back up   In case you were wondering it was about three draft beers so it was certainly not an over indulgence   Couldn t come back here even if I wanted to ,1,2014-05-07
  cent PBR beers on Tuesdays is what got me here    Let s be honest  why would I samps pub food or beer in City Center  it just screams expen ive   But  the food wasn t too bad on price and it was delishhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh    how do i add more  H s here    My friend and I shared a lamb sandwich on pita with truffle mayo and soy maple sauce    OMFG    SO EFF N GOOD     Come for the  cent beer but  STAY FOR THE INCREDIBLE FOOD                 ,5,2010-06-02
Good bar food   The beer flights were somewhat interesting and overpriced   I d prefer if I could choose the flights rather than having a Pabst blue ribbon     The pastrami sandwich came unassembled  pastrami  bread  mustard  and pickles on separate plates   very tasty   Not all the seats have good views  I was stuck behind a big pillar   Luckily the waitress was friendly enough to switch the only tv I could see over to a NBA game     good food  good beer  good service  and good entertainment is the meaning of life     there was a lady in the washroom who provided nothing but annoyance   I dislike the concept of bathroom attendants with a passion   not once has an attendant provided any service I couldn t get without them ,3,2014-02-20
I came here late after Blue Man Group  Walked around for a bit and this place looked intriguing  I think it was the best food for the price  Didn t go wrong with some sliders  hot wings  oysters  and something else I forgot along with nice and cold beers  I will definitely be back to this place when I am in Vegas again ,4,2013-05-01
Great service and outstanding food  Perfect meal from appetizer to dessert  Fast and prompt service  Thank you Jeff for helping us end our tournament weekend on such a great note ,5,2015-04-06
Amazing    Bar staff was so good and a lot of fun  This place is my favorite bar in Vegas  Come here every time I am in town ,5,2017-01-20
Great custom bloody marys  and the craft beer selection is awesome  Really good place for brunch before the pool or to start your Vegas day off right ,5,2015-06-05
Came here for the All Star baseball game tonight  HH was nice  half off beer and wine until  pm  Avg glass of wine is around    for HH  house     Ordered the tuna burger  which has seared tuna  avocado  black bean pur e and spring mix lettuce on multi grain bun      it s great if you re not on a budget and want something fairly healthy  Also served with wonton chips and a honey mustard sauce  Sliders are    during HH  along with    wings and oysters  Nice bartenders ,4,2016-07-13
I ve taken groups of       customers here from time to time  The menu is nicely proportioned  and the staff is accomodating  They even drew a few tables together for us to play beer pong on ,5,2011-09-18
You wake up the next morning after a long  fuzzy night  You need grease  You need it so badly to soak up the debauchery you put yourself through  You get up and make your way to salvation  but the buffet line is too long  All you want is french toast and a bottle of syrup  Strips of bacon and oil ridden home fries  But you can t  The litter of families in this adult disneyland is what separates you from your happiness   Then you remember there is one spot that can take care of your needs and has a sandwich to save your life  Todd English Pub has an outstanding fried bologna sandwich that is loaded with a hearty stack of meat and melted cheese  Need your fried potato fix  Comes with a bag of house made chips  This meal saved my life  and can save yours too  If you need to keep that drink train going just get their Bloody Mary  you can go as epic as to have a hot wing skewered in it   And   don t forget about the happy hour oysters all day long ,4,2015-03-15
Drink a beer in   seconds and it s free   Sign me up   I thought this place was pretty cool   Our server  Mike  was one of the best waiters I have had   He was friendly  very helpful  and he chatted us up while we were there   The food was pretty tasty   I had the double burger and it was very flavorful  maybe a little too much seasoning   I also tried the Chicken Pot Pie and the Shepard s Pie   Both were delicious   My buddies and I were here on a Tuesday and at   they have   cent PBR s but you have to have a     tab   The place got jam packed for this   The atmosphere was great and we had a great time   A little pricey but they have a good beer selection  beer flights  and Cask Ale ,4,2010-12-30
Horrible Experience  We sat at the bar for dinner  The bartenders were soooo rude and arrogant  We asked if they could change the game on TV  he laughed and made fun of us  Then we were eating their peanuts and the second bartender came up and scolded us for dirtying their counter top  We decided not to tip them and as we were leaving the bartender angrily crumbled up the paper and threw it in the trash  Really  We are local residents and we have choices    On the way out the manager tried to buy our dinner  but that wasn t the point  They ruined our night   ,1,2013-02-18
I really wanted our experience to be amazing  but unfortunately it was just mediocre    We were greeted promptly at the door and sat quickly but we had to wait about       minutes to be greeted at our table  I was so thirsty and even thought about moving to the bar to get quicker service  Eventually our server came by and didn t have much to say  I asked about recommendations    Ordered the duck which he said he hadn t tried or heard much about     Although we started with the clams and Chorizo app and it was phenomenal my duck was over cooked and grits were a gummy paste  I wasn t going to say anything but I think my sever could tell I didn t care for it  So he asked if I wanted something different and I settled for the soup of the day  he explained it to be like a cioppino  was not at all like that  it had deep fried rock hard pieces of fish  Needless to say I didn t care for it either  didn t say anything just didn t eat it  My husbands bangers and mash were spot on though  It was nice that our server was cool in the end and took the soup and duck off the check  I didn t expect that all  So thank you  And I do want to give it another shot for sure  Just maybe go with some of the fan favs ,3,2016-07-07
This place is super cool  The husband and I were in Vegas last week and we were looking for a good Belgian beer on tap  They have an amazing beer list  They have tons of Belgians on tap including the St  Bernardus     If they don t have something you like on tap  they have plenty bottled beers   The bar is pretty chill and the bartender we had was really friendly  They have a great happy hour where beers on tap were half off  including the Belgian beers  We had to go back again the next night to catch happy hour   pm to  pm and   pm to close   We were enjoying    St  Bernardus   s  What      That is a smoking deal   This place is in the shops at Aria and is pretty chill  Can t comment on the food because we only came for drinks  but they had free peanuts to snack on while we drank  Great beer list ,4,2015-08-31
This is a nice place to come for drinks and people watching by the aria hotel  Their oysters are very good  but    an oyster during happy hour isn t much of a happy hour  But c est la vie    It is Vegas  The server was pleasant  Nice place for a close and affordable meal at the aria ,3,2015-03-19
We went late Tuesday night because we had read that they had   cent beer then  They don t offer that anymore  just a heads up so others don t go in expecting this  The food was very good  Service was great as well ,4,2012-02-02
Excellent happy hr specials on wings and sliders  Beer prices were a bit high even though they re half off    Cool ambience and a lot of space  Service was outstanding  Our server Kimberly was knowledgeable about the menu and drinks while making us feel welcome and cared for   She alone made the trip worth it   Definitely a good place to stop in as you walk the strip ,4,2013-02-24
This place just opened a few months ago at Aria in Las Vegas    The selection of different starters and beer was great  I started with an Anchor Steam and Handmade chips with bacon  blue cheese  blue cheese dressing  tomatoes and chicken liver  At first i was a little apprehensive about the chicken liver but when the liver arrived deep fried i was pleasantly surprised  All the flavors paired well together  The nachos were delicious   For the main course I ordered Fish and chips  It arrived as a whole fillet on top of a mound of french fries  It was accompanied with tartar sauce  ketchup  and malt vinegar cream sauce that was to die for  Overall the fish was good but i would get another item next time    The service was a little slow but they were busy with the lunchtime rush    I would definitely go back  The menu had so many great choices that i was sad i couldn t eat more  Gastropub done right ,4,2010-03-15
Cameron was great   Good food   a free beer with a check in   I will definitely eat here on my next trip to Vegas   Perfect food during   after drinking for days ,5,2015-05-26
Great pub next to the Aria Hotel and Casino    Amazing beer and whiskey menu    Excellent pub food    Place to go to chill and drink ,3,2018-03-24
Stopped in here for an early dinner on our way to see Love at the Mirage  It was perfect timing because we got there during Happy Hour and scored     price beers  very  VERY solid beer list   meaning the beers were only slightly more expensive than I d normally pay  instead of WAY overpriced    I had the lobster rolls  my friend had the mussels  I am not a mussel girl  but I sampled the broth  and wow  it was so good   perfectly seasoned  My lobster rolls were divine    just the right amount of mayo and the buns were overflowing with lobster    I dig the vibe of the place  it is a Pub after all  but it just has great ambiance and you don t feel like you re in the middle of all the Vegas craziness  I think the prices are pretty par for the course as far as Vegas goes  and my meal was worth every penny ,4,2012-04-30
Looked up best bloody Mary s in Las Vegas and this place was one of the top choices  So of course we made it out first stop after arriving in Vegas  There are a couple of different ways to order your Bloody Mary  You can order one of their specials or you can build your own  I decided to build my own and it was just how I like it  You get to choose the  type  of alcohol  the type of tomato juice and then you toppings        or   depending on what type of build your own you order   They have a wide variety of toppings  green olives  black olives  stuffed green olives  celery  carrot sticks  peppercinis  green beans  pickles  bacon  shrimp  a slider  etc  their food is also tasty  Since I was having a fully loaded Bloody Mary I decided to just get a bowl of clam chowder  which was very yummy and creamy  Some of my friend got the bangers and mash  the shepherds pie  the fried pickles  etc and they all thought the food was also very tasty  They also have a fun challenge here if you like chugging beer  It s called the   sec challenge  You choose a beer  under     and if you can chug the beer under   sec that beer you drank is free  Some of my friends did this challenge and thought it was great  If you are up to the challenge go see the bartender and they will set u up for the challenge  Good luck and have fun ,4,2015-02-03
Come here for BEER ONLY they had pints for     As far as for the food it seems Todd English got his inspiration from a Friday s franchise and then overprices it just to make it look pretty on a plate  ,2,2012-01-04
We had good service that s where it ended  Food was bland and pretty tasteless  Lobster rolls were more bread than lobster and then had no flavor  Todd s Tacos had no seasoning and a weird sauce that shouldn t be on Mexican food   Would not go back ,1,2013-12-29
This follow up review is from approx   months ago    haven t been back since and don t plan on going although it s   min walk from me   Had a few friends over for Thurs night football   after we wanted to grab some food so we headed downstairs to Todd English Pub  despite my previous review decided to give it another shot and try the food too    I live right above this place  at Veer  but avoid it in general   Shared   items  fish and chips  sliders and one other  can t remember so it couldn t have been too memorable    Fish and Chips were good  but not worth       Everything else was just overpriced bar food   My friends were amazed at the     pint prices  so we decided on a pitcher of Spaten for     to try and get more for our      NOT SURE IF IT S MORE SAD SHOCKING HILARIOUS THAT ONE PITCHER     PINTS HERE     SO THEY CHARGE YOU AN EXTRA    FOR THE PRIVELEDGE OF POURING YOUR BEER  I d love for a manager to contact me and explain this to me   Service was friendly but rushed   what s the point   The place is never full anyway so why rush your customers   They tried to take our food away several times before we were done     Avoid this place   Hit the Burger Bar at Mandalay or sadly even the Pub at Monte Carlo is better   ,1,2012-02-16
Always packed  great beer selection  and the food isn t too bad either  The  nd best beer bar on the strip  Surprisingly they had a few Cask Ales to choose from  which is a rarity within the Las Vegas area    so naturally  with that enhancement  it bumped it up from a   star to a    star     I would very much like to see some more promo s for the locals however   the nickel beer night was a huge hit    but they unfortunately got rid of it    ,4,2013-02-10
This is the best customer service we experienced during our short trip to Vegas  We were mocking every  great  new place as we would experience horrible service at every single one of them  This is the first place that felt like the staff actually cared ,5,2013-05-10
Wide selection of beers and World best Bloody Mary  Their BM is so fancy with wing  mini corn   slider  cheese  olive  salami and celery  Oysters are so fresh  Definitely would come back,5,2013-05-06
Shady rolled intp T E PUB Hans Solo style for a lazy Fri afternoon lunch before heading to MGM for   nights of slumming with the fishes  had to try the chicken parm sliders  and    um um good   Nice scene for lunch  great beer selection  personable bartenders  friendly crowd  adjacent to Aria and not far from Cosmo  plenty of tv s to watch the games outdoor area   whats not to like  Shady   not really a beer type guy  hit the Hank Larsen s early as a prep for the shows that night  Shady makes TE PUB the place to go for a quick at  the  bar type meal ,4,2014-11-07
When we arrived at the the PUB we were surprised how unpub like it was  It did not attempt to have a faux interior that Vegas is famous for  It was very bright and trendy  which are not things I look for in a pub  The  hostesses were very friendly and outgoing and made us feel welcomed  but that was where it ended  Our waitress Krystal K seemed very sarcastic and did not care if we were there or not   Enough about her  our food was good  my friend had the bangers and mash and I had the clam chowder but I don t think a very small laddle of clam chowder is worth    nor a bologne sandwich worth         I do understand that it is Vegas and prices are overinflated  but come on   really Mr  English your prices are way out of line  The small bucket of popcorn was an unexpected surprise   Beer pong balls for sale in a vending machine   nice addition to the atmosphere  I may go back on my next trip  but it is tucked away in a corner and I am not sure if it is worth the walk ,2,2012-03-07
Enjoy free beer and a friendly atmosphere  If so  this is the place to go   Free pint of beer if you finish within   seconds    tries per person each day   Rod  the bartender  was super interesting and cool  We had happy hour wings and sliders  which were only mediocre   Regardless of the food  we returned the next day due to the bartender  great service and of course  free beer  We also discovered the option of self service beer depending where you want to sit  Prices were calculated by the number of pints poured applies to happy hour prices as well   which means no waiting around for your beer  and playing bartender for the night  Awesome and welcoming ambience  will definitely return ,5,2012-04-10
Great food coupled with great draft beer    can you ask for more   St  B s    on tap    are you kidding me    Wonderful service and great atmosphere ,5,2014-04-25
Very nice atmosphere  Plenty of beer selection     Fried Pickles as app along buffalo wings were fantastic  Buffalo wings were unbelievable    huge     messy but awesome  Chili was delicious topped with cheddar   Foot long hot dog was huge and very tasty   Waitress was prompt and courteous   Highly recommended for lunch and a few beers ,5,2016-10-28
Great food   Great bartenders   Great bloody Mary s   If you are staying at the Aria it s a must stop and if not then walk your butt over ,5,2017-03-12
We had lunch here yesterday to meet a friend who is now a local  We sat outside and enjoyed the day  The beer selection is always good  We tried the fried pickles and they were really good  Crispy and lots of dill punch and they serve it with   dipping sauces  The blue cheese fondue is surprising and delicious  I loved the BBQ and the ranch is really good too  We also shared the corn dogs and the truffled parmesan fries  We should have asked first because the corn dogs come on a bed of fries and they are really good small bites  I think my least favorite item was the truffled parmesan fries and they were really good too  just a little too much truffle for my taste  My favorite item here is the lobster rolls  everyone should try them at least once  This is one of our favorite pub s to visit while we are here Thanks for always providing great service to go with the food and beers ,4,2017-10-09
Came here with a big group of    people and   kids  Service was pretty good for a large party   and maybe because we also had a high roller at our table  lol    Anyway  food was okay  Nothing too special  I got the ribeye  which was really plain  but presentation was nice  The best thing on that dish was the potato wedges smashed together covered in spinach  My bf got the chicken  which again was really plain tasteless alone  My dad got the prime roast and again it was flavorless  If you use the sauce it was really salty  there was no perfect balance  My friend got the salmon  which was cooked right  the only thing cooked right and not plain  The skin was nice and crunchy too  I don t think every one really loved their food  It was okay   I think I d prefer a buffet    variety    But this place is good for their selection of beers and drinks  Big place  was able to accommodate us last minute ,3,2011-10-04
Great place to go to for an inexpensive  low key night  My husband and I decided to come here for a late dinner during the   p   a happy hour  and very happy we did  We ordered a dozen chicken wings    sliders  the fried pickles  an oyster  and   pints of beer and got out here for LESS than         you can t go wrong with that    Chicken wings were nice and crispy  but a little on the small side  and I wish they had more sauces  Sliders were awesome  ordered and got a perfect medium mini burger  dressed in thousand island and caramelized onions  YUM  The fried pickles were very good as well  but a HUGE portion  and we just couldn t get through them  The pickles are a mixture  sweet and dill   the fried sweet pickles threw me off a little  but the dill chips were great  My husband tried an oyster for the first time  and the waitress walked him through the whole process and what he should put on it  Needless to say  she made him a fan      This place has a ton of beers  but unfortunately about   of the beers my husband tried to order were not available that night  Service was great though  food came out fast and overall it was nice place to relax  eat and drink ,4,2014-12-16
Great lunch spot  we got a table outside and the people watching was wonderful   My husband s brisket platter was fantastic  my lobster cobb salad was just so so   Good  reasonable wine list   I can t drink beer  I m allergic to yeast     but the beer list is awesome   Good service despite being very busy   Definitely recommend for a casual lunch ,4,2012-10-16
Hubby and I went to Todd English PUB looking for some good food and a break from gaming   We were greeted by the hostess  and chose to sit at the bar   The ambience was chill  just as you would expect from a pub   We were welcomed by the bartender  Cody  who kept us well supplied with drinks and peanuts   Hubby had the lobster rolls  and they were awesome  he shared a bite with me   I had the sliders with bacon and cheese   Very generous portions for both  and the skinny fries were bomb   It was pricey  as others have shared   our lunch with   cocktails came to       However  we liked it so much  we came back the very next day    Next day  hostess was a bit rude  but whatever  we were headed back to the bar   This time we had a super friendly  funny bartender   Chad   Lunch consisted of pork belly sliders  delicious  and the Ruben  which was amazing   Huge chunks of corned beef and cheesy marble rye bread   Too large of a portion  we couldn t finish all of the food   This time I had a Franziskaner Hef beer  which was light and wheat y   Total for lunch and beer        Overall  we had a great visit in Vegas  we will definitely stop back at the PUB when we re back next ,4,2015-09-12
I was trying to go to as many new restaurants and bars as I could during my   day stay in Vegas   This was one of the best   I loved the atmosphere as soon as I walked in  Being by myself  I chose to sit at the bar   For a pub it had a very classy feel to it but not classy enough that discarding your peanut shells onto the floor is frowned upon   Also each bar position has a fancy   second hour glass attached to the bar  If you can finish your beer in   seconds  it is free   The problem with this is they have a very sophisticated selection of beers and it would be a shame to drink one that fast and not enjoy it    Two things caught my attention  The Raw Bar and the Carving Station   Im not a huge raw fish fan but I had a couple of oyster shooters to start off  The selection of raw fish was very good and fresh if you are into that   The carving station had a great selection of meats from chicken  prime rib and duck    The menu was fun and also had beer samplers specific to the stye like a Pilsner or Heifewiezen ,4,2010-12-03
We came here while on a scavenger hunt in Las Vegas  The bartender was super friendly  I really wish I would have gotten his name  He totally took the time to help us find a California based beer that was on draft  I settled on a refreshing cider  and my boyfriend had the recommended beer   While sitting up at the bar you get a full view of the cooks shucking oysters and it is a pretty intense show  I have plenty of experience with those damn things and it still scared me when I see someone else doing it    Friendly staff  definitely worth stopping by ,4,2012-06-03
What a great place   Very relaxed and cool vibe in the City Center  Get the pigs in a blanket  they were awesome ,4,2010-08-25
I came here the weekend of my   st birthday and I honestly don t think I ve ever encountered better service  Our server was sweet and her recommendations on what to order were delicious  We ended up getting the mac and cheese and mini corn dogs for appetizers  The mac and cheese is phenomenal  I split a lobster roll with my friends which was bomb as well  The bartender overheard that it was my birthday and he treated us to a round of shots   And I guess you get a free ice cream sandwich when it s your birthday  yum  Overall it was a great experience and I m definitely coming back to try their happy hour menu and drinks  Couldn t really manage the first time because we were too hungover ,5,2014-03-21
I ve been wanting to try this place since the last time I stayed at the Aria   I loved the ample indoor and outdoor seating   This place is wedged between the aria and the crystals  The inside has an open floor plan and an open kitchen  Tons of tvs to catch the games  I tried the spicy crispy chicken wings  skinny fries  and a side salad with an oregano vinaigrette    The wings were huge in size but delicious and meaty  The Buffalo sauce was creamy and just the right amount of heat   Fries were nice and crispy  It came with an addictive truffle mayo dipping sauce   Our server was awesome   She was very friendly and attentive  Oh by the way  they start you off with a bucket of buttery popcorn which I couldn t stop eating ,4,2016-01-19
When lobster is on the menu  there is no question what I will order   I ve been on a quest to find the best lobster roll outside of New England and I ve found it   Big  juicy chunks of lobster  simply dressed  on a toasted  buttered roll   Yum   I would travel back to Las Vegas just to order this   If my travel partner had allowed  I would have eaten every meal here and ordered the same thing ,5,2012-09-18
Descent microbrew   My sliders were pretty good   She got the chicken pot pie which was soupy and disappointing    I d like to give them a better review but sending out chicken soup with some puff pastry on top shows a lack of quality ,3,2012-11-28
We ordered the recommended porter  beer   some of the    oysters  Reuben sandwiches  toffee pudding and coffee   All really good  surprisingly so for Las Vegas and being right on the strip   Not cheap  but good pricing for that part of Vegas   Waiter was really good   Keep this on your list for a fun night out  good food without the typical Vegas cheesiness or bloated pretension ,4,2016-01-21
The Junk Chips are a MUST order  They are a fantastically  greasy  salty  sweet  bbq y     chips and are so good with beer ,4,2013-08-08
Food excellent  Waiting staff excellent  especially bar area   Manager terrible on this occasion  Watching US Open match on screen in bar area  Fifth and deciding set  Manager changes screens to baseball game no one is interested in  When bar staff relays our dismay   the manager responds by changing screen to an infomercial  Bar staff was apologetic   but too much so  This is the manager s fault   not theirs  The screen was returned to the tennis match after it was over ,1,2015-09-08
Home of the   second beer challenge  I Yelped this place and walked in just wanting to chug some beer  They have sand timers built into the bar which is pretty cool  Four of us did it  we had a choice of bud light  Pabst or some house beer that looked thick and creamy  We all got bud light and the bartender was the judge  he flipped the timer and we were off  The only thing that made this reallllly hard was the fact that it was so cold  The beer and glass were ice cold so it was harder to go down  Two of us were just shy of   seconds so the bartender gave it to us anyways  Yay for free beer  We ordered another round and had our own competition  Pretty fun quick thing to try  I believe the bar is located inside of Aria Hotel ,4,2015-04-14
Should have got the Chicken Parm Sliders like my dude but we try to get different things to taste  They were right on point  I got the   Pork Sliders and it was   block of meat and little cole slaw  It was hard to bite but too small to cut  If it werent for the slaw i would have been miserable  Lobster Rolls were AHH massssing   We came at a great time    right in between happy hours so there was no wait  Half Chicken was mehh ,3,2015-03-31
Great food   I just had their steak tacos and I was not disappointed   The bartenders are awesome too   However   the music sucks  The playlist used to be really good  It was something different in Vegas and that is why I kept coming back  Now it s worse than a karaoke bar  At least karaoke is comical    this is just sad  I could give them a five star rating if the music wasn t so craptastic ,3,2015-05-28
We came here originally for their Happy Hour oysters  Thought it was every day night  but it wasn t  I suggest you call before coming here if you re requesting oysters  We were all disappointed  but they had a great selection of items on their menu and everyone found something they liked  They also have a catchy beer game at the bar which was very enticing  Fun place for drinks and food  It was quiet though for being such a large restaurant  We ll have to come back again to try their HH again soon ,4,2017-04-12
I ordered the Lobster Roll  While the lobster was cooked fine and had this clean simple flavor  the bread roll really disappointed me  I didn t like the bread to lobster ratio  I also didn t like that the bread had no crunch or particularly interesting flavor to it  Perhaps the lobster would have been better off in a toasted garlic roll  I have to day the slaw was nice though ,3,2011-02-19
I like this place it was clean  and had good seating to watch football  drank a lot of beer  the happy hour was ok  I didn t really care for the options offered  oh wait the wings and oysters  strange comb yes  I took full advantage of      all in all nice spot for good food in casual setting and good beer ,4,2014-01-08
As good as it FREAKING GETS          I m not usually a fan of beer  but with there various selection of handcrafted beer  you just can t help but to order one  The    oysters are fresh and absolutely presented on a fancy smancy tray   As our food was being brought to our table  the mouth watering smell of the lobster roll traveled faster than the waiter  at which we all immediately made room and waited anxiously for it to arrive at our table  The grilled cheese with bacon and tomato sandwich made me roll my eyes back continually as juice and oil dripped down my fingers   Lastly   as I ve become allergic to shellfish   yes  I know  very unfortunate  my friend ordered the seafood stew and I watched sadly as the rest of the girls devoured and lick the bowl clean  hence  it must be delicious ,5,2012-08-08
We came to Todd English P U B  for a friends birthday after a night at the Cosmo ice skating rink   I definitely wanted to visit this place  being that Todd English is a   time James Beard award winner   Yum  I heard the place was located in Crystals mall  so what a great opportunity to Yelp and top notch place on the strip   We originally parked at the Cosmo and walked over to Crystals   There s a convenient over pass  but let me tell you  the restaurant is situated in a little nook in the mall  so make sure you keep your eyes open   Once you get in the place  you ll notice the round circular lamp chandeliers   The lighting is a bit dim and offers a romantic intimate setting   One of the immediate focal points is the seafood bar   When I went there  not much of the seafood was displayed  rather a bunch of crushed ice   We were sat in the back where you say a cool exposed brick wall   You got to see the expediter station and where the food was being cooked   I love exposed kitchens   It contributes to the intimate type setting  like you have a personal chef  Our servers name was Corey   He was a cool guy  really nice and accommodating   He checked on our table once in a while and didn t breathe down our neck which was very much appreciated   Some restaurants provide a basket of bread before the meal   This place  oddly enough  gives a small bucket of popcorn   To me  it says cheap   I m not really a fan of that   I d put that in the same boat as giving peanuts   Not something I really expected from a Todd English establishment  but it did the trick   For my drink  I got the Gnarly Head Pinot Grigio for     a glass   Heads up  if you check in to Yelp  you get a free   oz glass of light beer   I got that too    LOL  For dinner  I got the New Amsterdam burger for       This burger is a   oz beef patty  shaved pastrami  kraut  Swiss cheese  picklelilly and fatty fries   I got the patty medium rare which was perfectly cooked  the shaved pastrami was nice and salty   I asked for the kraut on the side  but should had it on the burger like it came   Offered a tangy element and a light crunchy texture to the burger   The fatty fries were little wedges  nothing groundbreaking but they did give a lot   At the end of the day  the place was better than OK  I wouldn t mind going back to try the seafood as it looks like a highlight to the restaurant   Thanks for a great birthday dinner for my friend ,4,2014-01-08
Mediocre food and service  I probably would have given three or four stars  but the coed restroom  complete with pushy attendant  kills the experience for me ,2,2014-05-29
Definitely a fun place to have good food  good beer  and hang out with friends  I love the vibrant loud vibe of this place  My husband and I came here while the Olympics were on  and it was really fun to watch on TV while everyone cheered during the events    I had the Ahi burger  which was left nothing to complain about  and finished with  Stephanie s bread pudding   which had Captain Crunch pieces on top   yum    The beer selection is really good  not as good as other places on the Strip  but also nothing to complain about  I would definitely eat here again and recommend it to anyone wanting a fun  pub atmosphere with better than pub food ,4,2012-08-09
 rd time at Todd English PUB  and  nd time this week   I love the atmosphere and my service has always been top notch   especially tonight  keep reading   Tonight I went with my fianc  and her family   Our servers were very friendly and everybody had a great time   The staff was nice enough to modify some of our meals   like a special salad for my fianc  and off menu greens with my steak   The mussels are so good  especially the sauce   I found myself almost drinking the tomato sauce with a spoon   Others tried the thick slices of pastrami and loved it   The shrimp  sold by the piece  is perfect   My ribeye was a thin cut  pub style   It was tasty although I prefer a good filet over a ribeye any day   Interesting thing happened   My shrimp came and I grabbed the lemon   something thick and black on the lemon made a dark stain on my finger   Smelled like grease or rubber   The staff was quick to apologize and take it back to the manager   I went to the nice bathroom  complete with attendant  and wash my hand   When I came back  they had given me a fresh batch of shrimp and a couple of extras   The manager came by and apologized again and was very nice to everyone   I was impressed because a simple sorry would have been enough for me  but they made sure we were taken care of     Finally  we briefly mentioned that we were getting married in several months   At the end of our meal  out of nowhere  a couple of lit candles and some ice cream cookie sandwiches appeared on our table   Nice touch   The menu has so many different choices  I could come back    times and try something different every time   Some people complain about the prices but  come on  what do you expect from a nice place right next Crystals    a high end shopping mall   I love this place and will return for more ,5,2012-09-18
As someone who lived in the UK for over two years  I have high expectations for  pubs   I went here for two friends on a Friday afternoon  It was fairly crowded  but we were seated right away  We chose to sit indoors due to the lack of cover from the sun outside   I ordered the special   chicken and waffles   Bit off the beaten path for a pub menu with that option  but it was delicious  Just the right amount of spice on the chicken and the waffles tasted like Sunday morning  Service was fairly good  and the prices were average   If I m craving British food  I will most likely head back for a more traditional dish ,4,2015-02-26
Tony our server made some great suggestions   Food was absolutely wonderful   Will make Todd s a regular stop when we travel to LV  ,5,2016-07-02
We have passed by this place multiple times on our trips to Vegas and stopped by on a whim for happy hour   Glad we did       price wines and pints     oysters and    sliders   LOVE the pretzel appetizer   great portion and favor for      Can t wait to regain appetite for dinner   Courtney is an amazing bartender   REALLY appreciated her recommendations and awesome  attentive service              We had the best waiter  Steve   He kept us happy during the entire Seahawks game and had a great sense of humor   Would definitely request him to take care of us again ,5,2014-06-30
I won t complain about how expensive the Todd English PUB is  because it is in the Aria hotel and everything is equally overpriced there   But I will complain about the poor food   For example  the chicken pot pie had a total of four small pieces of chicken in it    but that was actually a blessing  because the chicken tasted like boiled cardboard   The puff pastry on the top was puffy but had no taste of pastry   That might have been a fluke  you say   Well  how about the soggy  unflavored  lukewarm fries   Or the fish and chips where the cook managed to utterly ruin a promising piece of haddock   Tasteless too   On the plus side    the beer selection is impressive and people watching can be fun   And the popcorn was decent   I don t expect any improvement in the near future  as the Todd English PUB is crowded most times   It s amazing what constant hype on hotel TVs and hoards of tourists who don t use Yelp can do ,2,2012-02-22
I enjoyed Todd English P U B  very much  I ordered a mint chip shake to start  which is kind of backwards  but it was delicious  My friend and I stopped in on our way back from shopping and before getting ready for a show  After eating so much heavy food in Vegas  it was nice to be able to walk in somewhere and be out of there in an hour or less   The atmosphere is fun  and the location is great as it is near all the shopping at Crystals  I ordered the lobster cobb  and there was good amount of lobster on the salad  which made me a happy girl and I LOVE lobster  My friend had the roasted chicken pot pie  and it looked delicious as well    I m not sure why this place doesn t have better reviews  For what I was looking for at the time  an easy place to grab dinner in between shopping and a show  it hit the spot ,4,2014-01-06
Atendimento muito bom principalmente se for atendido pelo Brandon   Cara super legal  Comida muito boa  Happy hour vale muito a pena conferir ,5,2013-12-14
I came in thinking that it was open till   o clock in the morning and the bartender rudely chewed me out saying that it was closed at    in the morning and no exceptions  My brother tried to show the bartender their Yelp page which showed the wrong hours but he gave us a  who do you think you re talking to look   Avoid this pretentious and overall horrible service establishment at all costs as there are plenty of places on the strip that would appreciate your money and feedback  Trust me  ,1,2015-12-28
Came here on a Friday night for an early dinner before a show at the Cosmopolitan Boulevard Pool   Sat outside on the patio and was instantly greeted by our server    so we thought   We ordered drinks and never saw her again   Had to ask the hostess after    minutes if we could order some food  because our complimentary popcorn was not going to be sufficient for a night of drinking   Our food order was taken by another server who stated there was a shift change and she would take our order for our server   Our food was then served by another server  still not ours  who we asked for a second round from   The second round came out by another server  finally  our server   who completely ignored us until we had to ask beg  him for our check  The food was bar food  which would have been ok had the service been even remotely acceptable  which it wasnt  I did leave there happier than the man who got a glass of sangria dumped on him by his server though  What a mess ,1,2013-04-15
Best  Lobster Roll  Ever  Beer challenge is great  too ,5,2016-04-26
I love this PUB in Vegas  My husband and I love to go to Happy Hour here from     everyday  Craft beers are    and Oysters are cheap during this time  I think this place would be a bit pricey anytime other than happy hour  It gets busy during happy hour  so make sure you go around    Enjoy ,5,2017-03-20
Very expensive Bloody Mary s  we went on a Sunday to try them but didn t realize one would be over      Service was slow but they were very busy   Our bartender was very friendly ,3,2015-05-15
Great beer selection   Good pub food   Not too many health options but the few things I ve tried have been good ,4,2014-11-23
Based off some other reviews  I think we may have just had an isolated bad experience  but we nonetheless had a bad experience   First of all  nice beer selection   Great happy hour specials  For a place claiming to be super knowledgeable about beer  the quality beer was served far too cold   Not to sound like a beer nerd  but good beer shouldn t be served so freezing that I miss much of the taste and smell   Our waitress was  well  not nice to put it diplomatically   She was clearly overworked  but she ignored us repeatedly for unknown reasons   I gathered she got forced to work later than expected  but well  these things do happen   The waitress also seemed to suggest I was stupid when I politely declined her suggestion of another beer when she said the beer I wanted was not available  she recommended a beer that was not comparable    I suppose I might give it another try given the good reviews  but it would be tough given the service and beer situation ,1,2012-03-17
We came here to grab a quick ish dinner before heading out to a show   Being a PUB type restaurant  even if it s in the Crystals  I thought it d be just average all around  but was pleasantly surprised   When we arrived the hostess was apologetic and let us know that it might be a   minute wait for a sit down table  but it was nice she offered us a high table if we were in a hurry to get seated   A couple minutes wait was all it took and we were seated   Our waiter was friendly and attentive throughout our meal as were all the other who helped bring out our food   The food itself was pretty good   Nothing to knock my socks off  but it was all well prepared and tasty   The steak frites I got were both plentiful and delicious   If we re back in City Center I d definitely stop back in to P U B for dinner or drinks ,5,2014-04-21
I did t have mane expectation and was pleasant surprised ,4,2014-01-22
My friends and I recently went to Vegas and had a group  of     dinner at the P U B  The atmosphere was nice and the guys in the group were impressed with the very large beer selection  I had the Rojo Sangria and I m so happy I did  It was honestly the best I ve ever had  I normally go for the white  but the description bent me to the red    They have a raw bar to choose seafood from  I m not a seafood fan  but a couple people in the group got oysters and shrimp and they said they enjoyed it    Our server was lovely  I wish I remembered his name  He was super helpful and honestly steered us away from the Shepard s pie and swordfish  No one tried either  we re assuming for the better   I had the Pot Pie  It was pretty legit  It was nice and creamy and to my surprise had cheese in it   Luckily I am a big cheese fan   One of my favorite parts to a pot pie is the bottom crest that gets soaked in the gravy  Unfortunately  this pot pie is only covered with a puff pastry that was cooked separately  It was still really good though    Almost half our our table tried the fresh cut meat sandwiches  what I think they are known for   A few got the brisket on challah and really enjoyed it  My fiance got the crispy duck w  challah and was very happy with his duck    All in all it was a great time ,4,2011-08-17
Happy hour every day  pm  pm isn t clearly posted but it s     off any pint      off any glass of wine     oysters      sliders  and    wings  Unlimited free peanuts as a bar snack    being a neat freak  I tried to help them out by piling the shells in a napkin but the bartender actually asked me to throw them on the ground   Oysters were fresh   delicious  Service was very friendly  One star off because it s a bit on the pricey side      for Guinness    otherwise I d give it   stars ,4,2016-07-31
If I m going to be charged      for a standard eggs and bacon plate  and pay extra for toast  mind you  it better be the best eggs I ve ever had  Not the case here    My poached eggs came out basically hard boiled  RAGE ENSUES   I feel bad for tourists trapped on the Strip    Ponying up the big bucks to get a poorly prepared breakfast and a  no joke     domestic beer to cull the hangover  Do yourself a solid and Lyft off strip to a local breakfast joint where the food is actually good ,1,2017-07-31
We are locals and we had friends visiting from Iowa  Wisconsin and Phoenix   It was a gorgeous day in Las Vegas and we were looking to sit on an outside patio   We went to Todd English Pub and encountered the manager  Brad   We chatted with him and told him we were high school friends having a fun reunion with our husbands and he really took great care of us   Brad got us a table on the patio and even introduced us to the Chef   All of the staff was great and the food was amazing   We will take all of our out of town visitors to Todd English Pub   Thank you ,5,2012-04-20
My two girl friends and I wandered into Todd English to try the fruli strawberry beer  unfortunately the bartender said it was no longer being made     I forgot our bartenders name   either way    all of the staff were so accommodating  Since we had originally dropped in to try that specific drink and we aren t big beer drinkers  the bartenders let us sample a bunch of beers they thought we d like  All of the samples he gave us were more than enough for us to drink but we still ordered a glass of each of our favorites  We also decided to order cookies and ice cream  i know it s a strange combo with the beer and all but we were craving some sweets at the time  The bartenders were so friendly  chatted with us and the regulars who came by  I felt like we stepped into an episode of Cheers  When we asked for our bill  we saw they only charged us for   coke and the ice cream and cookies  we left happy and left them with a pretty big tip    stars for Todd English for their beer selection and especially their service   next time I plan to try the food   heard their pastrami sandwich is amazing ,5,2011-06-02
My goodness  I love this place  TIP  sit at the bar for the best service  The bartenders are great  Try their a Happy Hour and their St Bernard Beer on tap  If you like desserts  they have some of the best ,5,2017-01-06
I can t speak to any food here other than the dirty chips  or the naughty chips  or the filthy chips  or whatever they are called  except to say that you should get them   Get  Them   You and your cardiologist will thank me later   They are plenty for two to share and they are insanely good   I stuffed myself silly with them and would have eaten another full order if I had been wearing sweat pants with Spandex and didn t care about living maybe just a few years longer   The drink menu is frankly so varied and extensive as to be incredible and the prices are high for just about all food and drinks on the menu  but you re in Las Vegas so I don t want to hear whining about high prices   If you pay a lot and get quality in return  I m ok with that   Last  the music is insanely  ridiculously  offensively  needlessly and obnoxiously loud   If I ever return  I m going to sit out on their little exterior patio  which is outside of the restaurant shell even though you are still in a covered mall    which is too bad because the interior of this joint is attractive   I am not into shouting and losing my voice over a plate of raunchy chips just because some a hole thinks painfully loud and bad music equals  excitement  or something     Just sit on the patio  get the heinous chips  order some drinks  and enjoy ,4,2013-01-23
Good food overall  A little pricey for what it is  but I guess than can be expected for the location  The Adult Milkshakes were excellent ,3,2015-11-28
came here for dinner on night two of a bachlorette party   made reservations and seated right by the door which i was a little perturbed by   but friends head up  the portion sizes are ginormous here   i can eat and i barely ate half my shepard s pie   i should have shared with my pal who had eaten about the same on her pie   felt really bad since i couldn t exactly get a doggie bag     oh yes  the dirty fries are a must for a group   greasy potato chips and some chicken liver   what s not to love      oysters ,3,2011-09-05
This place is one of the few eateries in Aria that isn t snobby or stuffy  The atmosphere is comfortable and hip  Moreover  not everything on the menu will cost you an arm and a leg  We took advantage of the snacks and appetizer menu and were pleasantly surprised with the good sized portion and gourmet quality of this otherwise casual restaurant  I recommend the lobster poppy        which was our table s favorite dish for the night  The sandwiches are great too and come with a a variety of gourmet condiments like truffle oil mayo  I don t drink beer but from what I hear  the chocolate beer is worth tasting  Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a relaxed place to enjoy a bite with friends ,4,2011-07-19
It was our honeymoon and I had done a ton of research on the best bloody Mary s in Vegas as they are one of our favorite drinks   We arrived in Vegas and Todd English was our very first stop  We bellied up to the bar  prepared to pay the     dollar price per bloody but was informed that they only serve them on the weekends  No problem  We totally understood  The bartender  feeling bad that it was our honeymoon  called over the manager  John   who expressed how badly he felt and told us that we should come back the next couple of days and he would give us two bloodys on the house  which we didn t expect  we really were just excited about trying them   We made it a point to schedule a time to head back over to get the much antipated drink and when we got there the manager  John   told us he was sorry that there was no one there who knew how to make them  I wanted to leave but my husband said we should just order a couple of drinks anyway  And we did  I assumed  in good manners  the manager would at least comp our     drinks as a courtesy  In reality the most bothersome part was that we made time to go back there because of someone who was quite literally blowing smoke  While we were there  another couple asked if they could turn on the olympics  to which the bartender replied  it s up to my manager what we watch and so they left  Poor customer service  Very disappointing  Would NOT recommend ,1,2016-08-19
Burger was enormous  The burger was tasty  but without the pastrami  kraut   swiss topping  the burger wasn t greatly flavorful  The skinny fries were great  Our waiter was attentive and friendly  The atmosphere is noisy  but an overall pleasant lunch dining experience ,4,2015-01-17
What a great place for breakfast  lunch  or dinner   The beer list is extensive and amazing   There is something on there for everyone  whether or not you are a beer lover   The food is equally amazing  the steamed mussels are one of my favorites   It s a fun  energetic atmosphere   I always make sure to hit this place up whenever I am in town ,4,2014-09-05
All I can say is Lobster Rolls  Lobster Rolls  Lobster Rolls   They were so amazing that I want to go to Vegas just to have them again   The wait staff was pretty awesome   Ordered a cider beer and the guy brought a shot of FireBall to go with it    Apple Cinnamon goodness   Their gratis apps of popcorn is different too   Hidden gem in Vegas for sure ,4,2015-01-28
After reading the reviews  I had to find out what all the buzz was about  A couple of Boddingtons and a lobster roll later  I am convinced that the rave reviews are completely justified  Best lobster roll this side of Boston  Super fast service and a great atmosphere  A bit pricey but worth it ,4,2014-12-30

We came to watch a soccer game and asked if they re going to show it and the hostess told us they will  We found out theyre not showing it after we sat on the bar and asked the bartenders if they can switch the channel after we waited for    minutes with nothing happening  Eventually we decided to leave  Also there was a bartender who was very rude to us while we sat there  didn t pay attention to us and waved us with a laughing smile when we left ,1,2014-08-19
AMAZING food    Always come here for the lobster rolls and they NEVER disappoint  More so amazing service by Corey M    He was absolutely fantastic  Really nice and outgoing guy  He made the experience here   x better   Thank you Corey   ,5,2016-01-02
I was at the Aria for the ABS conference and I scheduled all my lunches here because of the convenient location  and the excellent food and beer selection    The service was excellent my clients loved the Sheperds Pie  the Meat Loaf was incredible  the Mushroom tacos delicious and you can t beat the Fish N Chips   Todd s English Pubb  was convient  with fabulous service and my clients stuffed and happy ,5,2016-03-06
I wish I could put in   stars but was hoping to really rate this place  Tried getting in there to eat last night  There were about   available tables out doors  We went to see if we can get a table and we were told that the waitress was too busy to have any more customers  Really  Understand if places get busy but how could you send customers away  Where were other employees  Very disappointed that we couldn t eat there  I ll never go back ,1,2016-04-21
this place should be replaced  It s in the new Citycenter development between   great hotels and its far from par of its surroundings  First of all  I felt that they didn t have a big selection of beers and that disappointed me from the start  After we waited a while to get our food  most of us were pretty disappointed with that as well  I could barely eat part of my shepherds pie  another person at the table didn t enjoy their burger  seriously how hard is it to mess up a burger   and it seemed that most people didn t even finish their meals  The only person who really enjoyed their meal was my girl friend with her chicken pot pie  This place has Vegas prices but the quality falls far behind  Todd English needs to learn how to cook good  English  food and improve the quality and quantity of the beer selection ,1,2012-06-12
Food is ehhh  but the complimentary bucket of buttery popcorn is a nice touch   By the time the food came around  I was already full   The lobster rolls came piled with pretty good lobster  but with greasy buns and a side of coleslaw   The mussels were not memorable  and the dirty chips were not slathered in enough of anything   We came here because it was close to Aria and wanted a bite to eat before heading home  and a Todd English eatery   Probably won t be back ,2,2014-03-24
Pretty damn lame  The prime rib b was     fatq and not well seasoned  The service was lame  The live music was a nice touch but not great  Don t bother  Just another weak Vegas food trap ,2,2018-06-30
Bleh    that s all I can say about the food  Service was kinda slow too  I wasn t expecting much from a pub but it still was disappointing ,3,2017-08-03
We decided to stop in here for some apps and beers after checking out the City Center area   The beer selection here is pretty good with some local craft brews on the menu   The beers in general are a bit pricey tho     for a Stella and     for a Delerium Tremens      We sat in the bar area and the atmosphere is very open and comfortable   Easy to hold a conversation and would be a nice place to take a date for drinks   The apps were good   I got the sliders and they were very tasty   However  the service ended up being poor as our waitress seeemed to disappear for about    minutes leaving us with empty glasses   I would have gone with three stars but as I came out of the bathroom  the sink area is shared by both guys and gals   a couple girls were giggling and fooling around and ended up making out with each other    Anytime you can go to a bar and see a couple girls play some tonsil hockey with each other deserves an extra star ,4,2010-04-23
This place sucked      Over priced  Food  sub par  Had the sliders          three tiny  dry  flavorless tasters  The place itself looked amazing  Service was good  Just very  very disappointed in the food and the prices        for a pint in dogfish head    Crazy  I will not recommend the place to anyone ,1,2013-09-01
I was extremely impressed with pretty much everything here   Yes  you re in Vegas and everything is more expensive   But as far as gastropubs go  this one is up there with the best of everything   Everything we had was amazing  from the tuna poke appetizer and the house made chips  to the entrees   I had a chicken pot pie  advertised as made with a veloute   which was killer   Creamy delicious inside  perfect fluffy crust   Served absurdly hot though   The best tasting thing on the table was probably the lobster rolls   Perhaps the most beautiful looking sandwich I ve ever seen  from bright red lobster meat to glistening buttery rolls   I also heard great feedback on the swordfish enchilada      and the fish   chips   Everything is done real well here   Don t forget the absurdly large and delicious beer selection ,5,2011-05-26
We were brought here before a big night out  so we knew it was time to fuel up  We had a group of   and were seated promptly  The place was busy  so there was a few hiccups in getting our waiters attention  but it was nothing major    I ordered the fish and chips  It was good  but the fish wasn t as crispy as I would ve expected it to be  Everyone eyed my one friend jealously  she ordered the lobster roll and raved about it  If I ever have the chance to go back  I would definitely opt for that  As far as prices go  I felt it pretty well priced for what you got  Over all good experience ,3,2014-03-07
Always a staple when I come to vegas  but I usually don t have a Brit with me to give their   bits on what the food is like here  So the last time I went I had one such Brit come with  His responses were great  very excited about the menu and pleased with the outcome  his highlight was the mead  Ok so I ve never had mead other than the bottle here and there from Bevmo  so to try the mead here was exceptional  It actually made our night much better    The waitress was sweet and attentive  though we were a bit perplexed that a restaurant would close at   pm  and the waitress explained that all bars need to close at   p    but this is a Pub   right   it s a bar that serves food     which is a Pub     it still closes at   pm    well I tried    Because you can go to any number of restaurants with bars or other Pubs along the strip and eat drink till  am  That s really the only reason I d drop it a star    I mean the Irish stay open till  am        Enjoy ,4,2017-12-10
great spot to stop by for dollar beers on the    bars of christmas      dollar blue moons     enough said     Didnt really check out the food here   just beers lol   Great service   I also did the beer challenge here  which is finish a pint in under   seconds and the beer is on them  Rules are you cant spill or throw up  i did mine in   seconds flat    good to still know i still got it ,5,2011-12-23
Great beer selection   You better go at HH or else your paying     a beer   I like the bartender s here ,4,2016-07-19
This is a very casual restaurant   I like their lobster sandwich  onion rings  and duck bum   The salad was just okay ,3,2012-01-29
How can I explain the   different waiters we had and the    minute  wait  Well  we were told our order was cancelled but it had been put in again  Oh  but don t worry because you ordered a medium rare burger and it doesn t take long    All in all  this place is expensive mediocre food but crappy service  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else  ,1,2014-12-06
My friend and I came in here on a whim after a long morning of pai gow poker  We were totally suckered in by the huge Happy Hour sign     wings     oysters and    sliders    The restaurant seemed really busy  so we didn t want to wait for a table  Luckily  there were a couple bar stools open  so we were able to snag a seat rather quickly  The bartender was running around    but didn t seem to notice me or my friend  We sat there awkwardly for a while until he finally brought us some menus  He didn t really talk to us  and he barely cracked a smile  Usually I love chatting up people at the bar  but this bartender just didn t seem very friendly at all     star for the unfriendly service  We ordered a couple of oysters and sliders  The oysters were fresh  but I ve had better  The sliders were good    but again nothing to rave about  We got to sample some beer from New Zealand  they were doing some sort of promotion   The beer was fantastic  Really light and refreshing  It was exactly what I needed on a hot Vegas day   Nice pub in the heart of the City Center  but I don t know if I d actually come back for more  The food and beer were both good  but the service was seriously lacking  There are so many great restaurants in Vegas  and this one definitely didn t wow me like others have ,3,2012-08-16
The build your own sandwich thing on the menu was really yummy  I had the turkey and my bf had the corned beef  Both were really tender  The black truffle mayo on the side was also really tasty  They have a huge beer menu if you re in to that kind of thing  I wish the ambiance had been more cozy and pub like  but it was still nice  Our server was very nice and attentive  The food came out really quickly  It wasn t crowded when we went for lunch and I found the prices to be reasonable for Las Vegas ,4,2011-07-28
Stopped in here for a few drinks before heading out for the night  Kelly greeted us at the bar and started our tab off with a few drinks  She was amazing   Shanna kept asking us if we needed refills and served us a few appetizers  I would highly recommend this place for food and drinks  and especially the excellent service we got with these two at the bar ,5,2017-01-16
I ve been here before and it s really good  However they make it very difficult when getting a table  They will tell you to take a table in the bar and you do and it s not ok  Instead of the waiter going to ask if it s ok they want you to get up and walk back over there  It s just rude and makes you feel unwanted  I came here on a Thursday and a lot of the waiters were just standing around on their phones or just talking to each other  They serve you free popcorn but when I told the guy who brought it that I was ok on having it he just turned and walked away  I was just trying to save you a wasted bucket of popcorn  Incentive was the free corona light  I would like to continue coming here when in town but the service has got to get better ,3,2015-11-20
Great Great Food  Horrible Horrible service   Some of the best chili cheese fries on the plant  They had Ephemere on tap a super big plus   The negative things about this place  The waiter hit on my girlfriend the entire night  and said and did inappropriate things  Total douche bag  He was always around when you didn t need him  and never around when you needed something  The big ticker was he offered me and my girl complementary Patron shots for deserts  but charged us at the end of the night on the bill for the shots  When I tried to ask about it another waiter came up and said our original waiter is on a freaking smoke break  What a scam artist  Vegas Style   Todd English you have a bad server working for you  but great food ,3,2011-03-21
This is my  rd visit to Todd English and have had a GREAT experience every time   It is my new go to place when we visit   It is LOUD  so get ready to shout over the tvs  music and rowdy crowd  especially at night   The food is amazing   It is cute that they start you off with a little bucket of popcorn   Under appetizers  the mini corn dogs and the duck buns are tremendous   The grown up grilled cheese is delicious  but you MUST have a taste for brie   This last visit i had the brisket from the carvery where you choose your meat  type of bread  and   specialty spreads to make a sandwich   The meat is sold by     or full pound   The brisket was terrific on marbled rye with horseradish sour cream and black truffle mayo   Their skinny fries are really tasty    Dad had the chicken pot pie  which was rich and creamy   Mom had the sliders that come in     Sister had a salad  can t remember the name  it had lettuce  tomato  cucumber  and topped with kettle chips   It was different  but really tasty  There are a number of beers on tap and they even make specialty beer cocktails    On our way out  we use the  gumball machine  to purchase a beer pong ball with the Pub s name on it   FUN  P S  We had GREAT service every visit ,5,2011-03-21
TERRIBLE food   Beer wasn t cold and often flat   Two other parties at the bar sent their food back as well   Don t get suckered into the  Todd English  moniker   A shame considering everything else at Aria is quite good   You can find MUCH better on the strip ,1,2017-02-20
we stayed at city center and had some time to kill between check out and our flight so we went here bc it was super close  to continue with our one meal a day during this trip     we split the apps    chicken wings  had a nice kick from the spice  corn dog puppies  mini corndogs with fries   i liked these the best  roast beef sliders  only thought these were ok   this isn t a place i d crave on my next visit but i wouldn t mind giving it another shot  ,3,2011-08-27
This review would have been   stars without a doubt except for the exceptionally bad customer service by the hostess  We arrived promptly for our reservation for   people  hostess told us she couldn t find the reservation and told us to step aside so she could seat other people  We came from   states for a birthday dinner and ended up at   separate tables   The food was exceptional  our waiter was awesome but the hostess totally ruined the celebration for our group  Also everyone noted she was not dressed liked someone representing any classy establishment  Very seldom do I give a bad review but this one is deserved ,1,2014-10-12
My boyfriend and I were in Vegas for just a few nights but I knew I wanted to come here when I saw the Candy Corn Martini featured on the Todd English P U B  Facebook page  We were staying way off the strip for a conference but I called and spoke with a friendly and helpful hostess named Shahia  I know I just jacked up the spelling of her name  Sorry   She was so sweet telling us the best way to find the place since we were taking the monorail  When we made it  we greeted each other like old friends  I loved that   We sat outside so my boyfriend could see a bit  of the World Series on the outdoor TV  We had Corey as our sever  he was just as friendly and fabulous as Shahia  We started with martini s  my one Candy Corn martini was enough   it was VERY SWEET but so festive   We ordered the Ahi Tuna Tar Tare as a starter   This was so delish  I highly recommend it  I had Steak Tacos and my BF had the Sheperd s Pie which was also very very good    We had a great time and a great dinner  Maybe too many Strongbow Ciders and Fireball  but hell   we were in Vegas  We really enjoyed our last evening there and the service Corey and Shahia provided was great  We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas    I highly recommend anyone else to visit Todd English P U B  also  you will not be disappointed  Thanks  ,4,2013-10-26
We came here because we were staying at the Aria and were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and service  We started with the buffalo chicken lettuce wraps which were delicious  We tried the burger  steak tacos  chicken Caesar salad and house made sweet pickles  The portions were huge and everything tasted amazing  Our favorite was the house pickles   a combination of dill and sweet  Would definitely recommend ,5,2015-12-30
My friends and I were pleasantly surprised and pleased with this restaurant after reading not so good reviews  Nice variety of craft beers  yes they are expensive  They bring you popcorn to snack on  My husband and I split the lobster roll and it was delicious  We sat in the bar area and service was helpful and speedy  No complaints ,5,2015-01-06
My husband was so excited to try this place out   And it was good starting out   greeted by cute  friendly hostesses  fun decor ambience  and then the food arrives    My husband got the lobster roll   said the bread to lobster ratio was way off   My son got the chili   I know it s on the appetizer list  but it s     and the portion was laughably small   My son s    and he was frustrated at how little he got   My daughter got the duck buns   I should ve known better than to order duck buns at a pub  my fault   Not good at all   Finally  I got the mussels   Small  sandy  and there were at least   that just did not taste right    so much so that I actually warned my husband that if I were to get food poisoning later that night  the mussels would be to blame   Ugh     So when we had finally trudged through our bad food  guess the small portions weren t such a bad thing after all   and then we got a huge bill at the end that just seemed way overpriced for the quality of the food we got  it just added insult to injury   We really regretted wasting a perfectly good meal opportunity there  and won t ever go back again ,1,2014-08-21
Okay  I ate here twice   Both times  I gotta say  in comparison to the overpriced crap you get on the strip  these guys deliver   Service was genuine and kind   The beer selection is pure madness  hence the   instead of   stars    I mean  seriously  These guys know beer   And the food is lip smacking killer   I got on both occasions  fish and chips  welsh rabbit  and portabella mushroom burger    No misses at all   Can t believe they are on the same property as the Aria   Tip  get the skinny fries  Tip  Enter through mall entrance to get into the right seating line  Tip  Ask for the local beers  some tasty surprises await  Tip  They have Tabasco and Cholula ,5,2012-06-14
Come for the great draft beer selection and the tuna burger  Make sure you ask for Chris as your server  he was awesome ,4,2014-02-18
Great ambience and great food  Try the Lobster Rolls  you get actual chunks of lobsters on a sweet roll with some criss cut fries and accompanied with a cold beer ,4,2015-02-15
Had a better experience here for brunch  We shared the steak and eggs  I would definitely get this again  and also the open faced egg sandwich that was also good  The best part was the  meat and potatoes  Bloody Mary  Now that was fun ,4,2015-07-12
Great bartender   Crystal F  is very professional  and she effortlessly charmed every bar patron  including me     New Amsterdam burger sandwich is great  Fried pickles and beers too    Grilled cheese left a lot to be desired  as did disappointing fried oysters  Overpriced generally but not at all unreasonable for hotel prices   Happy hour pricing makes a big difference  One of the better options at Aria ,4,2013-01-10
Great place for food and drinks on a laid back night out  My husband and I just shared a few appetizers  We had fried pickles  mini corn dogs  duck buns  ahi tuna poke  and buffalo chicken lettuce cups  The French fries under the corn dogs were the best part and the tuna was fantastic  The buffalo chicken was a little dry and overcooked  but it was still good  We wanted to try the adult milkshakes for dessert but we were stuffed  The portion size was pretty big for each appetizer and we couldn t finish  We d definitely go back though ,4,2016-02-20
The quality of the food is three stars but they had exceptional service that made me want to give them four stars  We came on a weekend so the wait time was   hour  but it s also because it was a group of    girls  My friend and I shared the lobster roll  Mac   cheese  and we also had the onion rings  The lobster roll is a lot smaller than it looks in pictures  but it s so savory and buttery that we couldn t even finish it  The lobster itself was fresh but the lobster roll was a bit too heavy and creamy for me  It was like a creamy lobster on top of a buttery garlic soft bread  The Mac and cheese was REALLY cheesy  It was great Mac and cheese the first couple of bites but the towards the bottom we couldn t even finish anymore  The top half was perfect because it was nicely toasted and topped with panco  But  although the food was mediocre    The service was amazing  The workers go out of the way to cater the customers  we had asked to sub the chips for fries when our food had already came out and they let us keep the chips and gave us fries ,4,2015-01-10
We stopped in here during our recent trip to Vegas to hang out and grab some snacks and beers  I checked in with my YELP account and got a free beer offer  Unfortunately my only choice was a Bud Light  the only beer on the extensive menu under      Not being one to look a gift horse in the mouth  I took it while the rest of my party indulged in a couple of Mamma s Little Yella Pills and a Moscow Mule served in the traditional copper mug    Apps are typical pub food  Lots of fried finger foods and sliders to choose from  We got the onion rings which were ginormous and crispy  We also went for the duck buns which although I did not partake  they looked really good  I was resisting temptation as we had dinner reservations later that night  This place can definitely spoil your appetite    The washrooms have an attendant on duty so bring some small bills for tips ,4,2015-04-27
Had the duck sandwich  pita bread   black truffle mayo  So good n Chloe my server bartender was not only HOT but very nice n so knowledgable about food   Thx TE Pub   Defiantly comin back ,4,2012-08-02
Great service great food  Try the lobster rolls and the wedge salad  Jorge the waiter rocks very friendly  Will definitely comeback when we are in Vegas,4,2014-09-13
The Lobster Roll is legit New England  Not a fan of the cole slaw though  Today it had WAY too much onion  The home made pretzels are fawesome  Gotta get those  And the beer selection  is good too    second beer challenge is based on the  ziggy zaggy ziggy zaggy oy oy oy  chant from the Man Show ,4,2016-05-08
The worst fish and chips ever  The fish   what little there was   was dark and slimy  the coating was mainly thick breading  Given it was lunch for    a total cost of over     was outrageous for the awful quality of the food    huge disappointment  Would never go back ,1,2014-08-14
  star for the beer selection another star for the looks of the bar and the third star is for the happy hour deals they have     star for not having   of the   beers I actually wanted    star for our waitress who asked  do you want another drink   and when my wife responded  not yet  the waitress put the bill on the table and walked away  I don t know about you  but I m pretty sure  not yet  means that you would like another drink when you finish the one you have  I don t think it means  not yet  we are done and you can push us out the door even though it s nowhere near closing time and you definitely don t need this table  ,3,2012-05-20
Overpriced pub food  Wafles was drowned in syrup  Fish and Chips were overpriced for the quality  Quantity was good and filling but still not worth the price ,1,2015-11-04
Really good place great happy hour the wings are ridiculous good and the beer selection is outstanding,5,2016-01-08
I was fortunate to tag along with Blair B  and her husband Mike en route to their friend s birthday dinner at PUB   I got a pint of the Irish cream beer  and it was okay   not worth ordering again but needed after some stress   The three of us shared   pounds of meat     of crispy duck leg and   of lamb loin   We got challah and kaiser rolls  and four different sauces   I will stop right now and say get the black truffle mayo as everyone else says   I am not a mayo eater or even much of a condiment person  but that mayo is ridiculously good   The lamb was great on its own or with the challah and mayo   The duck was crispy and delicious   I liked the pickles that came with the dishes   the only odd thing is four people at our table ordered half yards of beer  a certain part of the woodwork at this PUB Bar  yet the waiter told us the place ran out of yard glasses     What       We hardly saw any on tables  and it was only like   PM   Strange   He ended up giving the bday girl and her husband  the last   in the whole restaurant  and gave Blair B  and Mike B    pints instead  so they may have lost out on   oz each      In the end it was just a nice experience   It was pretty loud in there and hard to hear  but the patio seems quieter for a next visit   Our waiter started off crabby but ended up pretty nice and refilled waters often   I am glad we came and conquered the carvery ,4,2011-06-26
Awesome bar   The food is very good and be ready to wait   If you sit at the bar they have this   second hour glass every other seat  You can get free beers from this concept  if you are brave   Barkeep will turn it over and you have   seconds to finish it  which means not a drop on you   Totally doable   Due to them having PBR and or Guinness   Get the grilled cheese sandwich   They have this crazy panini press that actually puts grill canals on the bread   It s very good ,4,2010-03-22
Great pub  Right next to Aria so if you re staying there this place is ideal for a few pre game pints    Lots of TVs  Huge crowd  Very lively place  Happy hour from     with half price pints  at least it is now on a Friday     I have heard comments about bad service but the folks helping us at the bar have been fantastic  Courtney is amazing  Short staffed and she s still covering the whole bar    Second time I ve been here and both times this place didn t disappoint ,4,2014-04-26
If you want to have drink this seems to be the place   Lots of choices in beer and bloody marys   We went for fish and chips and had been wanting them for quit sometime   The portions are large and we split our meal  but the fish was so greasy we will not be eating fish and chips anytime soon ,3,2013-07-12
My Caesar salad was one of the worst  drenched in dressing  almost inedible  Overpriced for the quality of food and the service provided ,1,2017-01-01
Location   P U B was very accommodating to our party of      There was no wait and our table was set up perfectly   The servers were tentative    Food   I still ordered the Lobster Rolls even after some of the negative reviews on Yelp that they changed there bread from a nice toasted brioche to a soggy sweet hawaiian dinner roll   I expressed my concern regarding the bread and he assured me that they switched back to their original recipe and bread   Wrong   It was the same sweet hawaiian dinner roll   Not worth it for       It definitely does not compare to the delicious Lobster Rolls from Boston         The appetizers were good   Go for the Shepard s pie   You can t go wrong with this hearty and satisfying dish   Overall  good for groups  great beer selection   Food   just so so   I give this place   stars ,3,2011-08-30
My girlfriend and I went to this Public Urban Bar  come on guys  just call it a pub  after reading Matt C s glowing review on here  mostly because the lure of nickel PBR s could not be ignored forever   After finally figuring out how to get into the damn place  we took our seats and ate some food  and drank some real beer  until  PM  when the PBR party officially started   I tried the roast beef sliders  which were about as tasty as the roast beef sandwiches at Arby s  That is  worth about three bucks  They couldn t be simpler  either  Roughly four inches of roast beef between two buns with  I think  some sort of aioli thrown in so it at least has some sort of flavor  I love roast beef as much as the next guy  but these sliders were just too much  These suckers cost me thirteen smackers  which they are definitely not worth  The nickel beers  if you can call PBR beer  were definitely nice  but the mediocrity of my meal stuck with me   I m not going to get into details about my adventure today trying to recover the debit card I left at the P U B  last night  but let me give you a piece of advice  Never deal with the City Center security   lost and found department if you can avoid it  I m pretty sure it s the entire staff s first day  every day   Between the moderate inaccessibility compared to other pubs in town  the extremely high prices on everything  seriously  nine bucks for a Blue Moon    and the unremarkable food  I can t recommend this place unless you ve got friends who really insist on meeting up there    or you go on a Tuesday night for some really cheap  in multiple senses  beer  I hear the actual burgers are actually quite good though  so maybe I ll try one soon  I ll have to save up for a while first  though ,2,2010-05-27
Food was good pub food  Service was mediocre  The beer is way over priced  Good selection but     for a pint of US brewed IPA is much higher than even NYC or SF ,3,2014-11-28
Very low quality food and extremely poor service  Went here after seeing a better recommendation from a different site  That was a mistake and should have check Yelp first  It is very disappointing  While the atmosphere at first appears very good  the food and service are a miss  Tons of great places to eat in Las Vegas so this should not make your list ,2,2017-10-29
Food and drinks were great   Service was quite possibly the slowest I ve ever seen   Drink prices are punitive at best   They are very proud of their alcohol   I would only come here at happy hour when the prices are only very high ,2,2016-03-19
Let me start with saying that I work in the Restaurant Business  I have managed several different restaurants  from pubs to fine dining    Where do I start     Service  My waiter   Eric  seemed a little lost  Frantic  disorganized  and it looked like he was freaking out to the busser about condiments  You would think this would happen in the back of the house and not in front of the table he is taking care of   Food  We ordered some appetizers  which arrived    minutes after our entrees  AWESOME    Come on      Onion rings  don t take more than   minutes in the fryer     The food was decent  I got to admit  The fish and ships tasted pretty good  Never thought to have fish at the desert  Freshly de frosted      Trust me  I know       I lived in Florida  and I can tell     Staff  I always like to walk around the place I eat at to check for organization   old habit  and at times I learn something new     But here  It seemed over staffed  A lot of employees just going around in circles and avoiding things that needed to be taken care of   On my way to the restroom could not help to notice a young girl that my guess is supposed to be the polisher  just being on her phone  while one of the bussers seemed a little frustrated about resetting tables and not having anything to reset with   I understand that reviews are intended for other people and not management  but how to transfer the message      One more thing      I m sure the food runner noticed me just standing in the middle of the walkway looking at the chef  This poor guy looked overwhelmed  while   runners are just standing there with a pile of tickets in front of them and a row of dishes ready to be ran in the hot window     Come on       It s frustrating to see such a place with this potential go to hell for the lack of team work   I will go back and give it a second review      I hope management pay a little more attention     It s a great place  but needs tightening up   ,2,2013-03-23
The food was delicious   We especially appreciated being able to taste various beers so that we both ended up with exactly what we wanted   And that s where our joy ended   The bar wasn t Especially crowded at the lunch hour but our server felt the tip opportunities were better at the other end of the bar   The only other server felt his time was better spent flirting with the waitresses   Our order came out wrong but it was necessary for us to hail another server as ours never checked in to see how we were doing   Three stars out of five for good food but lousy service   Oh  and I m a start at     and its up or down depending on your service kind of girl ,3,2016-04-02
We were staying Aria resort and decided to give this place a go and wow lucky we did  Great pastrami carvery open sandwich which we shared between the two of us  And also the spicy chicken wings with hot sauce is tasty but wish there were more in one portion  Crispy and juicy  Great selection of beers  perfect for a warm day in Vegas  Waiter knows their beers so don t be afraid to ask for recommendations and they would even give you a taster if you re unsure  Free   light Corona when you check in at Yelp   ,4,2015-05-18
This place is not too shabby   However  they did messed up on my order   I ordered their chicken parmasan slider  but they managed to give me BLT slider   I kept the fries that came with the BLT slider and asked them to correct my order   Now I have two bucket of fries  which were delicious   The dirty chips were something else   Overall a good dining experience ,3,2011-08-03
Decided to try this place after reading reviews  The service was horrible  Took forever to order food and they didn t even care to bring us utensils or plates  We ordered the crab cake sliders and the lobster rolls  The food wasn t good at all  The crab cake sliders tasted horrible and the lobster was too chewy  Avoid this place if you are looking for good food  The food is totally not worth the money ,1,2014-04-24
Marginal place  Not bad  but not great either  Too expensive for what I got  I would have been better off going to Shake Shack  Skip this place for something cheaper or something better ,2,2016-01-09
We loved this place  It was packed during NCAA tournament weekend  but we were able to find a spare seat at the bar while we waited for a table  They told us there would be a    minute wait and it was probably less than     We had a great corner table with a great view of the basketball games  The drink selections were great for both the beer drinker and the non beer drinker  which is unusual for a pub  i was able to enjoy a lovely sparkling rose while my DH enjoyed some wonderful draught beer     They also have some really cool tables with taps in the middle that it looks like you can use a credit card and serve yourself  That was awesome  The menu is also great  There were so many great sounding choices  we started with a dozen oysters which were very fresh and very good  i followed it up with the sliders which are served with carmelized onions  blue cheese and      island dressing and fries  They were soooo good  My DH had the lobster rolls  which were also   mini lobster rolls and came with homemade potato chips and slaw  He is still talking about those sliders    We would go back in a heartbeat ,4,2012-03-27
The food was okay at best had a   shrimp cocktail appetizer and fish and chips  My bill was over      has to be the most overpriced place that I ve eaten in Vegas for the quality which was fair at best I would avoid this place other than for a beer ,2,2014-02-27
This review is based on a brunch  here s the breakdown   Food      Atmosphere      Service       Food  I ordered the corned beef  potato  with egg on top skillet   I found it to be pretty bland   The corned beef itself was good but the potato cubes had no flavor   I thought the egg on top was going to be a sunny side up egg  but it seems to have been over cooked and was more of a sunny side up hard boiled egg   My wife had the cured salmon bagel tacos and they were pretty good and creative   We also had a side of pickles  different flavors   I expected something like a New York deli pickles but there didn t seem to be much variety in the group   Atmosphere  It is loud in here   This is a hotspot for the hangover crowd  their specialty is organic bloody mary s    The decorum is simply   pub   Service  We waited about    minutes before our waitress made it over   When my wife asked what cure salmon was   I had already told her it was cold smoked salmon but she didn t believe me  the waitress replied that it was grilled   When we got the dish it was indeed cold smoked salmon   To say the least  service is lacking    we saw the waitress just before as it was time to see the bill the second time   Prepare to fend for yourself   Would I come back   Maybe,3,2012-12-01
I m disappointed this time    I order the same thing as last time  Prime beef sandwich   Last time    The meat melted in my mouth   This time it just stayed there   Not as good and a bit tough   I came for a late dinner and maybe I prime beef as getting cold and lost its juice   The black truffle mayo was missing some truffles and some of the fat fries were a bit wilty   Inconsistent and disappointed ,2,2010-10-14
Friendly staff  Angela behind the bar was great  Good drinks  Hi def wide screens with all the games on  Excellent  and creative  bloody mary selection  Fun place to hang during the day on the strip ,4,2013-11-04
I came sorta unknowingly because me and bf were meeting up with his fam   We were seated near the bar and there were tons of TVs everywhere and lots of enthusiastic sports fans     The beer list is super extensive and the food seemed pretty expensive    but hey it s Vegas   I wanted the Epic without Fermentation beer under their seasonals but I guess they were out so the server recommended the St  Bernardus   It was really strong for me  but it s ok I ordered it   I wasn t too hungry and ordered the junk chips based on yelpers suggestions and the other party ordered fried pickles   From looking at the only pic on yelp of the junk chips  my chips didn t really look like that   The chips on the yelp pic looks even spread  but when my junk chips came out the BBQ ragu was only like at the bottom chips and the bleu cheese was uneven and then like a lump of  scallions on the very top chip   As far as the flavors  the housemade chips were like thicker lays BBQ chips and I felt they were pretty salty and sweet which didn t compliment the overpowering flavors of the BBQ ragu and the bleu cheese   I don t know   Just not my favorite   The fried pickles were good   They were just thin thick enough with a nice coating   It came with   dipping sauces which were a housemade ketchup  sirracha ranch that was pretty spicy  and a bleu cheese dip     Overall I wouldn t make it a point to come here for lunch dinner but maybe a quick  expensive  snack because it was a nice place to relax ,2,2013-10-21
While in Vegas for the Super Bowl we ate at many  many good restaurants  This was one of them  Arriving for a late lunch after a morning of walking around we were quickly greeted and seated outdoors  Our waitress  Lauren  was fantastic  She was friendly  knowledgeable about the menu and beer list and lots of fun   The menu is pub fare but the upper end of the spectrum of pub fare  K was told that the tuna burger was life changing  N got the lobster rolls  our friend got a salad and I went with the caprese salad  While lots of things sounded good it was kind of hot and I just wanted to have something cold and light  We ordered an order of sweet potato fries for the table and Lauren had some honey mustard mixed up for us  thanks      We were blown away by the fantastic beer menu  Like wow  From favorites to things we can t get in Michigan but have wanted to try to things we ve never heard of there was a vast selection that was organized beautifully on the back of our menu    Everyone loved their food and all but our friend who was working and our exchange student enjoyed two beers    The lobster rolls were voted best at the table and my caprese salad  while beautifully presented  came in last  The tomatoes just had no flavor  I m not sure if it s not tomato season in Vegas or what but they were crazy bland  However  I can deal with such a little difference between best and worst when the best is so damn good  and had the toms been better my food would have been excellent     We will definitely come back here the next time we re in Vegas ,4,2013-02-20
So the insanity begins when you realize that if you can beat the    second  hourglass  timer affixed to the bar  your beer is free  Yes  you know what I mean  chug  chug  chug    you ve already lost ,3,2010-04-16
On a recent visit to Vegas we stayed at the Aria and the PUB is right next door   It was nice to have something close that wasn t as expensive as everything in the Aria   It was nice enough to sit outside  which was a cute patio and it was nice to spend some time outside   It was happy hour so we got cheap wings and oysters   We got just a few oysters to start  but since we loved them so much we got a few more after eating the wings   I love the asian sauce they with them that was different then what other places serve   The wings were good  but the oysters we remembered more   It was a perfect late day snack   They have a great beer selection with discounted pints during happy hour   I definitely recommend and the service was great too ,4,2014-12-17
The Chefs eating food from the pass area was unappetizing  All three of them were snacking the entire time we were there   for non industry folks  the pass is the table top where the food for the dinning room comes from   But I am sure I am the only one who noticed in my party and it did not stop everyone from chowing down  I got the pastrami slider dish with perfectly crisp fries  my dad the fish and chips and my uncle the cobb salad  In a previous visit my husband and I ordered several appetizers and  quite a few  a beer or two  They have a great beer selection and the flight option is a good idea if your a beer novice  Just tighten up the snacking off the plates and you ll get that  th star from me ,3,2011-08-31
It was my first visit at Todd English yesterday  and I m definitely coming back   They have great selection of tap  and great selection food to go with anything from regular lunch dinner options to craveable pub appetizers  Our Bartender Jared was a sweetheart  super attentive and patient as I took forever to decide what I would like to eat ,5,2016-12-08
The had the best French fries here that I have ever ate  It was crunchy and hot and perfect  I ordered the Bloody Mary that had everything on top  The toppings included a slider  chicken wing  celery  olives  asparagus  etc  it was strong got me buzz from it  They have a wide selection of beer here  I ordered some oysters as well and it was yummy  Definitely love the atmosphere as well  Great place ,4,2017-01-05
I came here with a group of friends for the happy hour special on a weekday  We had some food credit with Vdara  which sadly later on we found out the food from this establishment didn t count part of the food credit with Vdara program  darn  Even though we did ask the employees here at this restaurant whether it would count  and they said it would   lame    Regardless  this place is super over hyped and over priced  I didn t find any of the food to be fabulous or that great  We ordered   or   rounds of oysters  I found them to be small and nothing spectacular  Then we ordered   rounds of chicken wings which were yummy  And we also had the onion rings  which are HUGE  but I didn t find the flavor to be that great  but then again I m not a fan of onion rings    They need to bring down the prices at this establishment and maybe it ll be on the same level as the food quality    But then again it could be me  because I always see this place packed when I pass by ,3,2012-05-18
Walked in for lunch and drinks at    am on         We were greeted nicely by the hostess  and walked by ourselves into bar area   There was no bar space  so we sat a a tall table near the bar   We assumed that this area would have table service   We sat there for    minutes and at least   servers walked by our table   Neither person stopped   Would have expected for someone to come over to our table and ask to take our order  or to tell us that we had to order from the bar   We walked out   No one said a word to us as we left   We went to another eatery and spent usd     on lunch drinks   Sad to be ignored at a Vegas favorite of ours   May try again in future  but left bad impression ,1,2017-11-13
Awesome place  great service  Richard Baldino was an awesome server  Great beer selection  ,5,2012-09-22
I went to have lunch at this place on Sunday and after ordering what I thought would be a blue cheese burger turns out to be completely awful   Who ever thought this was a good idea doesnt know what they are talking about   The bartender that was serving us was not the best   Kinda annoying  after complaining about the food and not finding anything I would like to order instead I got the bill   Nothing was comp or discounted   I spent        on crappy bar food   would not return at all ,1,2014-03-19
Come for the build your own bloody Mary s  They have such fun toppings and a great mix base  You can easily make a meal out of the Bloody Mary alone  Perfect Vegas breakfast ,4,2016-06-03
P U B  has it going on my Yelp fans  They feature over two dozen beers on tap and several other hard to find brew bottled   The bartenders also make some wickedly delicious concoctions   I was at PUB last night celebrating a friends birthday and felt right at home   Darts  Beer Pong    second drink off  PUB was like being at my favorite neighborhood bar   At one point I didn t realize that a hundred feet away is the single largest Louis Vuitton in existence   That is the beauty of PUB  it takes the pompous  made of money  feeling out of Crystals     The menu isn t happy hour cheap like Yardhouse  BJ s  or PT s   However  the drinks  food  and service are all good      I urge you to give Todd English s PUB a try ,4,2010-04-01
Hmm this one s a bit of a toughie to quantify  One of the better servers I ve had anywhere  really knew his beers  checked on us at appropriate times  and just all around a swell guy  Great selection of beers but the prices are astronomical and that s by Vegas standards not your local bar  My Chimay was about     and we re talking the itty bitty bottle  Food was also hit and miss  Shepard s Pie was awesome and I had enough for two more meals out of it  but the pickles are disappointing and the clam chowder was watery and flavorless  I may venture in again  but I ll probably stick to my over priced trappist beer if I do ,3,2016-04-01
Came here with a large group and definitely enjoyed our time here   We got seated right away at a long table and great service throughout the meal   Unfortunately  missed the happy hour but drink prices were decent  given the location   high end shopping area on the Strip    I ordered the chicken pot pie and it was DELICIOUS   i m craving it right now as I write this   It was piping hot  great balance of filling vs crust  and the portion was huge   Others at the table seemed to be pleased with their meals as well but the fish and chips seemed to be small on the portion side   Would definitely recommend the pot pie and will try to get here next time for happy hour ,4,2012-12-19
Busy busy place    great happy hour specials  Great server    We will be back next time we are at the Aria ,5,2013-05-26
The Vibe  A pub and restaurant so you get the benefit of both    It s crazy on the weekends since they offer this  drink a pint in   seconds and it s free  deal   It s a trendy pub  not traditional and not divey   The Attire  It s at Crystals Shopping complext  which means        So you could dress low key  but may feel a tad out of place   More like Business casual   But woman will need to dress  sexy casual  to feel they fit in   Consider  They offer loads of European craft beer  so that s a plus  but don t expect anything offered by local breweries   Also  the location makes this place an expensive option   It s a beautiful pub  and on low key times like late weeknights  it s easy to get a seat and have some great convo with the bartenders ,4,2014-02-25
the best place on the strip   the beers are amazing    the staff is great   the food is great    great job for a place that just opened    go down and try to beat the   second hourglass beer challenge    great bar staff    food is out of this world   ,5,2010-05-10
OK I know Vegas has a lot of great places to eat  Here is another one  The bartender and the food couldnt ask for better services and food  Tuna tarta great start  Anything on the menu is great  My GF ate there all week ,4,2014-02-19
i would take a star off for the high prices but it s vegas   been twice for happy hour    their happy hour is awesome  carved lamb with sourdough  horseradish sour cream and soy maple sauce  skip the soy maple sauce but the lamb and horseradish were perfect together     bucks  oysters are   bucks each and very fresh  a bit small but i prefer them small and they are only   bucks    chilled shrimp was best i ever had even at      each  very big  king crab legs      bucks for a half pound and worth every penny  lobster rolls      bucks    very rich sauce    not very authentic but retarded good    dollar sliders during happy hour are excellent     bartenders took great care of us  Tom and Rod were really cool     their happy hour is impressive with half price pints      take the   second chug challenge and u get   free beers right there   disregard any bad reviews    sit at the bar and ask your bartenders whats up ,5,2012-03-19
oooooh so good  we were tight on time  got seated right away and our server arrived promptly wo take our order and provide excellent reccomendations Fish and chips battered and flaky fish perfectly cooked Lobster roll  omg the bread was buttered  panfried and stuffed with lobster meat smoked salmon quesidellia topped with crumbled egg and capers  salmon very fresh and fork tender,4,2010-06-03
This place is extremely overpriced   The service was ok  but I don t understand how you can charge     for a PBR in a brown bag with a shot of Jack   That is criminal   I had the     buffalo burger which I could hardly taste because the bun was so gigantic and the fries tasted like had come out of a frozen bag   I will not go back to this PUB   There much better places to eat in Vegas ,1,2011-02-25
Lots of food choices    and they are delicious  Some our group tried and loved    brie and bacon grilled cheese  fried oysters  fried pickles and sliders  Food good    service    not soo good  Slow and they dont seem to care  But if u can get beyond that   food is good ,4,2013-01-26
Buck J and I stumbled upon this place a couple weeks ago just after it opened   The best way I can describe this is  really effing good    Great beer selection to start with   We started with the Dirty Chips  which were amazing upscale nachos thing with house made potato chips  cheese and a whole bunch of awesome on the side   The middle portion of their menu is the  Carving Board    It s a great selection of house cured meats and you choose a bread and two sauces   basically make your own awesome sandwich   I got the brisket with sourdough bread  truffled aioli and pineapple teriyaki sauce   The teri sauce was awesome and I really liked the dish  definitely getting a different version of the carving board   Definitely be stopping by next time we visit Vegas  and this could easily be up to   stars pretty easy ,4,2010-04-06
I came to Todd English P U B  with about    coworkers for dinner during the week of our conference and was thoroughly impressed   They were able to accommodate our fairly large party without a problem   This was key in deciding where we would eat that night   Since there were so many of us we decided the best thing to do would be to order just about one of each appetizer and split them between everyone   This turned out to be such a great idea since the breadth of items on the menu is huge   I ended up having everything from lobster rolls to fried pickles to tuna   They have an excellent drink selection which completes the experience   I have to point one thing in particular   the horseradish that comes with the oysters on the half shell   It was like nothing I have ever had in my life   I really mean it   It was so strong and tasty I had to ask the waiter what brand it was   He said the name is  Atomic  available on Amazon if your interested   It s so powerful you need to watch how much you put on   it ll clear your sinuses to say the least   Definitely makes the oysters   One small complaint is that there is no entrance to the restaurant that is connected to the lobby of the ARIA   There are faux windows that open up to the lobby but you can t actually get inside unless you leave the lobby and go next door   Not a big deal but it would be a nice addition and a little less confusing ,4,2016-09-11
nickel beer tuesdays from       pm  go figure the type of crowd todd english attracts during these   hours  egh   but i can t complain for  cents a pop    would love to come back for a meal sometime and re rate    a ok  so far todd english  ,3,2010-08-11
Good place for a Bloody Mary  food  or just a break from the Vegas madness  Depending on what you order it can be pricey  but it s Vegas ,4,2016-04-08
Went to dinner here with a friend our first night of a Las Vegas weekend   I was disappointed   The hostess and waitress were very friendly and the service was good   The food  however  was not   My salad had so much dressing on it I could hardly taste anything else   And while the bacon on my B L T  slider was good  the bread was hard  cold  and dry    making it nearly impossible to eat until I deconstructed it and just ate the inside of the sandwich   Rather unacceptable for the price ,2,2011-09-22
Went here to have some lunch and finish watching football last Sunday  Service was poor    waited    minutes after being seated  My wife  left and came back with the manager  Our server cut them off and said   I m ready to take your order     Should have left then  Food is OK  service is     ridiculous,1,2011-11-22
We have been to this restaurant several times over the past few years  This was by far and away the worst experience  First of all  they were out of several of the items but didn t mention that until we begin ordering  The substitutions for the items were not even close  For example the tomato and cheese salad was substituted with grapefruit after they were out of the tomatoes  cheese and dressing  Unbelievable  The sliders were very dry and we asked for them to not put on thousand Island dressing which they did anyways  The wings were extremely vinegary and had way too much sauce and less you like wearing your food   Mr  English needs to come in and do a serious check up on this restaurant  We won t probably come back and wouldn t recommend it to anyone as there are many better places around which is sad considering they have so many good beers,1,2016-02-27
The best dining experience I ve had as of yet  in Las Vegas   Food was on point and service was over the top  We stopped in for a late lunch early dinner happy hour  They weren t busy on a Monday at    We sat at a tap table where we had the option of Woodchuck or Mission IPA  The IPA was good  During happy hour  whatever your pour is     price  We couldn t say no  I m still not sure if that was a good decision    The waitress totally indulged us and let us have fun  We ordered pretzels  wings     ea on Mondays   oysters on the     shell     during happy hour   and then a burger was ordered as well as some tacos  Wings were notably good  Perfectly done  The burger was spectacular  I only had one bite and I wanted    more  More flavor than any burger we ve had at BURGR  The tacos and oysters were noted as fine by those who ordered them  but nothing to go crazy over  Before tip  everything  including drinks was         One of our group did the pint challenge  Drink a pint in   seconds or less and it s free  A fun little event  They ring a bell in the place if you get it  Well  he got it and got a free beer  Our waitress also gave us to go cup for our tap table after we cashed out  How nice was that   An overall great experience  P U B  will be a regular stop for us in Vegas from now on ,5,2013-09-18
I still think the carved meats with choice of breads is a good option  but on our last visit the turkey was a tad dry and not quite as generous as in past visits  I think the salmon is probably the best call  Also  after a couple of visits with guests  I don t think the menu shines as much away from the carved meat choices  so overall  it is an a ok experience  Definitely a solid place for beer and a high end sandwich ,3,2012-01-28
Every single time I come to town I   Stay at the Aria  And EAT AT TODD ENGLISH PUB  seriously  I love it  Brunch  lunch  dinner whatEVER  they have the right food and drink for any day and time  Friendly service  FAST food and drink  and good music  It s comfortable and relaxed   Good times here ,5,2016-07-12
I went with a party of      of us had the giant  All about Mary  and were very happy   It was brunch and it was filling by itself  none of us finished all of the bits   Bloody Mary was spicy and seemed strong   Others were happy with raw oysters  boozy shake  and sliders     had regular Bloody Mary s and thought they were weak       without reservations we walked up at noon on Sunday and immediately had a table   Excellent friendly service ,5,2017-04-10
I  like to concept of a casual pub  especially in a higher end hotel shopping mall    For my first visit here  my co workers and I came in for lunch and I had the chicken pot pie  I know it is usually better to have more meat or protein in dishes   but there was way too much chicken in this pot pie    My second visit  I had a  variety of  their carved meats  The carved meats were good and they came with more than   sauces as a spread  Part of the carvery meats  you also get rolls  so you can make your own sandwich if that s how you like it    Overall  it s a nice restaurant to get casual food   I am meaning to come back to check out their happy hour         oysters  can t beat that ,3,2012-10-28
Came here during our annual Christmas vacation and the service and lobster rolls did NOT disappoint  We forgot to have dessert  maybe too many oysters on happy hour  BUT we love this place and the staff is so awesome  on our list for must stop in Vegas ,5,2013-01-11
This is only one of two places that I could find craft beer in Las Vegas   It s at a beautiful location    I felt like I was at the airport all over again   Considering we had    people  we had a substantial wait   But the wait and the selection of beer made it go quickly   I didn t venture too far  in terms of food   I ordered the sliders   The meat was delicately cooked  a real medium rare  and the beer super cold   Our server was on it  he didn t miss a thing   I d go back  Definitely   I m a beer snob  I don t like mass produced beer   I wonder if they rotate their beers   Perfect reason to go back ,4,2011-03-05
A yelp and the thinly veiled link to food porn  Look at any number of the pictures that people take of their meal  It s  for all intent and purpose  food porn  We go on and on about how we ate here and what we had like we re bragging about our latest conquest in the bed room     Oh man  you should have seen that plate  man  It was easily a    and I tore it a new one   Yes  you can pretty easily make smut novels if you replace whatever food items in a typical review with gender names and you have yourself a grocery store check out romance novel with Fabio on the cover    So with that  let s talk Dirty   Dirty Chips that is  These things   Oh man  if I had a camera I would tell them nothing as they would already be making love to the camera  Any more dirty and this review would be X rated  But let s go with trying to make the FCC blow up    Let s talk real dirty now   I mean  how can you top this nasty kitten  It s a huge pile of Kettle chips with bacon bits  scallions  blue cheese dressing and deep fried chicken liver pate  If your mouth isn t watering already  I would have to question your manhood    Then you can get really raw   with their extensive raw bar  that is  Though let s be Frank  Sinatra  here  If you are in Vegas  there s a cheaper way to get Shrimp and Crab than getting it at an oyster bar  Stick to those and you should be fine   So what about the lubricant of love  the back bone of any good pub  The beer  It was what I consider a pretty extensive list of beers on tap  Any place that has Fat Tire is a place I will eat in  But they went above and beyond  Blueberry beer  Yes  the Snozberries may taste like snozberries but I do love me the taste of Blueberries  This beer   tasted like Blueberries    The whole joint looks like it could be in some old English novel as the town tavern  but with a slightly more updated way to dimly light an establishment  The bathroom is very dark  They really nailed the whole dingy pub look there better than  say  New York New York did with its squeaky clean NY City streets    Brick stones line the walls and create a look and along with the many hand crank beer handles on the walls and the  flare  of old taverns and pubs  this place has a look that just makes me want to drink some more and enjoy the sights    I didn t even touch on the burger  Now I m not much of a turkey fan  Just doesn t have the same food porn feel  no matter how much you stuff it  that beef does  But the turkey burger with turkey bacon wrapped around it was something out of this world  Oh man  would I like to put that in my mouth over and over again    And with that vivid and oddly perverted description of my food  I ll bid you farewell ,5,2010-03-13
Tasty burger with a great atmosphere  This is a fun Vegas place to eat  Beer pong is also a big bonus ,4,2011-03-21
I went here   times on a   day trip  so yeah  I liked it  The best deal is happy hour     pm every day   half price pints makes them affordable     for St Bernardus on tap    Service is pretty good  but I think it s quicker at the bar  They have a good ambiance  it s usually pretty busy and they have games   stuff  Beer selection is good   they have a lot of taps  seasonals  semi rare beers  at least on tap   Bottled selection isn t as good as the tap  and the bombers are overpriced ,4,2013-08-04
Great service tons of draft beers with servers who know what they are talking about  The oysters are out of this world ,5,2015-12-21
I ve been here a few  times while attending events for work and staying at the Aria next door  I like the beer selection and the bartenders are good  Beer prices are crazy though  Come on      for a Palm  I do realize this is tourist country but so is where I live in Orlando and a Palm here is in the      range  Best time to go is during their happy hours when things are priced at  normal  levels      off   Food was consistently good but also overpriced  Almost     for their PUB Burger   I will say I had my best beer ever here  The Abyss  when I went last year on a recommendation from the staff  Would be a solid   stars if not for the prices ,3,2014-04-02
The food was ok   To be honest if the service hadn t been so bad it probably would have been a    However  he was so bloody miserable if we had not ever darkened his door I would hope that he would have been happier    He couldn t have been any worse  the hostess was very nice and the bartenders seemed great though   I wish we had sat there  Oh well ,2,2014-09-26
Good selection on the food and beer menu  and we had great service  Bar seating is great  Disappointed they only have a bottled sangria  not one that is house made ,4,2017-12-16
Nice ambience and good food  but for a price   I stopped by in need of a liquor mop while waiting for my friends to show up  and had some prawns and oysters  and also the lobster rolls  which were pretty spectacular and chock full of sweet lobster goodness    They also have a really extensive beer list  but      a pint  even for PBR     starts to add up    Still  it s a good place to check out either during happy hour or if you walk away from the Aria tables with a little extra scratch ,3,2012-04-30
i would say its good but not   star amazing   i had the seafood stew   i liked it but it was a little salty for me but it was good   the fatty fries are really good   they remind me of KFC wedges   they had happy hour    wings but it was    per wing and it was small   my friend had the portobello mushroom burger and she was surprised when it came   she expected a mushroom on top of the patty but the mushroom WAS the patty   so the entire burger is a veggie burger ,4,2012-12-06
I am so disappointed with my recent lunch experience here  After passing by it on several trips to Vegas  I was dying to give this place a try  but I never seemed to have enough time to fit in in to my stay  This past weekend  however  I made it a point to finally try it out and I was so extremely disappointed  I wanted to love it  I thought I was going to love it  but it was actually one of the worst dining experiences I ve had in an incredibly long time   We were seated right away at an outside table  which was nice  Our waiter immediately came over to take our drink order  which was also great  except we weren t ready to order  They have a pretty good beer selection so we needed another minute to think it over  That s when it all went down hill  Although he had seemed eager to get our order in when we first sat down  he then seemed to forget about us completely  We had long waits between waiter sightings  and often had to ask other waiters to find ours  He would halfheartedly apologize for a wait  but then disappear all over again  not to be seen until we found someone to track him down  It was crazy  There was a party of   sitting across from us  then a party of    then another party of      so   larger parties all came  ate  and left by the time we had gotten our food  We were just a party of       The food was on the pricier side for what it was  so I was expecting high quality  I ordered the sliders  and was disappointed when I tried them  They weren t bad  they just weren t good  They weren t juicy or flavorful as I had been expecting  I had just recently had some amazing beef sliders in AZ  for half the price  and these didn t even come close  I would say the food was average  and not worth the price tag  The service was beyond terrible  We did more work than our waiter did  having to flag people down and ask them to find him repeatedly  Overall  it was a very disappointing experience and I won t be going back ,1,2014-04-02
Great service  delicious food and tons of beers to choose from  All located conveniently just outside the doors of Aria  When we were there they had a Yelp check in special so be sure to check for that ,5,2015-04-02
It s our third trip here for the lobster rolls   When we booked the stay in Las Vegas  all we could think about was eating at Todd English again   Great experience  Try the pickles   Highly recommend the oysters as well   Another great meal ,5,2016-09-06
This pub is super spacious inside and the chairs are comfy  They have patio seats with a nice view of the city center and Aria  The menu offer big selection       Food Lobster rolls         Omg it was flavorful  tasty and just perfect   Chicken wings           the wings were decent  I definitely want to come back and try the other items ,4,2015-09-26
We stopped at the P U B   what s with the periods   before seeing Viva Elvis at the Aria Hotel and Casino  All we wanted was a quick bite to eat   and that s what we got  I had a Cheese Sandwich   which was OK  Nothing to write home about  Others had a bison burger which looked good   but didn t really elicit any response  The beer list is quite extensive   there are even beer cocktails  Naturally the one beer I wanted was out of stock   Service was kind of hit or miss  We had to wait for a table even though there were plenty of tables unoccupied  Our waiter took his sweet time   so we asked for the check the minute the entrees came out   Oh and he wouldn t split the check between more than   people  Really  In this day and age  That alone is a reason not to go back   So basically it fit the bill for a quick bite to eat   but that s not enough to recommend this place ,2,2012-03-11
Todd English P U B  was just what I needed to have an escape from the escape of Vegas   Sometimes  the glitz and the glamor is fun and all  but geez  sometimes a girl just needs a good beer   Thankfully this place is here because as a craft beer lover  I have a refuge from all the cosmos and sparkling champagne   I was quite content in my jeans and t shirt  just being me   The food is very good   Not over the top  but casual food   I had the lamb sandwich from the carvery   It was very tender and the apple chutney and blue cheese fondue made excellent sauce choices   There was a variety of bread to choose from and challah seemed like the best choice   The sweet potato fries were very crisp and hot too   Oh  on a whim I had an oyster shooter   A oyster with cocktail sauce swimming in vodka and a splash of beer sounded like a perfect idea   This place really shines on beer though   Although it is not the ultimate craft beer bar in the world  it is different from all the other bars in Vegas   You can get flights and I was impressed they had cask beer ,4,2011-11-03
Our friends were in town with their   year old son  they chose this place since they have been here and it s family friendly  The munchkin loved the little buckets of popcorn on the table  kudos on the distraction method   I ordered the coco moco for my drink  it was devine  In the distance I swear I could hear James Taylor serenading  Mexico    Really good transporting drinks here   I ordered the duck buns  very good and not heavy  The duck was moist and the buns soft  nothing worse than tough buns      I then ordered the lobster rolls   Que screeching breaks sound clip   riiight Now    So I wasn t sure what to think  I still don t know what to think  Finding amazing lobster rolls outside of New England is not easy and I ll leave it right there  I should have ordered the burger   Other than the lobster roll thing  everything was fantastic  Friends happy  The munchkin happy  Full bellies  Great service  Nice evening ,4,2015-12-07
very cool place to go  lots of beer and full bar to help you forget about your lost wages  the menu is different than most places  but be ready to pay for it But what you do get to eat is top quality  for me i did not like the selection of choices  so other than that its a good place to go for drinks and food ,3,2014-08-14
Tuesday Bites   Flights are amazing  GREAT beer and GREAT food selections and pairings ,5,2014-08-12
I was in charge of picking a place for dinner for our group of   for a recent trip to Vegas and trying to be budget and fun concious for everyone  I decided on this place   I was a bit disconcerted by the either really high or really low reviews on yelp  so I had no idea what to expect coming in   Starting out though  the decor was interesting with a mix of high celining and tile floor brasserie and modern english pub styles   When we arrived we were promptily seated despite not having everyone in our group there   We ordered a few drinks to keep us occupied as we perused the interesting menu   Unfortunately our waiter wasn t quite as attentive as I would ve liked  but I may blame that on some of our group showing up late and maybe he was thinking we d wait for them  Over the night  we did also wait a little longer than usual for drink orders  I had a nice little find in Newcastle s Werewolf though   Foodwise  I was severely disappointed no one at our table wanted the dirty chips  I knew I stood no chance against them alone  so I directed my efforts elsewhere  Oh well    the wife decided to get the ahi poke on wonton chips  which the tuna was nice and fresh but it lacked in seasoning and the wontons were kind of greasy and stale   I also had a taste of someone s pretzel and wit whiz  I would imagine that means it is supposed to have some witbeer in it   The pretzel had a nice chew  but the whiz was pretty bland     Fortunately I ordered the pastrami along with the truffle mayo and blue cheese fondue   The pastrami alone would ve given this place at least a     It is super juicy and tender  not too salty  and just a hint of smoke and spice   The truffle mayo isn t mind blowingly good  but its pretty tasty   The blue cheese fondue was easily forgotten in favor of the mayo   The two slices of thick cut rye were just about right for making   open face sandwiches with just enough extra pastrami to nibble on its own   Despite the make it yourself method  at     this is a pretty good deal considering the quantity and quality   The wife had the BLT sliders  but with my full plate I unfortunately didn t have the desire to try them   After we finished up eating we met up with an even larger group of our friends and the beer chugging  shots  and beer pong commenced   Overall  a pretty good place to start out a night with some tasty  filling food and some drinks that still leaves you some money for the craps table ,3,2011-10-12
Best Vegas happy hour    dollar oysters   dollar wings and   dollar sliders  And all pints are half off   I ll be here from     or    to close for happy house when ever I m in Vegas ,5,2015-03-21
Fun place for lunch or dinner and some beers inside Aria  Cool atmosphere  Good service  Fried pickles were awesome  The rest of the food was good not great  We did enjoy the duck sliders  Prices are very high  but that is sort of expected  Tap pours of low tier beers were up to     but for some reason they had    bottles of North Coast Old Rasputin  So that s what we all ordered  Also     for Orval served surprisingly in an Orval chalice  Fun atmosphere  Tap list had some pretty good things  extensive  with much smaller bottle list ,3,2015-08-26
Great happy hour for oysters and beer  Otherwise over priced  But its a nice place to meet up on the strip and not spend a ton if you go during happy hour  Also they have the beer challenge  so if you re good at chugging and want to feel really uncomfortable for free beer then this is the spot ,4,2014-11-06
Yes  This is a great place for slightly higher quality bar food   The portions are large and the service is great   This was a pre concert spot to satisfy hunger and booze needs and it did the job   A great spot for large groups  I believe happy hour specials as well   Lobster Roll for the win    I highly recommend checking out this spot  you will be happy ,4,2014-02-21
Spectacular   This place has delicious oysters  Fresh and delicous  The beer is amazing  The bartenders were fantastic  The   second challenge is way hard but worth every second ,5,2015-07-19
With so many choices in Vegas this spot distinguishes itself with an impressive beer and scotch selection  The menu is expansive  everything I ve eaten here was delicious and satisfying  it is pricey but thats to be expected    Ambiance is great with high pub seating and a long two sided bar to post up at and watch some football   Ill be coming back here regularly and would recommend it to anyone in the area  ,5,2014-11-16
I had the seare tuna with sake bomb  amazing  the lobster rolls were awesome   and u must try the Dirty Chips  crey crey good,5,2014-01-29
  stars only because they took the dirty chips off the menu   WTF   However  they did make them for us  but couldn t add the chicken livers   damn   Anyway  I ve been here   times  mainly because the beer challenge has become a tradition  Everything I ve had has been outstanding   Brown Butter Lobster Rolls are bomb  Carvery stuff is always tasty  Great oysters   Bartenders are on point and a good draft  beer selection   overpriced  but what do you expect at the Crystals shopping area  Aria  Cosmo    And I m   for   on the beer challenge   I ll be back ,4,2013-03-06
I came here after my friend kept telling me how great everything is  I figured I would order the same entree my friend had previously enjoyed    I ordered the prime rib beef chili to start  which was really good  I also ordered a strawberry milkshake  which seemed to be made of soft serve ice cream  The milk shake was average for       Entree  I got   The New Amsterdam  which even the waitress had recommended  The meat was overcooked and tasted bland  The best part of the burger was the pastrami  Below average burger for      It came with fries  which were also below average   My friend had ordered a pastrami sandwich  which I took a bite out of  As I had mentioned before their pastrami is really good  but the bread wasn t too good   Overall  if you are in Vegas there are so many excellent locations to eat at and there is no reason to waste your time or money in an average restaurant  I would never go again ,3,2010-09-14
We went here for our last dinner in Vegas  It is a nice Pub between ARIA and Crystal s Shopping Center  Atmosphere is very laid back  relaxed  Staff was really friendly  place was nice and clean  I had a great dining experience   I had the Roast Beef Mini Burgers  It was yum  A couple of my friends got the skirt steak  And the popcorn they give you when you first sit down is awesome   lol    I would def go back here and I would recommend this place to anyone I know ,4,2011-08-29
The waitress was great  the hostess was an airhead  The ambience is very cool  The food was decent enough   Good beer  Above all else though  they charge    for a pint of PBR    C mon  even tourists know what a pbr is people   ,2,2011-04-09
Went here today for the first time  I ordered the Bloody Mary and the wilted spinach salad with salmon  The Bloody Mary was tasty but the spinach salad was even better  ,5,2014-09-24
Watching football with my business partner in Vegas and this had much better fare than the Aria bars  Service was average so docked the rating but the burger and fries were huge and delicious  I tried to finish but was overwhelmed  The meat was thick but cooked med well like I asked and veggies fresh  Of course you d expect this from a     burger but still cheap in Vegas ,4,2014-09-21
I ve been here twice  once for lunch and once for dinner  Both times I ate at the bar   The appetizer chili is great   The beer selection and the casual ambiance is great too  I got the fresh carved meat   lamb with a few sauces on the side   The meat was ok  i was expecting it to be more flavorful and moist   The portion  however  was very large  I could not finish it and I got the single portion   The side sauces were just ok     There are other items that look great I still want to try  but the carved meat is their  specialty  which was a little disappointing ,3,2012-06-21
Every time we are in Vegas  we have some beer and food here    watch a game and have a great time  The reason I give the place one star  is because over the past   years  from being packed the place is empty    why  one might ask Menu has been changed and our favorite items are gone    prices went up and that is not a great combo  I have a strong feeling that visit this trip was the last one to the pub     You can y survive in Vegas on hot wings and Cobb salad    ,1,2017-10-05
My family and I were trying to find something to eat for dinner and we came across this place  We didn t know what to expect  except we were REALLY hungry  Here  we thought we d get an  ok  meal but they proved us wrong  My sister and mom shared the salmon and I ordered the Greek salad and it was DELICIOUS  Furthermore  our waitress was so nice and so friendly  I will certainly go here again in the future ,5,2017-07-16
Peel and Eat Shrimp and their Oysters are AMAZING    Haven t had such great luck with service in the dining room but sat at the bar last night and had THE BEST service at the bar with Elanor and Ryan    I always bring people here from out of town because the food is so good  along with the seafood the Steak Frites is delicious   Will for sure be back to sit at the bar with our new friends    ,5,2014-07-27
The food was really good   We came here with a party of   for an early dinner on a Wednesday  and the place was already beginning to get full    They have seating inside and outside    What I suggest    Brown butter lobster rolls    mini lobster rolls  Very good  The lobster was prepared well it was very moist and tender  The roll was very buttery and crispy  It also came with freshly made potato chips    fish and chips  The fish was very flaky  You can pick fatties or skinnies fries    sweet potato fries   pretzel sticks w  cheese   bread pudding  This dessert is a must  It s delicious    Restrooms  They have restrooms for men and women in the restaurant ,4,2010-10-05
Great pub like atmosphere  beer selection is good  great service and average food  A nice change from some of the surrounding restaurants and their stuffiness or lack their of  My husband and I shared the sliders  the lobster rolls and some fries   The lobster rolls were suggested to us by the hostess   Looking back  I feel that it may have been simply because it was one of the more expensive things on the menu   Either way  I bought it  she won   The sliders were average  slightly dry and non impressive   The lobster rolls  also sliders  were good  not great  just good   The lobster chunks were good sized but the sauce wasn t super great   The lobster rolls were served on small  dinner sized rolls and topped with a butter  aioli sauce   Good  just not great  We sat in the bar area at a low top table   Service was very attentive  never had an empty drink  all without being pushy or smothering  Next time I m in town  I will most definitely be back ,4,2012-07-04
The atmosphere is really nice and the staff was friendly  also they have a pretty good selection of beer   I m giving them three stars for two major reasons     Their beer prices are outrages for what they re offering  I get charging         a pint for a small batch sour or specialty ale but these are standard beers that should never be sold that high for a pint      They closed at   pm  My colleague and I arrived for their   pm     Happy Hour  cause that s when they adjust to acceptable prices  and by      pm the last call announcement was made  On the strip I just assume most bars stay open at least till midnight or  am  It was unfortunate ,3,2015-04-07
Considering this is on the strip this isn t a bad option for happy hour  Of course  happy hour just knocks the prices down to where they should be in the first place  Their beer selection is extensive and virtually all of it is on happy hour    I had the sliders and they were really good  I was actually surprised at how they hit the spot  I guess I didn t expect them to be so big  for a slider   The oysters were just okay but I had to try them since it was happy hour    You do have an option to sit outside  which is nice  but there is really no view  It s just for the mere reason of sitting outside ,3,2014-09-29
Fun lively atmosphere with great customer service  I got a free beer for checking in and    oysters can t beat that in Vegas ,5,2015-04-04
My husband literally dragged me here for pickles  Yes  pickles  He has raved about P U B  s pickles for over a year  To shut him up  this was our first dinner while in Las Vegas  I must admit  the Crispy Beer Battered Pickles were pretty darn good    We also shared the P U B  platter  which was an assortment of meats  cheeses  fruits  and MORE pickles  My husband was in heaven  I will say  I preferred Olives  meat cheese board slightly more  I tried a bite of a friend s Brown Butter Lobster Rolls   I could have ate her entire entree  This sandwich is truly gluttonous   rich and flavorful chunks of lobster  I m sure my husband will drag me here again on our next visit   but this time I will willingly go ,4,2016-02-27
First time customers  We were attracted by the patio and stopped for a late lunch  Food was very good  Not cheap but comparable and relevant to excellent location on Strip  Overall service was excellent and staff very friendly including Our hostess Elizabeth but especially our server  Andy ,4,2013-06-20
Very disappointing  We enjoyed Olive and thought we d try this new place and it is no where close to the same quality  Great beer on tap selection but the chicken pot pie was just a step above acceptable with a thick biscuit top rather than the flaky pastry top normally used  The chicken seemed like it was cut months ago and very little vegetables  Not what I expected and apparently the same for others as it was virtually empty on a Friday evening  Wings special appetizer wasn t bad  but the Bleu Cheese dressing was only OK  Go to Olives if you need an English fix ,2,2014-02-01
Went here today for the first time and ordered the Bloody Mary   the wilted spinach salad with salmon    The Bloody Mary was pretty exciting with pickled green beans  salami  lime and stuffed olives  these were my selections there are many more options     The salmon was prepared medium well which was perfectly executed  Great place with good service ,5,2014-06-01
I thought this place was so good the first time I went so I went back the day after  And the second day I was not very happy  They brought out my fish and chips  which by the way were amazing the first day  burnt  and then when i sent them back they brought me out another order of burnt fish and chips     It was my birthday lunch too  So i was not very pleased  They wait staff both days were inattentive and not very knowledgeable  They were nice though   Oysters are good and the fish and chips is good  when its not burnt   Deff a cool pub though  with lots of choices of food to choose from  I would recommend giving it a try ,3,2010-10-30
 Exquisite    That s how our waiter described the Brown Butter Lobster Rolls   He was right on     mini rolls filled with the most succulent blend of lobster   Big  sweet  tasty chunks of lobster   Thinking about it makes my mouth water   Sorry   The sandwiches were served with a kettle of cole slaw and chips   Both were good but paled in comparison to the rolls   My husband had the fish and chips   He ate my lobster rolls and wished he had ordered that too ,4,2011-01-05
I m born and raised in Vegas and tasty pub food is hard to find  Todd English was cool back in the day but honestly just for the nickel beer nights  I was happy when they changed the place and put a new menu and concept together  We had a work function there opening week and it couldn t have gone better  The service was cool and the food was stellar  Fish and chips or the lobster roll were my favorites  Beet salad was great along with all the other items  There is something for everyone and I definitely would recommend it to anyone staying at Aria or any locals  Will be telling all my friends and clients ,5,2018-01-03
Awesome beer challenge and great atmosphere   Games and great crowd  Had it twice  More impressed the first time with service but can t complain to much about my second experience ,4,2014-01-29
Stopped for lunch  Food was good  and   was great for location  Would love to come back and try the seafood  Looked great ,4,2013-07-03
We ve been here for happy hour and for dinner  The happy hour prices are great      off most beers and     off wines by the glass  Wings are    apiece  oysters are    apiece and sliders are    apiece  My favorite dish is the lobster roll plate and my husband likes the wings and oysters  They also have a outdoor patio to relax and have a drink on a nice day ,4,2013-11-07
So happy to have stumbled upon a place that delivers it all  relaxed environment  amazing   knowledgeable staff with amazing customer service  Plus over     craft beers      Thank you Agie for the great service    They truly live up to  A beer drinker s heaven on earth ,5,2017-02-12
We were big fans of Todd English  visiting the restaurant every time we go to Vegas   The bloody mary is a meal to itself   We ve enjoyed their fish and chips  sandwiches  oysters and most especially their lobster roll   But during our most recent trip two weeks ago  we learned that Todd English got greedy with their bottom line   The lobster roll price was raised to     but got stingy with the amount of lobster in their roll   It used to be that the delicious buttery bread had a pocket for the lobster to fill   They changed that  the bread pocket is no more and the lobster just lies on top of the bread   Hopefully  this was just an anomaly and not how the restaurant serves this dish going forward ,2,2017-09-11
I remembered that all the servers seemed to have the English Accent  The beer was good  but the fries were fantastic  This was back when it first opened  but I only started to do this Yelp review ,4,2013-09-25
After hearing about their   second challenge  I had to try this place  For the unfamiliar  Pick any pint of beer under      drink it in under   seconds and it s free  They even have hourglass timers bolted right into the bar   The challenge isn t very difficult  I promptly downed two Guinness in    seconds and then ordered a Tenaya Creek Nutty Brown Ale and chicken wings   Atmosphere is laid back  food is decent  and there is a good selection of beer  This place would be awesome with a live band and a dance floor ,3,2010-08-09
Save your money and more importantly  save your time  We just went this past weekend because we had tickets to Zarkania at Aria  Loud music  lousy service and a ribeye that was tasteless  Our waiter was horrible  We ordered the clams with bacon which were actually excellent and for some reason  a value being that they charge       ea for little neck clams  Our portion had close to    and cost      We should have stopped there   The Briskett was fair  shredded and fatty  Not bad but not good either  Don t use the restroom  They have a common entry for men and women with an annoying attendent hocking toothpicks  perfume  and gum for tips  So tacky  With so many dining options do yourself a favor and go elsewhere ,1,2012-12-12
Nickel PBR night at Todd English P U B  can safely be called the busiest event going on at City Center on a Tuesday night  This should come as no surprise  NICKEL PBR  Need I say more    I went here for dinner and beer with my boyfriend and some friends  I was surprised by their selection of beers  Not quite as large as Yardhouse  but impressive nonetheless  I ordered a Kronenbourg       which is a usual of mine  I had some trouble ordering from the menu because nothing was exactly how I would like it and I prefer not to be one of those  Can I get the bacon cheeseburger  no cheese  no bacon   kind of people  So I got the double cheeseburger  sans the double  The best way to judge a restaurant  particularly a casual restaurant  is to have the burger  If they can make a good burger  then I can confidently order from the rest of the menu  P U B  did not disappoint  The burger was delicious  seasoned properly and cooked to perfection  Despite being over sized  the bun was awesome  To top it all off  the seasoned skinny fries were fantastic    Once the beer  burger  and fries were gone  it was time  Bring on the PBR  Let s just say  you get what you pay for  Who says you can t buy anything for a nickel anymore  One nickel can buy you a plastic cup filled with the beer that has been an American icon and beloved by Midwesterners for decades  May not have lived up to my Kronenbourg       but it made for good times    Overall  I enjoyed the experience at Todd English P U B  The prices were typical Las Vegas Strip prices and apparently low for City Center  The staff still had that  I don t know what I am doing  attitude  but our waiter was decent  I can t say that you ll be able to find me there every Tuesday night  but I m sure that was not my last visit  If you want some slightly overpriced  slightly better than expected burgers  and nickel PBR  Todd English P U B  is what you want ,3,2010-05-26
We stopped in for lunch here and had an amazing service and great food   The bar staff was fantastic   prompt and friendly service   Shawna and the woman with the accent made great pairing recommendations for the delicious lobster roll and shep pie    Prices were reasonable   company was great  We will be back ,5,2017-02-17
I ate lunch here with my family on Saturday  It is mediocre at best  The atmosphere is    pubby   obviously which was fine    but the food was blaaahh    I ordered the roast beef sliders which were dry and boring  I ate   of the      and that was only because i doused them in mustard  The fries and the pickles were good  but i expect a little more from T E  No one in my group claimed their meal was excellent    If you re in the new mall you re better off   Wolfgang or Social house for lunch  ,2,2011-05-04
Fun P U B    Dropped in without a reservation for a late lunch   Great atmosphere  wonderful service  super modernized pub fare   Will definitely be back       dozen of their freshly juicy  and tasty shucked oysters  west and east coasts   the dips Bloody Mary cocktail sauce  horseradish  champagne mignonette heightened the oysters   Iceberg Salad  crispy and cold   love their bacon vinaigrette enhancing the blue cheese dressing   nice bits of egg  avocado  tomatoes and bacon   Fish an Chips   wow     pieces of incredible beer fluffy battered fish   crunchy   moist   the mint pea slaw  their house made tarter sauce  and chips were outstanding in accompanying the dish   All these years  staying at Aria and shopping at Crystals and being a fan of Todd English s establishments  you d think I would have tried here before   Well  time won t be wasted  I will return before long   ha   Cheers ,4,2016-12-17
The food gets expensive here quickly  but the service is flat out outstanding  This became our favorite place to hang out in Vegas because it was so comfortable  Good beer specials if you like IPAs  Wine Wednesday is a great deal  But I keep coming back to how well our servers and bartenders treated us when we came in  They re friendly and they care ,5,2013-02-09
After walking around  we were pretty hot and tired and decided to try this pub that happened to be nearby   Fortunately  it was happy hour     When Todd s says    Sliders  they really mean    for one Slider   One   little   burger   What a deal   And  when Todd s says    for wings  they really mean    for one wing   One   little   wing   What a steal   On a positive note  the beer and wine was     off   I got drunk on something called  mead  and my mom seemed to enjoy her strawberry whatever beer   In sum  go to Todd s for their selection of alcoholic beverages  but keep in mind that the food is mediocre and overpriced   much like the rest of Las Vegas ,2,2013-04-24
Hubby and I wandered in to P U B  looking for a reasonably priced  casual dinner before a      show  We were in time to catch the end of Happy Hour  so hubby took advantage and ordered oyster shooters and sliders  He said the oysters were great  I ordered a half portion of salmon off the  carvery  menu and a side of sweet potato fries  The salmon came with beautifully crispy skin  served over greens and with   sauces  The maple glaze was amazing  Unfortunately  the salmon filet was completely raw in the center  Our server whisked it away and it was brought back cooked to a perfect medium  the same piece  not a new portion    Which meant the greens were now wilted and a bit soggy   Overall though  a good deal for the price and the quick  friendly service was a plus ,4,2013-08-09
Eleanor the bartender  fuckin  awesome  Period ,5,2013-01-08
Was concerned that we  a group of    couldn t get a reservation when we wanted online on a Monday night  We were looking a reservation around       but all that was available was      or       We choose the time and the place was not nearly full all night  Good beer selection  although they were out of the first   beer we choose  I had the tuna special and it was very good  Service wasn t bad  not the best  but wouldn t prevent me from going back ,3,2015-12-01
Best sweet potato fries and ranch in Vegas  hands down   Stumbled upon this place after wandering around Aria and City Center on our first night in Vegas and the P U B  won over my fiance in a hurry   Came in for some delectable brews and of course  these sweet potato fries   Tried a multiple number of drinks and each one was delicious   The Mead is FANTASTIC    especially for people like me who aren t into hoppy and bitter beers   Also the Strawberry Lambic Mojito is delicious and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants something less brewy and more cocktaily  Oh  but I haven t even told you the best part   LATE NIGHT HAPPY HOUR is the jam   Great drink specials and good deals on appetizers   YES PLEASE    The food is pretty good too   we obviously came back for more than just fries before we left Vegas  very helpful that we were staying at Vdara    Split a chicken sandwich for lunch   definitely splitable for two people without enormous appetites   Topped off with a couple of drinks and we were in business   The Bloody Mary s were all the rage on Saturday afternoon for brunch but I m not a Bloody Mary drinker myself so I passed   I will say though  I wouldn t have another Oyster Shooter there    incredibly disgusting   Washed it down with my Strawberry Lambic Mojito and I was A OK   Love love love and HIGHLY RECOMMEND ,5,2013-02-07
Absolutely the worst   I was very much looking forward to eating at PUB because I have been to Todd s restaurant in New York and it was incredible  This place is poorly managed or not managed  From the moment we arrived there was no hostess to greet us and give us a table I had to ask a busboy if it was ok if we sat at one of their booths  We ordered a veggie burger and a beef sandwich but the waitress didn t seem to know much about the options  We waited for    minutes then asked the waitress what was up with our food  She said she would go ask the kitchen but didn t return for over   minutes  When she returned she said she didn t know what the delay was but offered to cancel our order which we did  AVOID AVOID AVOID  I would not recommend wasting your time here ,1,2017-10-28
After scouring many menus on the internet in anticipation of our trip to Vegas  we decided our first meal would take place at Todd English PUB  We got to the PUB around   to enjoy a late lunch  The restaurant still had a fair amount of energy even though it was about     occupied    Now to the food  We had difficulty deciding on our meal as many items on the menu looked appealing  I opted for the lobster rolls with house made chips and my wife ordered Grichebactom  grilled cheese with brie an bacon  and mac and cheese  The lobster rolls were incredible  A warm buttery roll with the richness of the lobster were a perfect match  My wife s Grichebactom was good  but not great  We couldn t help ourselves and ordered desserts  I took down the bread pudding topped with salted caramel ice cream and caramel sauce while my wife ordered the chocolate cream pie topped with toasted marshmallows  The desserts were definitely a    out of       We were pleased enough with our first meal that we decided to go back for round    I ordered the dirty chips  topped with blue cheese  bacon and fried chicken livers  and duck buns  while the wife ordered the sliders  The dirty chips were amazing  I didn t know what to expect with the fried chicken livers and they were cooked perfectly  This was a delicious combination of salty  creamy  crunch and richness  The duck buns were ok  As I dug into the chips first  the juice from the duck made the buns soggy which was not the greatest mouthfeel   This was not the foods fault  but mine for taking my time  My wife s sliders were tasty  but nothing extraordinary  We opted not to partake in dessert on this visit  I will be visiting the Todd English PUB on my next trip to Vegas ,4,2011-02-21
Absolute a must when visiting  From their Bloody Mary bar to the raw bar  this place is our go to eatery for us ,5,2017-03-10
I strategically planned to come here after    pm b c the beer and wine is half off  Their half off prices translate to  normal  prices because anytime before    pm the prices are  WTF  A     beer  you ve got to be kidding me     My husband and I sat at the bar where he had a few beers and I had a glass of Malbec  The service was great  the beer glasses were chilled and the bar was large with plenty of seating  What more can you ask for from a good pub    I will be putting this little pub on my list of places to revisit when I m back in Vegas     Note  This pub received a   star rating b c I did not try the food and therefore cannot give it   stars  Next time I will have a little grub     and then edit my review ,4,2013-01-23
While staying at Aria we ve come to Todd English twice once for dinner and once for brunch  Service was great both times and the drink selection was huge  The food  however  is so rich  your arteries gotta be vegas millionaires to afford it  My friends all got sandwiches that came with large buckets of fries which were amazing and probably the best part of all the meals  For brunch I got the lobster eggs benny  which was a huge  super sloppy bowl  loaded with an overwhelming amount of beef  why   and a good amount of lobster  I ate all the lobster  which was delicious  and called it quits  The build your own bloody mary selection was great and essentially can be meals in themselves  Over all worth a try  maybe get a salad if you re not into channeling your inner Guy Fieri that day ,4,2014-07-06
It s decent  The food is okay and they have that free PBR chug thing  Get the lobster rolls for sure and try out the PBR challenge  It s essentially a free beer ,3,2013-09-16
Food here was awesome   We ate lunch here twice while on vacation this year   I had the mushroom sope the first lunch  which was awesome and tacos the second day   Everyone with me also enjoyed their meals   The service could be better   But the food was great   We will definitely return next year ,4,2016-04-22
Excellent service and cool atmosphere    Build your own Bloody Mary s to start and self pour beer taps at the table to finish  Food was great and our awesome server Trish hooked us up with to go cups to keep the buzz alive     Food was bar type eats with a gourmet twist  Should have read the reviews first and tried the lobster rolls  Oh well  it s a good excuse to go back   ,5,2013-04-20
I came for dinner before seeing Zarkana at Aria   I had a reservation for      and they promptly took me to a booth for four people   Seeing that there were open chairs at the bar  I asked the woman if I could sit there instead and not take up one of their larger tables   It was OK with her but it was a mistake on my part   Not all the bartenders take orders it appeared and since there was an hour left in Happy Hour  they were quite busy   My space was eventually cleared and I was brought a menu   I also ordered an iced tea   After deciding to get the fish and chips  I waited for several minutes before my bartender came back to take my order   About    minutes later  a runner appeared behind me with my dinner   The chips were very good and the slaw with green peas added had a good flavor   The fish was not impressive at all   It seemed as if they have perfected the farm raised fish for people who don t like fish  battered fish with no fish taste at all  something my wife would like because she doesn t like fish   The tartar sauce was OK but there was too little of it   When it came time for dessert  a different bartender stopped by but he said I had to wait to order and he cleared my area   He asked if I was done with my drink  I wasn t  but he took the glass  dumped it out  and put it in their mini glass washers that was the most interesting thing of the night for me   No one asked if I wanted a refill   I wasn t drinking beer or cocktails so I was merely tasking up a seat at the bar that a drinker could have been   I should have stayed at the four person booth   Eventually  my bartender came back and I ordered the sticky toffee pudding   Again  a    minute wait and a runner was behind me with it   Not stickiness to the toffee and pudding with little flavor   There are so many good toffee puddings in the area I should have just skipped dessert   I paid the bill and made a quick exit from this public urban bar   The place is pricey  the food is very lacking  and the service was awful   Huge fail ,2,2016-02-07
Awesome bar  We came for drinks so I can t comment on food but the service and prices were excellent  We sat at the bar for a while and ordered a few beers  can t go wrong with beers  The ambiance was casual and fun  They have a fun contest where if you drink a glass of beer under   seconds  you get that glass for free  max of   glasses   It was fun watching people attempt this feat  The bartender was really friendly and nice and the prices were reasonable  They have darts that you can play as well but unfortunately  they couldn t find the dart pieces which was a bummer because we wanted to play  It s a fun place to stop by ,4,2013-07-08
 dead  Co workers and I came here for a lunch meeting and it was even better this time around because a co worker knew the manager there and one of the chefs so  we got to samps alot of items   Their nachos were to die for  Literally  There were fried chicken livers with ranch sauce on that sucker  If that doesn t scream delicious then  just stop reading  It s a heart attack waiting to happen but  whatevs    we only live once  right     The fish and chips were ridiculously huge  When they said fish  you got FISH and maybe  the ocean it swam in    Samps d their dessert platter and wow       humungoid peanut butter chocolate cup  red velvet cupcakes  toffee  etc etc etc    SO NOT PUB FOOD    SO DELICIOUS  I swear  this place hasn t disappointed me yet  YAYYYYYY for a place on the strip with reasonably priced food and drinks       ,5,2010-08-15
Oh Vegas how I love thee   We started with complimentary popcorn and a free beer with a Yelp check  in  Score  Gotta love those Yelp freebies  The Junk fries were addictive   enough to serve at least four people  Decided to try some oysters and they were on point  Definitely cold and cleaned properly   For my lunch I chose the brown butter lobster roll  It was perfectly season  buttery and simply delicious    Service was good  nice atmosphere and plenty of brews on tap ,4,2015-06-25
When I worked at City Center  I had far too many energy drinks before my shift  And on an empty stomach  this got me shaky  anxious  and I was absolutely ravenous and I had a strong desire for some delicious food  I ve always wanted to try something at P U B  and a client recommended the Lobster Rolls   At      its the priciest thing on the menu  But as a lover of lobster and everything luxurious  I had to order these  I got them to go so I didn t get the P U B  experience  But the service I received was good  The bartender quickly retrieved my order and had me on my way so I could go back to work to enjoy my meal   Nothing about this dish was healthy  The rich  buttery  flavorful goodness was everything I expected  It was served with a fresh slaw which cut the fattiness of the rolls and fresh kettle chips which were crunchy and absolutely addicting   I would definitely come back  Next time I ll be dining in and getting an ice cold beer to go with it   not during work hours of course     ,4,2011-09-02
Incredibly good happy hour  butcher cut wings for    each  six is a lot for one person   and all the beers are half off  The beer menu is impressive  with some wonderful Belgian ales  And oysters are    all day long ,4,2016-07-02
The food was awesome   It is pricey but worth it  Great selection of drinks and food  I took my mom and she loved it   See you all again ,5,2016-12-29
Woah  Okay so it s not called Dirty Chips anymore  but rather a more oh not so scary name aka Junk Chips  which I heartily recommend  Large portions of fried  delicious  OMG THESE ARE SOME DELICIOUS appetizers    Was there for happy hour with our group of friends and boy did we arrive at the right place for some late night dinner  The    Wings     Oysters and    Sliders combined with the half off beer and wine is such a steal for what you get on the strip  Great beer selection and the wine list isn t bad at all    Wings were amazing  but spicy  which of course is a must   Oysters looked fresh and probably tasted like heaven  Must be   Sliders  Small but man they pack a lot of flavor   Lobster Roll  GOODNESS I would totally get this when I come back  I had sample of my friends and suddenly was regretting ordering so many wings and sliders     Will repeat my visit here again  Definitely   Keep it up Todd English PUB ,4,2015-01-14
My wife and I ate there last Saturday   We were pressed for time and they got us in  fed and out just in time to make our show   The food was pretty good   I had the carvery chicken and enjoyed it   My wife had the bangers and mash and thought it was just ok ,3,2012-11-01
Todd English s latest is incredible   Great atmosphere  cool bar  outdoor pub tables  red leather booths inside  and our server  Paul  was phenomenal   Expansive bar and a huge selection of beers on tap  including some very enticing samplers   No blue cheese olives for the martinis  bummer  since that s a signature drink at Olives    Prices are high  as to be expected in City Center   The seafood is the freshest I ve had in all of Vegas  it s flown in every morning   Their live bar comes by the piece  east and west coast oysters and delicious jumbo shrimp cocktail served on a gorgeous platter over ice and garnished with sea plants   The duck buns were incredible  the meat was sweet and tender and the buns were like soft little pillows   I ve been dreaming about these ever since and I plan to come back for them    Lobster rolls were delicious  sweet rolls lightly buttered and grilled  then stuffed with lots of sauteed lobster meat   The coleslaw they were served with was the best I ve had   The moules frites  mussels  came in a rich  delicious curry broth and even the fries were perfect   We also had the pickles  three house made varieties  thought they came with bottled mustard and not stone ground    The smoked salmon quesadilla was incredible  with buttered yukon golds and fried capers   They also do a fabulous bread pudding that is served with fresh whipped cream  salted caramel ice cream  and a delicious toffee sauce   The bread pudding itself was the perfect texture and is one of my favorite desserts in all of Vegas   This place rules  I cant wait to come back and try the carvery menu  chose your meat  sauces and bread   Definitely recommended ,5,2010-09-10
I m not a fan of Vegas buffets  Those glorified  gluttonous grubfests aren t my thing  So on a Sunday morning  we take a stroll to Aria hotel to get to Todd English Pub  This is the perfect place to unwind and or enjoy a sobering brunch    We usually come in around noon ish on Sundays and we ve never had to wait  With the hungover crowds lining up at buffets across the way at  Bellagio or Rio  Todd English has been quite peaceful each time we ve visited  The longest we ve had to wait  for a group of     has been around    minutes   The first thing we usually order is the bucket of Traditional Pickles   definitely wakes up the taste buds  My Vegas trips are not the same without them    My boyfriend has gotten oysters from the Raw Bar and on occasion  an oyster shooter or two   and he s loved it  I can never join in on the shellfish escapades due to my obnoxious seafood allergies  Big booooo s      Because we usually dine with a group  I ve gotten to try a little of everything    Appetizers  I d recommend the Ahi Tuna  Poke   Duck Buns or Caesar Salad  All pretty tasty yet not too rich  Perfect for a first course   Main courses    The Veggie Muffuletta is sooooo tasty and not too overwhelming  If you like sandwiches  or you re veggie  I d definitely recommend it  with EXTRA salsa verde     The Skirt Steak is to die for  You might also want a side of salsa verde sauce to go with it  Perfect flavors for a Vegas brunch    How do you go wrong with sliders  Especially BLT sliders    And those crispy skinny fries  Ahh heaven    You might want to ask for a side of the black truffle mayo to dip those fries in   or maybe that s just me    And if you like a meaty mouthful  o  O   you can always order meat by the pound at their Carvery  Prime beef  corned beef  my favorite   brisket  pastrami   you name it  they ll carve it fresh for you  Pick a choice of bread   sauces and you have yourself a meaty manwich  It s almost too good to be true   They ve also got a hefty collection of beers   beer cocktails  However  I stick to the girly stuff  I ve had their bloody mary s  Bellinis  and their Grow A Pear cocktails   and I m absolutely in love with the latter  Perfect hint of sweetness  Great as dessert actually   As for the vibe  like I said earlier  it s never been busy when we ve gone so I m not sure how it is with crazy crowds   it is a pub  after all  I do love the layout though  it feels open and never congested  the bar is in the middle of the restaurant  like at Yardhouse    I ve enjoyed this restaurant pub each time we ve gone  Todd English Pub has definitely become our Vegas Sunday morning tradition ,4,2012-09-04
I will keep this short    Ate here for lunch  Most of the food was a   but the service was a   hence my   star rating  Got seated right away then we just sat  and sat and sat  They we sat and waited for drinks and then we waited forever for food that all came out at different times  Then we sat about       waiting for our check after we asked our waitress for it    I will most likely not repeat visit this establishment,3,2013-01-22
Not the best fish and chips I ve ever had  but decent  This place gets loud   Packed with men  I d say it was a   to   male to female ratio up in here  I m just sayin  ,3,2011-04-03
I heard a nasty rumor that this place was going to leave  hope that is not true I love eating here  fish and chips is huge and crispy   I drench it in vinegar and dip it in tartar sauce and don t care how much of a mess I make Bangers and mash  again   huge and so is the beer selection  We sat with Lynn at the bar and she is wonderful  Beer pong seems to be a big thing here but I am a gun toting redneck so I drinks just to drink I don t need no damn game  yee haw,4,2015-03-24
Food  OK  Atmosphere  Also OK  Normally this would be a   star review  but it is probably the only spot on the strip with a dog friendly patio  which merits an extra star by proxy because it is very difficult for dogs to write yelp reviews ,4,2013-05-15
The short  Mediocre pub food that you will wait for so long you will grow grey hairs   The long  This wasn t my choice for food and now that I have experienced it I will never let the person who chose it pick again  We had a reservation and still waited close to    mins to be seated and when they sat us the table still had dirty dishes on it  The interior of this place is LOUD which is I assume due to the fact every surface is hard so sound bounces all over  Plus everyone is hammered because well it is Vegas  The menu has some high points and low points  but overall nothing that is just going to wow you  The coolest thing this place has to offer is a make your own bloody Mary option which is kinda neat    Our server had to be the worst I have ever seen as he had   tables and couldn t keep up with that  He had zero menu knowledge and couldn t really make any suggestions  Even if he was new he should have learned a little bit and even faked it  The drinks took close to   mins to get to the table and we had to flag someone down to get them even then  The food took over an hour and nothing was good  Beer battered pickles were limp and soggy  I ordered a simple artisinal hot dog which came on stale bread with watery chili  The other dishes at the table were crab cake sliders which arrived crumbled into pieces  shepherd s pie which might as well have been a hungry man meal  and a brown butter lobster roll with lobster you could have bounced off the floor and hit the ceiling  Even after sending all the food back barely eaten and making a point of telling the server we had issues no attempt to make anything right was done  Do yourself a favor and go eat ANYWHERE else  For the quality and the money I would rather eat at a national chain pub and I hate chain restaurants   What works  A neat idea behind a make your own bloody Mary menu  What to improve  Quality of food  speed of service  customer service,1,2014-06-12
I was here   nights ago  This is the best place to be in Vegas provided you can polish off a pint in less than   seconds   Also  this place had the most beautiful tattooed hipster bar tender in the whole wide room   She wouldn t give me her digits because I was probably too drunk  but she told me to sing my praises to her on yelp   My hipster love rap I wrote for her   Todd English Pub   seconds to chug  Free beer  plus this girl Only seconds to love But I wanted it to last So now I need some help I want more than pan flashes She said   leave it on  Yelp     Now tell me  do you love me   Singing lyrics by Guster Confirmed or Plausible  Look like the Girl Myth Buster  Your hair so silky red My feelings hard now to explain My spidey sense is acting up So please come be my Mary Jane   Not a smoking reference Don t dichotomize like Petty Join my heart breakin  band  Cuz I am  Hipster  ready  You proudly wear your oversized Leopard patterned glasses So here s my love confessional Your test  I hope it passes  Got my heart tickin  like a bomb come diffuse You wear your heart on your sleeve I can see it in your tattoos  I said you were my dream girl Rebuttal with an awkward pose Failed attempted ugly face Flared nostrils on a pretty nose  Double pierced tongue I want to check your teeth for enamel A dental hygienist married  Sith destroyer Mark Hamill  Star crossed lovers  yeah  I could be your Jedi Knight And if you so agreed to it I d use the force like every night  Night time raccoon attack You know I d suck the rabies out Just to kiss your pale skin Let s churn  sun burn babies  out  I m Burning up  I understand  there s prolley not a chance in hell Do me a solid  don t change a bit stay you  you do it so well  Todd English Pub   seconds to chug  Free beer  plus this girl Only seconds to love But I wanted it to last because it felt so right I want more than pan flashes just one more night,5,2012-05-29
    stars  This pub is easy on the eyes  and has TWO happy hours for you to catch      p or   p   a  Somehow  we managed to miss both  Poop   Should you desire one of their infamous bloody marys or bubbly drinks  make sure you seek out the table at the entrance  where a gaggle of young ladies in cowgirl getups will take your order on a checklist and bring your drink s  to your table  You ll have the option to select your liquor  add ins  and appetizer choices  These drinks are not found on the standard menu and are not made at the bar    Displayed out in front of the outside seating area is the ultimate Bloody Mary known as All about Mary  Here s where it gets a little weird  It s like they create a pupu platter of common appetizers  and arrange them above your drink so you get a single serving and taste of each item  One chicken wing  one large cocktail shrimp  one pub slider   you get the idea  It s like lunch in a drink  A genius idea  but with so so execution    The drink took about    minutes to make because the girls had to wait for each food item to arrive from the kitchen before they could go about the tricky business of arranging it in a pint glass  The bloody mary itself was a little warm  and we asked the bartender to refresh it with some extra ice  No fresh cracked pepper in it  so the hubs dressed it up with extra dashes from the pepper shaker  The chicken wing stood out  but the rest of the appetizers were not especially memorable    Waffle fries were as delicious as I expected  When we asked for mayo  our helpful bartender offered two options  standard or black truffle mayo  The latter was very tasty  It went well on the little pub slider that came with the All About Mary    Pricey but an enjoyable experience  If you appreciate clean marble countertops and alternative rock bands like Muse  this might be your kind of place  Maybe you ll witness someone try and succeed at the   second challenge  Cheers ,3,2014-08-11

Located behind the front desk at the Aria Resort   Casino  The Pub is Todd English s take in the gastropub  which seems to be the hot thing in Vegas at the moment  if not the whole country   The establishment is well set up with ample seating inside and outside  with the latter being next to the flower bed and rock sculpture  Inside  there is an enormous bar surrounding a huge wall of alcohol  with drinks  food and other specials listed on blackboards  They also have an hour glass rotator spaced evenly throughout the bar seating  but more on that later    The place has    different types of beer on hand from various regions  including Belgium and the United States  along with Trappist beer made by monks    While there are other locations in Vegas that offer      any beer aficionado will find something they like  However  the star of the show in my opinion is the TE Bloody Mary  It s probably the best BM I ve had in a long time  with a generous amount of spice and kick to really get the senses going  It comes with a variety of accouterments  including pickled carrots  green beans  olives and cheddar cheese  This drink is a nice beverage and meal rolled into one  I would recommend this to anyone stopping by here  it s that good   The food on the other hand is hit or miss  While they claim to have a raw bar  I felt it really missed the mark  with the oysters improperly shucked and not very fresh  It was the biggest disappointment as I am a huge fan and was hoping to have something close to satisfy that craving    I also ordered their hot dog  which was okay  Look wise  it s a beast  at a whopping  foot long  possibly bigger  and more than enough for two people  The dog was split a third of the way down to fill it with cheddar cheese which was a nice touch  The brioche bun also took this American staple to a higher level but that s where it really ends  While the bun was nice and soft  the meat to bread ratio was grossly off  opting for big and large presentations over taste  The sausage also didn t have the kind of snap I was looking for  It may have been different with the chili and onion option but I don t think another    addition to an already expensive meal       was worth it    Not bad by any means but definitely not great    The hour glass at the bar however  is super interesting  especially if you are coming with friends  The   second hour glass challenge allows daredevils to down a beer before the sand runs out  Those that are successful get their beer for free and you can do this twice a day  Pretty sweet for those looking for a raucous good time    Overall  an okay spot but nothing I haven t seen or experienced elsewhere ,3,2014-02-25
Just stopped in for a pint  The bartender was friendly while giving me tastes  but the beer was wildly overpriced   the atmosphere was eclectic almost to the degree of headache inducing  Not a bar for beer lovers ,2,2014-02-25
This place rocks the gastro pub title  It s a little pricey but well worth the extra    I shared a grilled cheese with bacon and tomatoes  It was bomb ,4,2010-08-26
Over a couple visits this past weekend we had the pork sliders  the lobster cobb salad  the beef sliders  fries  steak fries  peach mimosa and a few happy hour beers   Everything was delicious and the service was great   Thanks guys ,5,2015-09-10
This place is the absolute best place  The atmosphere is great  the staff are fun and hilarious  the food sooo good  Love the chicken pot pie  shepherds pie and the fish n chips  The drinks are good and the music is fantastic  All around good experience that you must try in Vegas   ,5,2016-01-31
This place has been a staple for us every time we visit Las Vegas but the last time we were here  the quality of the food has gone down quite a bit   Apparently they have had a change in ownership  according to the staff we talked with  and they have made some not so positive changes   For example  we always get their Brown Butter Lobster Rolls and it used to be amazing   three little rolls filled to the top with REAL lobster meat  claws and all  for only     but now the rolls are barely filled and the meat looks like previously frozen and maybe not even real lobster and to top it off  they raised the price to       I know it s only a dollar more  but to get less to pay more doesn t seem cool   Good thing  Vegas has other numerous choices for foodies   my suggestion is to spend your money elsewhere ,2,2017-05-27
Surprisingly good  after eating at so many lackluster places in City Center  I can finally recommend something here    The dirty nachos were SO good   fried chicken liver  who would ve thought  The pastrami was just as yummy and the black mayo was as delicious as it gets   I m coming back to Aria specifically for Crystals and this place alone ,3,2010-08-23
Went to check out Todd English and checked in through yelp for a free bud light draft beer Ralph the bartender charged me for it anyways     checkyourcheck,3,2013-09-06
Ce here with the intensions of taking a to go with me to the airport but couldn t wait and I m glad I didn t  This lobster roll was AMAZING  As everything on the strip it was a little too expensive       but it was a definite pleasure   I highly recommend it ,4,2015-02-03
The one star is for the lobster rolls  which were quite good  For the rest  I walked away both unhappy and queasy   Start with the beer  we visited PUB right after it opened and left without ordering because they were out of my first three beer picks  Tonight  Same story  Also could not make the first two mixed drinks my husband requested  but finally managed a vodka tonic   I ordered roast beef sliders  The roast beef was just ok  but the bread was dry  hard and cold  I also ordered a side of fries  which were served dead cold  Our server did go and get a new  hot order without argument  then brought me a bottle of ketchup  which you have to ask for because only plebes want ketchup   absolutely crusted with old  hard ketchup   The last straw was the drunk guy who decided to sit at our table for a chat  After I chased him off  the waiter came over and commented on it  After  Thanks  In a     full restaurant  I d love a little more monitoring from staff   I m sorry that I didn t take the time to ask for the manager and complain  but I really wanted to be on vacation  If you re also on vacation  choose NobHill  MGM  or Sensei  Bellagio  or even Todd English Olives  Caesars  for MUCH better food  and the same unexciting beer selection that you eventually discover is available at PUB ,1,2012-02-08
Unfortunately not a great experience  The wait time for our food was over an hour  My fried pickle appetizer took   min  My Tuna burger was a big disappointment and everyone else said their food was good not great  This place used to be one of my favorite places in Vegas   Our waiter apologized profusely saying the kitchen was backed up and many staff members had left the place since they are being bought by MGM,3,2016-11-04
Very bad experience  We sat down at   and had appetizers  Then  the waiter brought our main courses along with the check  he decided no dessert or coffee for us       The meat was overcooked as he never asked us which cooking we wanted and we realized he decided for us which side we would have with our burger as he brought fatty fries which are not our favorites  At the same time  the lights were turned up  by mistake we first thought  but then the TV were turned off and people were cleaning around us  The food was good but we were so turned off but the service and ambiance that we left almost everything on the table     will never go back there again     this is Vegas     do not sit people after   if you them out by         ,1,2016-11-07
Been to Todd English s PUB several times over the past few years  Each time reminded that their version of PUB food is as good as anywhere  Strongly recommend the Pretzel starter  Also recommend any of the meat selections for sandwiches  Pastrami w three mustards and horseradish cream sauce is maybe the best you will see  Service was adequate  We went as a group of     Pot Pie is excellent  Recommend the burgers  Last night was great starters  Shrimp cocktail is great value  Huge beer selection  Good atmosphere  Fun ,5,2014-11-24
Delicious food   Fun atmosphere enjoyed their Friday special   my Bloody Mary      beer flight was under whelming   Would go back ,4,2016-04-10
We had the lobster roll  crispy duck leg  enchilada which were all pretty good   Service was friendly and quick   A good place for a casual and decent meal in Las Vegas which is filled with either extra fancy or junky options ,4,2011-07-01
My husband and I enjoyed this place  I ordered the Lobster roll of course and it was real fresh  I don t like cole slaw at all  but Todd s Cole Slaw is so good   Again fresh   My husband got the happy hour oysters and buffalo wings    He was surprise how everything was so fresh a super good   He got a second round of oysters and wings   Our sever Aaron is so nice and patient with us he gave us great recommendation specially  white wine sangria    So good  ,5,2014-09-08
WTF  Great beers  amazing food  and great ambience  That s it  Eat  feast  and enjoy ,5,2015-07-26
The service was amazing and great happy hour  Oysters were very fresh  The service made the entire experience an  a plus,5,2017-05-10
I ve been curious to try Todd English s food for some time now   and I finally got my chance   After seeing him on the pilot run for Iron Chef America and on Top Chef  I always wanted to see what all the hooplah was about    I have to say   I was impressed     Before coming to this place     it was between Bezo  the Tapas place or this    something about the smell coming from this Pub called to us so here we went hah      And we totally weren t disappointed    loved the sknny fries     burgers were amazing    heck even the pickled vegetables were tasty   who would have thought pickled veggies would be scarfed down in a matter of seconds  P  I ended up ordering the Lobster Rolls with the butter aoli     man soooooo good   Guess it was all that darn butter ha     Oh the servers were quite good looking too    well one of the guys looked like a legal Taylor Lautner lol    our server was this tall lean guy    really pleasant and had great customer service   did I mention he was cute      Anyhoo   I ll stop rambling ha    try this place if you want to see a sports game or just go for a nice relaxing time with good folks    ,4,2011-01-18
Great atmosphere and great food  I will come back her next time I m in Vegas ,4,2012-06-17
I m not sure how you can call your place an English pub when you don t serve English beers  Bud light isn t an English beer  On top of it all the food was just ok  My advice pick another place to eat ,2,2014-06-03
Brunch until  pm is great when you stay up all night gambling    The open egg breakfast sandwich is a great way to start your day    The grapefruit Radler is a nice drink  especially with an extra shot of  vodka    Televisions throughout the restaurant make it a great place to watch your favorite team ,5,2016-01-24
I honestly enjoyed our experience here at Todd English  We went there during lunchtime at a weekday    Blanco Sangria Pitcher for        was fruity and refreshing  YUM    Raw Oysters   Fresh  Lobster Rolls and Chips  So ummmy  Seafood Soup  Kinda Chowder like  Good  Bill total was        Our server Melissa was awesome  We were seated at a quiet corner overlooking the kitchen  It was fun seeing the dynamics of how their kitchen work  We enjoyed our lunch here   or did the Sangria just kick in   ,4,2013-02-01
Lobster Rolls      So good   Fun place to go with a group when you first arrive in Vegas   Make your party compete in the  Down your beer in   seconds  contest   If you do it  your beer is free   Good way to start the trip   Bit of advice    The Bodingtons ale goes down the smoothest   Shhh  that can be your little secret   More advice  get the lobster rolls    and the fried pickles   Mmmmmmm ,4,2012-12-12
This was another stop on our crazy weekend of my cousin s bachelor party    We stumbled  literally  into this place to drink and munch on some tasty noms  I was very happy that we did  This is a restaurant that I will be sure to frequent on future trips to las wages    What I got to quench my thirsts   Any place that serves yards of alcohol  gets two thumbs up from this guy    They have a nice variety of beers and ciders on tap to choose from to fill your yard glass    I chose to go with a cider  I am not too clear on what that particular cider was called but it was fruity with a pear melon flavor    What I shoved in my mouth after   Drunk chips  House made chips  tomato  scallion  blue cheese crumbles  bbq beef ragu  scallion aioli   Do I really need to explain why these were delicious   Sliders  Mini beef burgers  caramelized onion  thousand island dressing  mini brioche  skinny fries  Once again just the discretion alone should get your mouth watering    Great place with great food and atmosphere  I recommend eating outside on their patio if the weather permits ,4,2013-11-28
The food and service were horrible and the restaurant was half empty  I have eaten at other Todd English restaurants and really enjoyed them  so my experience at PUB is even more appalling because of the comparison  The only redeeming features was the extensive selection of draft beers and a great  fun atmosphere ,1,2011-06-13
I only had the Happy Hour here  but it was great  Not actually great  but better than most of what you ll find in this over priced town   Beers at half price were about where they should have been  and the selection of craft brews was good and fresh  The chicken wings were    each and very meaty with a nice hot sauce  The dipping sauce and veggies were lacking  but the wings were good  The oysters were    each  which seems to be regular price  so no great deal  The shells broke off into the oysters a fair bit and the sauce was lacking flavour  but the oysters themselves were decent  If the food was supposed to be crafted by some celebrity chef  there was no mark of it  This was very typical pub food with no frills   Our server was very slow and seemed to approach each table with an apology for something or other  It was a nice day and we were seated on the patio  so I didn t mind waiting too much  Fortunately I knew what I wanted to drink since the server didn t seem to know much about the beer or wine ,4,2014-04-16
Was looking for outdoor food area outside Aria our hotel  The menu sounded good so my husband and I decided to try it  We knew what we wanted so after    minutes when the waiter came back for drink orders we put in our meal orders as well  Drinks were brought out    minutes later but our food we waited for    mins  Just as we were about to leave they came  My husband ordered chicken parmesean sliders and I had a seared salmon salad  His didn t come with fries  apparently it was an appetizer   which is fine  My salad was good till    I found a big grey piece of paper which looked like someones missing meal order or receipt that was mixed in well with the salad covered in dressing    This was after my  nd bite  Waited another    mins till I could flag down the waiter  At this point my husband was finished and I was repulsed and annoyed  The waiter just said sorry in an unconvincing tone and asked me what I wanted him to do  I said we want it off our bill and to pay our bill and leave  Instead he insisted they had another one almost made and would bring out a fresh one      minutes later he showed up with it in a go box   Did not comp our bill for the nasty salad and offered no sort of apology or compensation   We dropped our     and vowed to never return  extremely disappointed  by this dining experience on our vacation ,1,2015-03-15
Busy  loud  and hidden away at the back of Aria  Lively bar crowd mixed with diners of all ages  Good beer and spirits selection  Interesting decor to look at as one waits for food  Service was super friendly and attentive  Try the lobster rolls    worth it    Fresh brown butter slathered lobster on buttery brioche  Wish it came with fries instead of chips  Highly recommended place for lunch  brunch ,4,2017-11-19
My wife and I went here this past weekend   She had the Chicken Pot Pie and it was really good and felt homey   She really liked the pastry on top   I had the Lobster Rolls and have to say they were the best I ever had outside New England   The lobster tasted as fresh as you can get out west   We will be back   Looking at all the food pass by we can t wait to try more ,4,2013-05-28
I came wandering in here drunk and hungry    I left stumbling drunk and not hungry    Todd English P U B  is located inside of the new city center   connected to the Cosmopolitan and Aria casinos   Feeling adventurous  I ordered the double stack beef burger      ounces of pure heart ache   Really   after I ate it  I seriously felt as though my arteries were clogging    To accentuate my artery clogging entr e  I had a drink called Punch Drunk Love   or something to that degree   It was ridiculously strong   so excuse me for being a bit on the hazy side on the details   Overall  it was an alright place to go   i wasn t completely dazzled by it  especially with the prices  but I was glad that they  seated us quickly and had a great overall staff  Bathroom tripped me out though ,3,2011-04-19
My review will strictly be on what I ordered   Lobster Rolls   I honestly got this because apparently this is one of the more popular items   While these were decent  I would not recommend them to anyone ESPECIALLY if you have never had a lobster roll in the past   The lobster they use doesn t have a genuine sweetness to it and they load it with lobster claws  which in my opinion  lacks flavor and texturally is off putting   For what it was it was decent  but being that it was DROWNING in mayo turned me off   Lobster is rich as is  so let the lobster speak for itself   For certain they do not use maine lobster  a more traditional lobster roll approach  because as I mentioned  the sweetness was greatly lacking   Sliders   Definitely get these with the truffle mayo   I do not say this because I am hyped up on truffle  but because I truly enjoy truffle   Unless you don t mind regular ol  thousand island then stick to that   Belgian Beer Flight   loved this  all   were superb and different   Sour beer   I absolutely adore sours and this tasted as if you bit into a sour apple and chased each bite with a nice red   OVERALL   This place scream pub fare and is a great way to escape vegas life   It made me feel like I was back in Cali at a local pub  enjoying some eats and brews with good company   Like I always say  YOU WON T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF ,3,2014-01-09
This place has my personal all time favorite beer on tap   Pyramid s Apricot Ale    which you cannot even buy in the bottle where I live   I was so lost in my beer that nothing else mattered    I remember ordering the pastrami sliders  skinny fries and a side of blue cheese fondue to dip my fries in   The food was decent but I didn t care as long as I had my dear friend apricot ale to hold and sip   I was so sad when it was gone I ordered another one    The place seemed a little over priced but after all this is Vegas ,3,2011-12-09
Love the lobster roll  Reminds me of home  Pittsburgh  Roland s bar and grille       Not only do they carry Lambic here  surprisingly rare in Vegas  but it s also on Tap    Amazing    ,5,2014-03-18
Mediocre and I am being kind  Appetizer chips were burnt  My lobster salad had a lot of lobster but dressing was nothing to write home  Fish and chips had to go back  Batter was not done and when returned tasted too much of vinegar  Way to expensive  I will never go back to another Todd English place  I have tried them for years and the odds are that it is not good ,1,2014-12-03
Walked in here fairly hung over on a Sunday morning after a night of Vegas  We were looking to get some delicious food before hitting the road back to LA and perhaps helping our hangovers    P U B  does seem like the Yard House or something similar   lots of beers  bar type atmosphere  nice and lit up with patio seating if you wish  We sat inside and the first thing we noticed were the humorous placemats that have lots of intersting beer quotes on them    Our service was okay  one of the   things that knocked this down from   stars  The waitress took a LONG time to bring us our beers  my girlfriend ordered a  nd beer during her meal that didn t arrive until she was completely done with it  thus negating the point of a beer  The waitress made no attempt to comp things like bringing out the other kind of tea because they didn t have the one we wanted  or bringing things out late  Although she did apologize    The food itself was amazing  and that s where all   stars come in and then some  We started with the mussel cocktail which comes out with delicious sauces and about    pieces for only   bucks  I ordered from the carvery   lamb  and went with the waitresses  recommendation of sauces   horseradish sour cream and pineapple sauce on pita  It was amazing  paired with sweet potato fries  ask for ranch to dip   My girlfriend got the burger which was really good  my brother went with the grichebachtom which was an interesting twist on a grilled cheese sandwitch that turned out very well    The beer selection was awesome  and so were the cocktails  I forget the name of my cocktail but it was gin  cucumber  st  germain  and a couple of other things  It really hit the spot  and the beers my party ordered did too  however some of them were extremely overpriced in my opinion  Another thing which was priced high was the raw bar with seafood options         per shrimp for a shrimp cocktail  The oysters were delicious but everything else was pretty damn expensive    Overall a great place to go for lunch  expect to drop around     on the entree         a drink  at the least  Minus one star for high prices and not so great service  Four stars for an innovative menu with lots of interesting twists  modern options  and things to try ,4,2010-06-23
My Husband and I went here while in Vegas with family  I m a Sous Chef  huge foodie  and a self proclaimed Confit Whore  All of my food porn fantasies came true here    We started off with a few beers  Fat Tire and  Lindemans Framboise Lambic  Delicious   Appetizer was the Welsh Rarebit  Crispy  cheesy heaven  The perfect size to get our taste buds salivating and geared up for more   Entrees  I ordered the Duck Confit Carver  Rye Bread and horseradish cream and truffle mayo  AMAZING  The little side of pickled veggies helped cut the richness of the duck  which was perfectly tender and moist  My Husband ordered the Brisket Carver and had the blue cheese sauce and house BBQ  both good  We shared the an order of thick cut fries and mac n Cheese  The mac was heavenly  although I feel a little over priced for the portion  the only time I thought this during our entire meal  The fries were good  but not the kind of item I wake up dreaming about  though their Confit and welsh rarebit are   Our server  which I wish I could remember his name  was amazing  Very helpful with explaining menu items and ingredients because I am one of those people who ask  I had my   mm and kept getting up to snap pictures and he was patient enough to wait for me to return to serve us our courses    Overall AMAZING  hence the five star  As a cook I don t make a ton of money so the bill was a little daunting but  I d say worth every penny and will most defiantly go back the next time I m in Vegas  maybe look into any kind of Happy Hour specials ,5,2011-03-02
This place is awesome   There is no way it should only have     stars   Go have some Lobster Rolls and a pint you will not regret it   While there say hi to some of the best peeps you will ever meet  Brandon  Lauren  Elsinore   Dana Rock     See you soon ,5,2013-08-03
Hands down the best pub I have ever been to     I tend to have a problem eating  pub  food because it is heavy and too greasy  but this place has everything   The Shrimp Cocktail was perfect  and I was able to share the Avocado Toast  delicious  and the Beet Salad  amazing   with a friend while my kids shared a Bacon Burger   I stole a bite   My girlfriend ordered the Steak Frittes   It was perfectly cooked and came with fries  thick and really well seasoned  and arugula     I love that there is something for me  something for my kids  and that there is still enough bar   pub food to keep my husband happy  I ll      be back ,5,2018-01-02
Solid beer selection  I d give this a          but the food is severely lacking   I ordered a  deconstructed sandwich  from  The Carvery    which consisted of a handful of  Prime Beef  that was comparable to Arby s quality  two big slices of white bread that may or may not have been taken directly from a bag of wonderbread  btw this choice of bread was recommended by the waitress   along with a piece of iceberg lettuce   a couple tomatoes  onion and some pickled vegetables     All for a mere     dollars  Do yourself a favor and just grab a beer here and eat a  post deconstructed  sandwich at Earl of Sandwich at PH across the street for a quarter of the price    I can t vouch for the rest of the menu but probably won t be back ,2,2013-03-06
What a Magnificent location in the Crystals  absolutely gorgeous   Had the lobster roll as an appetizer and they were incredible   Friend had duck legs  they were dry and i  had the meatloaf and that was very nice   Waiter was over seated and rushed,3,2015-12-20
As if Viva Elvis wasn t bad enough  we had an even worse experience at this retaurant    It started from the moment we sat down  The first thing the server said to us was   you re going to have to wait a little bit  I just got triple sat      mm   not a very good way to start things  not a very welcoming experience  She finally made it to our table after about    minutes and asked us what we would like to start out with  Well  we would have probably known after    minutes but we were never given a menu to figure that out  We finally received a menu and ordered two waters  and some pretzel  bread  The pretzel bread was served with a mustard sauce which my fiance wasn t a fan of she she wanted to ask for some butter  When she asked for butter the waitress responded with   um  i ll see if we have any but i m not really sure if we do   YOU WORK IN A RESTAURANT  I don t know if any restaurants in america exist that don t have butter in their kitchen  After about    minutes she finally brought back this cup filled with butter spiling over the edges and sloppy  I wish I took a picture of this  We finished the pretsel bread  The waitress took our butter and mustard knives off of our dirty plates and set them beside us for our main course  instead of replacing them   Anyways  we finally got to order our main course  Mine was easy  you would think   I ordered sliders and the waitress allowed me to substitute my skinny fries with fat fries  Fiance ordered a turkey sandwich  Waited about    minutes or so for the food  not too bad  My sliders came with skinny fries  not the fat fries  I know  I know  they are just fries  But I m sorry  it was a simple request   So I calmy brought this to their attention and they apologized and went back to get me new fries  When they brought the fries back they brought me      skinny fries      again  Started eating and ran out of ketchup  I waited   and waited   and waited    So I decided to speak to a Manager  Being in the position that I am in  I have the luxury of eating at some of the best restaurants in Las Vegas  This was the worst experience I have ever had  service wise  The food was average  You can t really screw up sliders  My fiance s turkey sandwich was plain  nothing spectatular    As this was a PUB my expectations going in weren t through the roof  but when you put a name like Todd English on your establishment you expect better service    The Manager did comp my meal which was somewhat expected due to the service but they really need to up their service skills  The atomsphere is energetic and I am sure the beer is wonderful  but you can have all the best food in the world and ruin it with one lousy experience ,2,2010-05-03
Great experience at bar  Food was great but bar staff was amazing and made our visit really enjoyable  They were all accommodating  I ordered an off menu cocktail which came out perfect and without making me feel bad for doing it  and friendly   Bartenders were all engaging and sincere  felt like drinking in neighborhood bar   My boyfriend is restaurant manager with     experience and when he is happy with service I know it is good ,5,2017-03-19
The food is pretty good for  bar food   I like the CBLT and fish and chips are standards   large portions  Love the wedge fries and coleslaw  Service definitely needs improvement  If the service was better  I d give a higher ranking  but of all the times I ve come here  I ve never had an attentive server or bartender  I ve left on two occasions because I was ignored at the bar and another time at a table ,3,2015-09-29
First of all  could you make this place more difficult to get to from the strip   Typical English Pub beer selection that you would find in any US English pub   Waitress informed us that they offer the only cask beer in all of Nevada   The free popcorn was a nice touch but my friend said they were stale   I thought they were just fine   Excited to see that they offered a buffalo burger but was disappointed when all I tasted was the blue cheese slathered on it   A previous reviewer on here made the same comment about the cheese I noticed   I will probably go back if I feel the need to trek    plus minutes off of the strip to get there ,2,2011-09-07
Looking for a great place to hang out while your family goes shopping  or gambling  in Vegas  Todd English P U B  is the place   Widest the selection of beers and a good selection of food makes it a great place   Service is quick and attentive too   Will be back ,4,2011-02-18
It s a bit pricy  but can t expect much else around Aria in Las Vegas   I enjoyed the chicken pot pie        not being in the mood for a burger   The filling was just the right texture  rich and creamy without being overly heavy   Chicken inside was perfectly tender and crust was flakey but not dry and thick enough to really get something out of it   Served in a large oval bowl which was more than enough for a meal   Overall  excellently balanced meal to enjoy on a cool evening in the desert with a Belgian beer  or three ,4,2014-01-11
The junk fries and the lobster salad were to die for  Been there twice this trip and they are fantastic  The bad  draft beer is     each ,5,2014-02-02
They have a pretty good beer selection   We also did the    second challenge   drink a pint in seven seconds and get it for free     out of   of us were successful   It was kind of a fun thing to do at the bar   We tried the duck steamed buns and thought they were pretty good  a little too sweet for my liking but good overall   The one thing that I really dislike at places is the bathroom attendants   I can get my own soap and towel and don t need to feel pressured into tipping for those things ,3,2014-10-15
No tomato juice  I am already pissed  Waiter seems to be a bit snobby  My cold cold martini was cool at best    stars so far   glass was not even chilled ugh  waiter way too dismissive for me  raw bar pricey but excellent  Onion rings nice spice but not hot in temperature       They took my fork away  Had to eat delicious pot sticker with a knife  Butter with pretzels sucked  Had to ask for mustard  Now we re talking  Drank my son in laws very good franziskaner from munich  Roast beef sliders and creamed spinach excellent  Chicken Parma sliders missing spice  Skinny fries they re good not excited over the fish and chips  Taste terrible can t eat it  Looked like the blob on a plate  I love fish and chips  I figured they would be safe    I was wrong  Left it on the plate  Beef sliders were better than average but the fries influenced them  Wife s wine was good   Boddington white ale was as wonderful as always  says daughter     wife said we should have gone for Asian food  Seems like bill was forced on us  We called ahead and when they asked we said it WAS a special occasion  Why ask  They did absolutely nothing  Out of   eaters the average raring was      Bill was      tipped         We Wont likely be back  sorry Todd   ,3,2011-10-01
Despite how good the food was  and it was AMAZING  The service was awful  Our waitress wasnt really interested in helping us  She forgot half of one of the orders at our table  it took almost    mins to get water  Then when I ordered a black and tan she brought me a full guiness because the Bass keg was empty and they needed to change it    ummm yea wouldnt you ask before you assume  Not to mention it took forever for her to return with our checks ,3,2011-08-10
Maybe it s because we came in kinda late  but the food was just eh  I had the duck buns and they were pretty salty  not to mention that that they got soggy super fast  The hubs had the burger and it was unremarkable  We did enjoy the soft pretzel appetizer  though   The service was really slow but overall okay ,3,2011-05-11
Great place to drink and watch football  The Aria sports booked fills up fast so we opted to just go here and watch a few games   We ended up spending a majority of the day here  Food is good and on the weekends you have to build your own Bloody Mary    Really nice people behind the bar and good drinks makes a good time ,5,2014-11-25
This was one of the few redeeming points about an otherwise  mediocre stay at Aria   Exceptional service  thank you Tom and Paul    interesting menu and delicious food  all within a super inviting and fantastic space   This is the kind of restaurant you just want to hang out at for hours  and we would have if we hadn t been hungover and on our way to the airport    I kind of want to cry that I didn t allow myself to have a beer  which would have been the only thing to complete my experience  see the  hungover  disclosure above   although I was so swept away by the atmosphere that I ALMOST caved     P U B  had that perfect  hard to find balance between being really fun yet relaxing at the same time   I ll still wish they offered some sort of hot grilled roasted vegetable option with the carvery meats  but overall this place was fantastic   I might even consider returning to Vegas within the next six months now that I know where to find a decent meal ,4,2010-03-26
Come to Vegas on work a few times a year  Also  with the wife a few times  Overall not bad  Like most of Vegas it is on the pricey side for pub food  Even with Happy Hour drink prices are outrageous  Again    We are in Vegas  The wife and I ordered drinks  She ordered a simple bloody mary and I ordered a draft  At the same time we ordered the wings  We ordered the wings extra crispy  Obviously crispy wings take some time to cook  We received our wings and had eaten half of them before my beer came out  In fact we never got the bloody mary  The table next to us ordered   bloody mary type drinks after we did and they received their drinks before ours  We finally flagged down our waitress and said to take the drinks off   I did not take a sip of the beer because we toast and her drink never made it out  and give us the check  The Manager came out and apologized but made a strange statement about how busy they were  I mentioned the other table receiving their drinks and he was at a loss on what to say  Not a very good experience  If you are going to charge those prices the service better be impeccable and having the food come out    minutes before the drinks is absolutely unacceptable  A better choice the next day was The Yard House  Better selection of craft beer and better food ,2,2016-02-09
I always stop by the Todd English PUB   Their corndog app is delicious   The  All American Beer  sampler is really good too   Good location too   Have drinks  food and walk around the Vegas City Center   The only reason I didn t rate them   stars is because they are a bit expensive for a  pub  and the host and waiters don t seem to be working together   we didn t get menus or service until   minutes after we sat down   The waitress arrived and said she didn t know we were in her section ,4,2011-07-21
We were here for the second time the last two days  Samantha our waitress was extremely helpful and accommodating  We asked if something on the menu could be changed for my wife  She happily said she would check with chef  Asked her for suggestions on what beers were good  she advised of some delicious beers  Overall Samantha made us feel valued from the moment we sat down to the moment we left  Please give her a raise as she deserves one   Would recommend the lobster rolls  ahi tuna tar tar and Mac n cheese allllll day long ,5,2014-11-09
We ve been to Pub probably half a dozen times   We recommend it to friends who are in town and they never report back negatively   As many yelpers note  the carved meats are fantastic here   The prime beef with horseradish sauce and blue cheese is my wife s staple order now   It s the best roast beef I ve eaten   I get many things  but the macaroni and cheese is a winner   The lobster rolls are another repeat order for us  and we ve loved them every time   I ve never had anything off of the raw bar  but I ve heard good things   The beer list is expansive and pricey  but it s in the heart of the Strip so that s to be expected   But  there are several options for ordering   Fantastic atmosphere  fun place  and excellent food   Definitely come to Pub ,4,2013-01-15
Best red sangria ever  The oysters are very fresh and the cioppino was outstanding  The frites are worth the calories  ,5,2014-12-31
This was the best beer selection of any place I stopped in Vegas this time around  Unfortunately the craft beers were marked up pretty heavy     for a bud light  Look up the word guffaw  and that is pretty much their pricing   So as I enjoyed my     snifter of Karmeliet waiting for my     ruben to come out  I realized that you should just admit defeat to the tourist trap that is the Las Vegas strip  and not expect anything less than a     check per person meal   The food and beer  even the service and atmosphere here was good  Maybe a bit hard to locate if you re not already in the Aria  but not impossible ,4,2015-08-11
Ordered a Chicken BLT  which was pretty good  although the chicken was a bit overcooked  I sat at the bar and the service was great and super fast ,4,2014-09-30
Came here Sunday  late night  Their yelp says they are open until   AM  We walk in  we get stopped by the bartender saying cut off is   am and he shrugged us off when we brought up their Yelp time of  am closing  Rude  unprofessional  get your act together  The food looks mediocre anyways  you re better of going to Denny s  if you re going to go goblin GMO might as well skip the over priced pub here ,1,2015-12-28
Nicole is the most amazing bartender  She knows more about beer than you could possibly imagine  and will go to great lengths for you to enjoy them as much as she does  Great personality and great at alleviating the pain of a brutal hangover    oh  and the food is amazing  Chicken parm sliders and the most extreme Bloody Mary bar in Vegas ,5,2013-10-20
I gave PUB   stars because the food was upscale casual without being fussy  our server was super friendly and fun  and the beer list is outstanding   including a nice fruity pear bear that I love   Also had Firestone  which is where our friend works   I had the chicken pot pie  despite my lactose intolerance   It was super delicious   my husband ended up eating half of it   big portions  succulently roasted chicken  vegetables  a nice veloute  and puff pasty   He had a burger and proclaimed it to be tasty   We had the onion ring appetizer  which was really good   The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming  we watched Game   of the World Series  so it s sports lover friendly     The value of the food was good   Vegas strip food is overpriced  but at least here you feel like you got a good meal from it   Laid back  casual  and fun   Highly recommend ,4,2011-10-23
We came here primarily for oysters   beer   we enjoyed both equally   He had a couple of different IPAs while I had the german Grapefruit beer   We also had the fried pickles which had   dipping sauces  our favorite was the bleu cheese fondue   The adult grilled cheese was a delightful combination of bacon   brie   The meatloaf was tasty comfort food at its best   We enjoyed this visit just as much as we did the other half dozen times we ve been here on various trips to Vegas ,4,2016-06-19
The only reason we tried this place was to see if their Fish n Chips were English Pub worthy    Good news  they were actually one of the best we ve had  if you don t agree  you don t like Fish n Chips  stop posing   More good news for me  Lindemann s Framboise on tap    yum        Bad news  seafood cold bar  not so cold      room temperature oysters definitely not good           lb  of Alaskan King Crab legs    pcs  just so so  actually had to ask for melted butter    Service OK  not great  not absolutely terrible unless you consider the fact that there are about    servers working there  most  especially these   guys who were just wandering around aimlessly  talking  hoping not to get caught by the  manager   Someone isn t watching their bottom line      Bad news  here comes the bill    well to be honest we were staying at Aria and it is literally next door  so it was by far the cheapest meal we had during our stay    If you like Fish n Chips  and loads of beer  it s worth a try    BTW  don t order the  yards  of beer  you just look plain stupid trying to drink out of it       awkward ,4,2010-09-17
Stopped in on Saturday night to grab some snacks with a friend    we were seated promptly  the service was fantastic  and the food   I can t stop thinking about  As many of the reviews have said the lobster rolls are to die for  Anyone who says differently apparently doesn t have much of a pallete  Don t get the homemade chips with blue cheese and bbq sauce  because you won t stop eating them  They are tangy and sharp and you won t want them to end  Quality ingredients on all that was ordered which included sliders and clams  I am in Vegas at least four times a year and this will become one of my regulars ,5,2013-05-01
When in Vegas  this pub is our normal eatery  We visit Vegas at least   times a year  Service is good not great  but food   beer selections are outstanding    This visit at brunch time  its Vegas Breakfast time  I had the chilaquiles  with delicious season shredded chicken  crispy tortilla chips cover with a flavorful but not too hot red sauce and topped with cheesy goodness and two fried eggs cook to perfection   I also enjoyed a Bloody Mary with habanero infused volka  boy was it hot  yet so yummy and fitting for the moment  The hubby had fish and chips  a pub favorite  it also came with a side of coleslaw  He also enjoyed a regular Bloody Mary ,4,2015-02-21
This was an excellent lunch  At our table several dishes were sampled and all with rave reviews  Great service  very good food  The pretzels were awesome  trust me  Also very positive reviews on lobster roll  bangers  and mash  and the workman s grilled cheese  Skinny fries were outstanding  Yum ,4,2014-08-01
Stopped by for a late dinner for the first time last week and overall I kinda expected more from the place  The place itself looks great  big open restaurant with alot of beers on tap  great vibe and the service was on point  I remember PUB used to be popular for nickel beers but they discontinued it as the place probably became a mad house    I describe their menu as high end bar food with a British twist  The beer tap selection is what definitely makes it worth coming in along with a decent happy hour  My cousin ordered from their carved meat menu which comes with a couple slices of a selected meat  some bread and a choice of side  The turkey he ordered was pretty dry and I thought the portions were surprisingly small  For the     they charged him I thought he would have been better off ordering a regular dish  I saw some of the other diners order from the carved meat menu and their food looked equally mediocre   I got the chicken parm sliders and had no qualms  Nice fluffy bread  perfect amount of sauce and cheese and chicken was great    The bread pudding for desert was pretty meh   I forgot to realize that it came packed with raisins which I can t stand but thats my fault for not anticipating it  The whole thing seemed to be soaked with rum which kinda gave it an odd flavor However  It s totally Todd English s fault for giving such a tiny scoop of ice cream along with a large serving of the bread pudding  I guess its a pet peeve of mine when restaurants don t serve certain dishes in proper proportions  this   clearly needed to be in a     ratio  but the captain crunch cereal pieces were pretty cool   Ultimately the food is good but not great  PUB is great for the brews and a snack but their are more worthy places in City Center for dinner ,3,2013-08-09
We ate lunch here on our last day since it was in our hotel   The    oysters were a great deal   really good  We split a roasted turkey sandwich from the  carvery  section  It was hands down one of the best sandwiches I ve ever eaten  The turkey was absolutely delicious    I d give this place more stars if it weren t for the service  We sat outside   had   different waiters during our    minute lunch  It was a little bizarre  We also ordered sweet potato fries that were unfortunately forgotten about    Prices were very reasonable   I d probably come back if I stayed in the area again ,3,2011-10-16
Been here several times  I must say that I really do love this place  Although I am currently on a sobriety fix through August  this is a great place to throw back several beers and be amongst the best of friends  or strangers you just met    Beer selection is VERY good  Lot s of great imports and craft beers  Also you have your usual more well known American counterparts like PBR  Tuesday nights from     am you can get PBR in  oz cups for a nickel  Think of all the hijinks that would ensure   I ve never eaten here  Only drank and hungout  Food portions look amazing  and it looks like high quality stuff  My foodie friends and strangers seem to really enjoy it  and I trust their opinions   After all  who doesn t trust a stranger ,5,2010-05-04
I booked a large party here and ended up over seating my party by about     The serving team graciously accommodated us and expertly served a party of       rotating guests  We had a great time at Todd English and will be back again  Great food and great drinks ,5,2016-04-19
    for a pint of whatever Rogue beer is on tap   Go screw yourself Todd English  That s a          markup for a beer  Ooh how about    for a Bud Light  WTF ,1,2015-02-08
This review does not apply to the food  which is good   but only to their treatment of their customers  I ve frequented this establishment many times before and always enjoyed being able to watch football  When I came in last night  there were   TV s  one with the game on and the other with the news on  I requested that the other TV be turned to a football game  apparently the manager on duty had a stick up his ass  I m not sure if he doesn t get laid enough or if he s mad that he only makes   k a year  Maybe he s upset that he had to work on a Saturday night rather than spending his night at home with his cat  Instead of accommodating the simple request of a patron  he opted to have both TV s turned off  so that nobody could enjoy any of the games  Upon a second request  it was explained to me that he did not want the TV s on  As somebody working in a hospitality industry  maybe he should familiarize himself with the definition of hospitality  In any case  there are far too many dining options in the great city of Las Vegas and I won t be returning to this one ,1,2016-09-11
update  Shady returned to T E this weekend and overindulged in the chicken parm sliders  A shout out to Mike the bartender for a superb job ,5,2015-08-18
The food was very good  The service was terrible     Waitress was NOT attentive to details  Had to ask for water then waited   minutes for a straw    Asked for lemon and she totally forgot twice    The Aria is an upscale resort and to have a restaurant with such poor customer service was sad  Terrible service   ,3,2017-05-23
My husband and I had a late afternoon lunch here after spending the day riding the Ferris Wheel and gambling in Vegas  and it was good  but could have been a bit better for the cost   We were staying at the Aria  so it was an obvious lunch choice as something different from the Aria Cafe or the Aria buffet   We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess  and greeted by a polite server  who oddly  disappeared in the middle of our meal and was replaced with a nice waitress   It must have been a shift change since were there during the middle of the day  but the swap was never explained to us  which seemed a bit odd   The drinks were good   I had a Moscow Mule while my husband had a craft beer   Both were served cold and within   minutes of being seated   My husband had a burger while I had a light shrimp cocktail   My husband really enjoyed his burger  but the fries were the star of the meal   They were definitely plentiful  and enough to share between the two of us   So delicious   The shrimp cocktail was okay  it didn t taste as fresh as others I have had in Vegas  and for the     price tag  it definitely was on the very steep end considering the portion size and overall quality     We would consider going here again  but I will definitely try another chilled seafood item from the raw menu   which was pretty impressive for a pub specializing in hearty fare   Cheers ,3,2014-11-08
This place was amazing  I m writing this review months after visiting  so I don t remember names or specifics  but they had tons of beers  enough that it was really overwhelming  The bartender was really helpful  I told him some beers that I really like and he recommended some new ones for me to try  Off the top of my head I remember a Firestone      and Squatters IPA that were delicious  When I visit Vegas again I ll definitely drop by ,5,2015-02-11
When did Todd English become the Tommy Hilfiger of food ,2,2013-08-11
We were in town from San Diego and someone recommended The Pub  My husband loves pubs but I typically don t go because I m not a big drinker and I associated pubs with cheap food but my husband pushed for it  It was amazing   It s clear that they put food at the top of their priority  We ended up sharing a couple different appetizers and an entree and everything was presented beautifully and tasted great  I would absolutely go back next time we are in town ,5,2018-01-02
The restaurant is a little pricey but it s Vegas and the burger tasted like a pre frozen patty  The fresh pretzels  fish   chips   lobster roll were awesome  Service was great ,3,2015-12-09
Two words  cast beer   Beer that is conditioned in casks is naturally carbonated  and often has a thicker mouthfeel and flavor   I had the casked Black Butte Porter  and it was amazing   Served at room temperature  and not very carbonated  you could taste all of the fine flavors in this well crafted porter   It was a bad choice for my Tomato and Onion salad with blue cheese dressing  but it was worth it   The beer choices are some of the best on The Strip  and they are the only establishment serving casked beer   I probably would have settled with a   star review  but that fact is pretty impressive    The food was pretty good   I only had that Tomato and onion salad  which is just that   two thick slices of yummy tomato and two slices of onion   It is more of an appetizer than a real salad   I probably wouldn t order that weird thing again  but all of my friends enjoyed their dishes   Most of it was upscale burger and sandwich type things   Ah  and they serve popcorn as a complimentary appetizer      The biggest downside to Todd English is the pricing   It s steep  let s face it   It s also on The Strip  where overpricing is the norm  so Todd s gets a pass   The fact of the matter is for me that this is an establishment aimed at the craft beer drinker  and that alone has won my heart   Cheers  Todd English ,4,2011-11-04
Not impressed  Service was slow and food  was mediocre  Tacos OK  Black Bean  corn and rice had very little corn and black beans  Only positive was I get to sit outside on a nice  sunny  day ,3,2013-02-28
Amazing nacho s  Get a shot and stay a while  the bartenders are fast on a busy weekend  We went on the first weekend of March Madness and had a great time  PS the    Second Beer Challenge  is really     seconds ,5,2013-03-29

Service was great and so was the food   I now want to open my own  sliders  restaurant after enjoying the chicken parm sliders   Great selection of beers and several options for tasting flights   Their deserts looked amazing but we didn t save room   Overall  great experience and one of the most reasonably priced meals we ate while in LV ,4,2010-06-30
very vast selection of beer  A   all their food portions are huge  their pot roast pot pie was to die for    all of my friends got their sliders which were superb too  only thing to complain about is the attention of the service which was very inattentive   it s right next to Aria though  so you can go play some slots while your waiting for the food ,3,2011-10-12
The beer flight  I had the Big Boy  was really delicious  including chimay  and was a nice price   I can t give any start for the fish  which was     breading and     actual fish  Fatties  fries were yummy   Good service  nice atmosphere ,3,2010-06-03
Happy Hour is awesome     price drafts  drink a beer within   seconds and it s free  fail it s double so drink fast  my bartenders Lawrence   Kris are amazing  love the hospitality  the energy of this place you can feel it  for food I had    dollar sliders but you can get    wings  great place  great beer  great energy  good food Enjoy   ,5,2015-01-10
A few beers  wings  onion rings and the table favourite Mac   Cheese    you cannot go wrong with this pub   The service was friendly and accommodating  overall a really good spot away from the hustle of the strip ,4,2015-11-28
Know what you are getting into  This place is a gimmick  But that s to be expected when visiting an  English Pub  in a casino  Let s get to the pro s and con s   Pro s  the grilled brie and bacon sandwich was very good  My wife s grilled chicken with avocado sandwich also looked very good  Come to think of it  every meal I saw pass us looked very decent   Con s  No getting around it  the place is supremely over priced  Typical pint is         While drinks are expensive in Vegas  this is at the upper end in terms of cost  Most places in Vegas serve a pint of microbrew for       to        and one place in Palazzo had happy hour pints for         But you are going to a pub with a large selection of beers  so arguably your premium beer price is going towards having that giant beer selection    The service is also leaves a lot to be desired  Our waiter immediately gave us a bad case of the douche chills  I ordered a pint of the cask conditioned black butte porter and my wife ordered a pint of Magic Hat No     After ordering  he went into this long story about how much he loved Magic Hat No    but wishes he could find it in bottles because in his opinion bottled beer was so much better than draft  According to our waiter  the draft just seemed to  change the flavor of the beer   We thought this was a strange comment because nobody has ever tried to sell me on the idea that bottled beer is better than draft  We didn t think anything of it for the moment   Then after he brings our beers  my wife sips her beer and comments that this beer is way stronger than Magic Hat No     Magic Hat No    is probably a      ABV wheat beer  She then let me sip the beer to confirm  Instead of Magic Hat No     the beer was a Belgian Trippel like Chimay White  Personally  I would prefer the Chimay White to a No     but my wife didn t want to start her lunch with a    ABV beer and wanted something light like the No       When we explained to the waiter that the beer he brought wasn t No     he tried to convince us that we were wrong  If he had left it at that  we wouldn t have really had a problem because  at the end of the day  we are on vacation  and it s just a beer  We can always grab a beer somewhere else  He then tries to convince that it s the draft mechanism that has changed the flavor  He says that the previous beer on that same tap was a Cider and that the Cider  residue  combined with the Magic Hat No    changed its flavor to a Belgian Trippel  Then he starts smiling and says   see  I told you that the bottles are better than the tap   as if he were bringing his whole bottle full circle with this experience   Bottom line  We left with the impression that this guy knew they were out of Magic Hat No    but assumed we were too stupid to know the difference between No    and a Belgian Trippel    Bottom line  my lunch was good  but the service was kind of weird  And it s a little bit cheesy  but that is to be expected in Vegas  For the money  there are better offerings on the strip  I prefer the Public House in the Palazzo  Food there is similar in quality  also kind of expensive   but the drinks are a little cheaper ,2,2013-04-01
Came in for the awesome Bloody Mary s   Staff was awesome but our server Geoff gets extra kudos ,5,2016-10-15
The lobster roll is amazing  The beer selection is great and the fresh oysters are good ,5,2015-02-13
I m fan of Todd English and was super excited to try this place out recently during Thanksgiving holiday  It s located inside the Aria Hotel Casino shopping plaza   Place was bustling for lunch  but surprisingly we were seated quickly  The English pub style atmosphere was very welcoming and cozy   Moment we sat down our waiter greeted us and handed us the menu  Their menu offers an extensive selection pub style food like sandwiches  burgers  fish n chips  hot wings  sliders  salads and other small bites  including raw oyster bar  Average price         on menu items so not cheap  but portions are generous and shareable   We ordered corn beef reuben  ahi poke and lobster roll slider  Everything was fantastic  The lobster roll sliders were outstanding  Three lightly toasted  buttery buns were busting out the seams with good amount of lobster meat and was very tasty  The cole slaw and freshly made kettle chips were great sides and on point   I noticed one of the tables across from me ordered an amazing looking bloody mary called  All About Mary   Wow  It was huge  check out my pic  and I wanted one too  Hefty price tag of      but was amazingly good  The bloody mary was stacked with a beef slider  crispy chicken wing  chilled shrimp  corn dog pup  stuffed olives  celery  carrot  pickled asparagus and choice of vodka  I got the Belvedere vodka with mine and it was refreshing  Meal in a glass and everything was delicious  Definitely not just about the drink  but an experience  Note  Takes about    minute to make   This is my kind of place   good food  great cocktails and perfect pub atmosphere  Plus we had been shopping all morning on Black Friday and were starving  Service was quick and prompt so it surely made an impression on us  They even have a dart board located near our table  Missed the opportunity to play though  So I definitely need to try that next time with pint of beer on my next visit ,4,2016-12-03
no cheap  touristy feel here  Great beer selection and fantastic food in a brasserie atmosphere ,4,2013-05-22

Well this experience couldn t shake a stick to the last one     We went to lunch here b c we were wanted to shop at the largest Louis Vuitton in North America located in the Crystals Mall  It was this place or Wolf Gang Puck s in the center of Crystals   My personal belief is anyone who eats here is either staying at Aria  very high end  or shopping at Crystals  extremely high end  b c the restaurant sits right b w the two locations and there s no real access from the street  so you have to be looking for it to find it   Also  parking is very tricky  there s no lot close to it  so you are forced to walk through the mall or Aria to get to this location   We walked in and it was freezing cold in here  like lower than    degrees b c it was    outside and it was almost unbearable   Strike     Then we got accosted and I mean accosted by the horrible  terrible  kill your puppy and eat it  eh music  It was like Deathstar meets headbanging and it was LOUD so very very LOUD  it hurt my ears  my little brain rattled in my own head   I think maybe the Devil was speaking to me  but I m not exactly sure   Strike     So we mentioned to our waiter  Eric  that the music was pretty bad and very loud  He completely agreed and proceeded to tell us it was the Chef s personal iPod playing   Strike    what manager allows this to happen   The music was so bad we started screaming to one another  b c that s the only way you could hear each other  to name that tune   then Shazam came out   Here s a selection of the music that was being played at a high end restaurant at       am    Barracuda  Heart  I am the highway  Audioslave  wha wha who    The Doors  can do    and STP  Here I come a little much at      am but will work over Marilyn Mansion  we re all stars in the dope show   not kidding       Now  we were probably one of the only tables not dressed in business suits and not over the age of      I can assure you this cannot be the music that a business lunch wants to hear or even notice  b c you could not NOT notice it   Eric did get them to turn it down   which only alleviated the issue slightly    Onto the Food      We ordered the pickle basket for     it was delicious  reminded me of something Carnegie gives you for  free  to start your meal   so keep that in mind    They also brought warm popcorn over which was tasty  so ask for that early  the bar  not our table  had peel and eat peanuts      One lady in our party ordered the Caesar Salad  looked nice  too much dressing  priced at      which is a little steep for a salad at lunch  Thank God we got that awesome music    I ordered the lobster rolls  butter and Aioli on the side  priced at      In the Yelp pix these things look huge  in actuality they are about     inches long and maybe stuffed w      ozs of Lobster meat  thank baby Jesus for the Coleslaw and pickles or else I would ve left hungry   I would not order them again for a meal  maybe a starter if you had   people  They were appetizer size in my opinion  They came w  kettle chips which I let others at the table eat  I also ripped some of the bread away from the sandwich b c the ratio of bread to lobster was like        We also got the lamb carver sandwich with sourdough  horseradish sauce and black truffle mayo  excellent choice  probably the best choice at the table      Lamb was done perfectly  a little on the rare side  and was moist and flavorful   Choices of sauces was excellent as well  It came with pickled cauliflower  gross   I think a better side choice is in order here    Our other co worker  who is preggers  was dying for the foot long hotdog priced at      She ate the whole thing and seemed to enjoy it    So in summation  would I go back  NO I d try something else ,2,2012-12-06
The raw bar smelled amazing when we walked in  Our tab was huge here since we went all out with fried pickles  three entrees and three alcohol shakes  I had fish and chips with the fish cooked nice and sauces were great with it but I wasn t to keen on the onion and pea slaw  Friends had chicken and waffles and bangers and mash which was awesome  Her sausage was great  Fried pickles were ok  had three dipping sauces which were all good  Shakes were yummy but we were so stuffed we couldn t finish them so the mound of food and bill was kinda a mistake  It was fun and this has been on my to go to list for some time ,4,2016-05-19
My Mom was in town for a visit and we decided to partake in some retail therapy at Crystals in City Center  We needed to carb load before burning calories and cash in Louis Vuitton so we ordered salads and sandwiches from Todd English P U B  Delish   The sandwiches are kind of like a build a bear  You choose your bread  your meat  your toppings  etc  We sat outside and the patio area was nice  I would recommend this place for a casual lunch before shopping ,4,2011-02-17
Food was really good  Tuna burger was to die for  Lobster roll and oysters  Was really good  i would recommend this place the only thing why i didn t like about this restaurant was the servers were not good at all  After i told our server my order and i actually wasn t done with the menu she saw that i was still reading it and she grabbed it from me  I told her i wasn t done with the menu  That just didn t make me wanna visit the place again ,4,2014-03-16
Food  excellent Service  excellent Location  Can t be beat Our server was awesome  the food was great   The junk chips huge portion  a       lobster rolls  and brisket plate were all very tasty   Near the entrance of Aria leading to great people watching   Pass on the wings    Not that great and definitely not crispy as advertised   The second day we showed up at  pm it was happy hour      price drafts and    wings and    sliders   We ate it up   At the end of our visit  the sever gave us each a small cup of his favorite brew   Busboy was off the chain good prompting us to tip him as well   You can smell the great management in this place   All in all  it s rather spendy but commensurate with the area   Still a great restaurant with fantastic service ,5,2014-02-07
A large group of us went for reverse happy hour  Most of us were pretty happy with our drinks and meals  I  however  being the only one that ordered oysters on the half shell was not  I had a dozen oysters and      had major shell sand issues inside  I was so disappointed  Luckily I had split an order of sliders with a friend and was able to eat those instead ,3,2014-04-03
The build your own bloody Mary appealed to most in my group and was a nice way to kick off brunch  For      each  expectations were high and they were visually impressive and most liked them minus the beef jerky topper which was chewy and tough  The complimentary popcorn was a nice touch  Overall the food was hit or miss  The open faced egg sandwich was difficult to cut with the knife provided and very bland  The lobster tacos were delicious in fresh square tortillas but we re accompanied by a poorly executed rice  corn and beans mixture  The lobster rolls were overly rich such that you could feel your cholesterol rising with each bite  Fast  efficient service and casual atmosphere ,3,2016-02-21
Came for happy hour  it was great  The server we had  forgot her name  was really attentive and welcoming   Cons  they need to work on their hostesses  The ones working that day seemed uninterested and not friendly welcoming at all      Had the Corn dog puppies  Hot wings  Las Vegas Lager  Moscato  Happy Hour      PM      PM   Close,4,2017-11-24
   for a pint of PBR   Gimme a break   The food is average but they charge a premium because you are in the overbuilt City Center development   My suggestion is to go off the Strip if you want an authentic British pub experience ,2,2011-02-25
TE Public Urban Bar is always a great place to go to when we stay at the Aria  This time we took advantage of the happy hour pricing which is probably more in keeping with most everyone s typical bar prices back home  When you come to visit a resturaunt with a world class chef s name attached to it I wonder why so many are surprised by the prices  Regardless  we had good wine and beers and enjoyed the company of the others around us during the happy hour because that s what you do when you re in Vegas  Sit at the bar  enjoy a game even if you don t really follow the sport and relish the time away from your other reality ,4,2015-10-29
Went here with a group of      Tried the oysters  fried pickles  lobster rolls  and cobb salad and everything was so good and fresh   The lobster rolls are amazing   The bread is so buttery with chunks of lobster   I can t wait to go back for some more ,5,2013-03-11
This is not pub food as you know it  Pastrami so fresh and tender a nice cobb salad with avocado eggs and nice tomatoes The topper is the lobster rolls on fresh hawaiian rolls  This is an awesome dish    Reasonable vegas prices    Dennis our server was extremely knowledgeable and explained every dish in detail   He was great providing great service ,5,2015-10-03
Don t bother eating here  Food is marginal at best  Todd English no longer has anything to do with restaurant  Fish and chips were good  Burger was terrible no lettuce  tomato  or pickles  Nothing  Just cheese  weird   We ordered shrimp as appetizer and found a hair on dish  Menu is very limited since Todd English is out of the picture  Definitely not what it used to be  Beware when reviewing posts from people  Most of the food you see in posts is no longer offered on menu  Dissapointing ,1,2018-01-01
Excellent happy hour and unique menu that is full of surprises    Great appetizers  beer and atmosphere   Chad C  was our professional server  he was extremely helpful with regards to their happy hour options   Chad is an asset to the staff and should be commended for his excellent service ,5,2014-07-11
This is my go to spot every time me and my friends go to Vegas  The atmosphere is great and the food is delicious  Even though the majority of us get the same thing every time we come  which is the LOBSTER ROLLS  Best lobster roll I ve ever had  they aren t stingy with the amount of lobster and the rolls they use are to die for  Warm buttery goodness  I would definitely recommend people to come here and be the judge for themselves and I guarantee you won t be disappointed ,5,2014-03-18
Located on the pathway between Aria and the Crystals shops is Todd English P U B   It has afternoon happy hours and also late night  reverse happy hours which includes appetizers and     well  cocktail beer menu  The food is much better then one would think for being a pub  The environment is exactly what one with think for being a pub  My fianc  and I were starving on a Wednesday afternoon  We were able to walk right in and choose our own seats  We waited about two minutes before our server  Jeannie  greeted us with waters and menus  She seemed to be one of the only servers on the floor so was running all around the place waiting on her tables  Still  we had great service  My fianc  and I split the Cobb salad and the sliders  We waited about    minutes for our food to be delivered  The Cobb salad was delicious  The chicken was fresh  the portion was large  and avocado was perfectly ripe  The salad paired very well with the sliders  There were three sliders and they were delicious  They were only six dollars on the happy hour menu  Altogether  the prices are reasonable here  For our entire lunch with tip and tax included was under      A pleasant Las Vegas dining experience and I recommend this restaurant  Addy approved,3,2017-10-20
Good food and great time  Everyone checked up on us  Mike the manager is hilarious   very cool  Easy place to eat and chill ,5,2015-01-01
Always delicious here  wonderful service from the bartender  very knowledgable on the menu  spectacular happy hour deals ,5,2015-07-27
What an awesome place   They had everything set and ready to go  staff is AMAZING   Beer selection is unbelievable and the food     so awesome and nothing like the usual fare   the Lobster Rolls are addicting   Great party atmosphere but not too crazy    I m hitting the Sunday Brunch next   I hear it s like morning happy hour with a Bloody Mary bar   I m in ,5,2015-08-20
Great gastropub ambiance  Came in for the Happy Hour      off beer and snacks  So this of course peaked our interest     definitely a great choice  Really enjoyed the atmosphere  beer  and snacks ,4,2014-06-30
Located at Crystals  the luxury shopping destination at Aria   it s a cool spot with nice decor and a laid back vibe   It s meant to resemble a New York style pub  There is a large bar and lots of table seating  along with a patio   The service was fast and friendly and my Reuben was really good  A very large portion  but super messy  not a bad thing    Prices are what you would expect on the Strip  on the higher side   If you are staying at Aria and looking for something more laid back and casual  I would definitely suggest Todd English PUB  They also have a pretty awesome beer selection  which includes a   second challenge   if you can chug a pint of beer in   seconds or less  it s free ,4,2015-10-25
In a sea of over the top bars and lounges  Todd English s P U B  is a nice  casual departure       If you are a beer fan  COME HERE  No need to pay    for a Bud Light at the Gold Lounge in Aria  come to P U B  where you can have a   beer flight for only        The bar menu is fantastic too    we had the mini pretzels and the mini parmesan chicken sandwiches   They were great and I suspect whatever we would have ordered would have tasted great   The only issue   We were there around     am  so not ridiculously late by Vegas standards  and on TV they were showing infomercials   Really   As much as I love watching people become transformed by P  X  I d prefer to at least watch ESPN news  and I m a girl   Or maybe just shut the TV s off and make the bar patrons actually talk with one another   Just a thought   I recommend P U B  to anyone at Aria Crystals who wants something lively yet casual   Great people  food  service  and drinks ,4,2010-05-07
I usually try not to eat on the Strip unless it s fine dining or a special occasion at a higher end restaurant   I only came here visiting a friend who lives in the area    This place reminds me of why I don t    Overpriced for not so quality food and iffy service      The only reasons this place gets   stars and not   are the adult milkshake tasted pretty good and the bartender taking care of us was consistently checking on us    The food was terrible just as I remember it to be a few years ago when I went here with my cousin visiting out of town   My meal was flavorless and oil filled    Just gross    My boyfriend asked me if I was sick because he never sees me not eat my meal    Obviously if you re on vacation and don t want to leave this strip this may be a viable option but I would try my luck somewhere else ,2,2017-08-26
OMG  who would ve known that the best lobster rolls are here in Las Vegas   These warm buttered sandwiches are a must have here  You get   small toasted lobster rolls with a side of chips and coleslaw  The filling is mostly clawmeat  not lobster tail   which is just how I like it  In fact  I liked it so much  that I came here two days in a row just to have them    Note that at   pm  they roll out their late night menu  which has a very limited selection and do not have the lobster rolls on it   so go early or be persistent enough and the kitchen will make an exception for you      Other things on the menu I tried were the chicken pot pie  which I wasn t a fan of  The flaky pastry crust just seemed like a croissant sitting on top of the dish and was hard to pull apart   not the kind of pot pies I m used to   Mini corn dog puppies were good  but nothing special  Taste no different than any other corn dogs I ve had  They come with a hefty portion of french fries  so don t make the mistake of ordering another side of fries like we did  The menu is pretty extensive and they serve french fries in two styles  fat and skinny  I prefer mine skinny   ,5,2010-07-15
First off we get there right at time it opens we were seated and got our drinks   We ordered  And waited and waited   Nothing  And waited   Nothing   Finally we flag our waiter down and he s like I m so sorry ill go check   As we look around everyone who came in after us already got their food  No worries they will get it   So we finally get it  It was cold   Like it was sitting out for over    min  our wait time after ordering    So we tell the waiter he apologizes  They bring it back    Still cold  We decide we can t eat this and we ask for the check   The waiter asks us if we are doing good and Howe food was we tell him and he apologizes  The manager comes and apologizes and comps our meal  It looked good but too cold to eat  Maybe we give it another chance one day but not right now ,1,2012-12-09
I must say that I was lured in by a Bloody Mary that just looked too good to be true  It had bacon  a slider  and a full chicken wing on it  Talk about  brunch in a glass    My friend and I sat outside  which is right between the Crystals Shoppes and the Aria  P U B  has a great location  but I must say that the food disappoints  I ordered just a classic breakfast and the quality was only slightly higher than bar food  When compared to price  it seemed astronomical for what I ordered   even when compared to other Vegas restaurants on the strip    I d come back for a drink   but probably not for a meal    The service was great and atmosphere are nice    stars for food quality and price ,3,2016-08-31
I was starving while we were walking around City Center at       am   Most places weren t open yet  but this was so we stopped   just for a snack  not for lunch or dinner   We sat at the bar and were greeted by the bartender right away    We ordered the sliders with fries   These fries are the most amazing fries I have ever tried   I don t know what they do  but they were sooooo good   The slider was good and well cooked  but didn t have anything crazy about them     It is a cool place and a good vibe   a good place to watch football   I would probably go back and try some other stuff next time ,3,2010-11-21
Been here half dozen times    mostly during happy hour  Always great service  Outstanding beer selection  Btw this is a bar review only  Only eaten in restaurant once  Matt was our Bartender   Very attentive and gave me great recommendations  Their  happy hour prices are great  Overpriced drinks become regular price but in the atmosphere of this joint is well worth it  Waiters are awesome  High energy place ,5,2015-07-13
My wife and I were excited to try this place  We were very disappointed  Service  although polite and nice to talk with  was slow and appeared overwhelmed  Tuna burger was recommended and tasteless mush  Lobster roll was flavorless and underwhelming   Roll was just soaked in butter and all you could taste ,2,2015-10-10
I was blown away by the food here  I love all things potato and absolutely loved the skinny fries  with the corn dog appetizer  and I also tried the fatties with the lobster rolls and those were to die for  However  the star of the entire meal was my husband s bologna sandwich  Hands down the best sandwich I ve had in a long time  This will likely be a repeat stop every time we are in Vegas ,5,2015-09-12
My gf s and I wandered here to grab some beers and appies before our flight home  Happy hour is awesome  From  pm  pm you get     priced pints and     priced wines     wings     oysters     sliders  Love the pricing scale   I got the Franizkaner Hefe Weissbie  so yummy  and when I checked into Yelp  got a free Bud Light  We ordered the fried pickles and the half order of the King Crab legs  YUM  Our bartender was super nice and really took care of us      They have buckets of peanuts but a friend was allergic  So they gave us a couple of buckets of popcorn glazed with some blue cheese spice  SO yum  Must try it   ,5,2014-01-27
We ate here twice after discovering it was right outside the door by the check in at Aria  Hubby had been to Todd English Pub in Birmingham recently for a biz trip so knowing they had SCULPIN ON TAP  he was stoked to find that it was so close to our hotel  The wait staff has EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE   For example  I like blue cheese stuffed olives in my dirty on the side martini if I order one at dinner  They don t usually carry them  but our gracious waiter supplied   blue cheese stuffed olives  and   more with some blue cheese so I could make some more   Everything we ordered at both meals was really good  we highly recommend the fresh oysters ,5,2014-06-23
We tend to visit Todd English Pub every time we stay at the Aria or Vdara  The food is Pub style yet of high quality and loaded with flavor  Check in and they reward you with a free beer  We ordered fried pickles to start  It was accompanied by   unique sauces and was very good  For entree we tackled the foot long hotdog  This is a meal and then some and is accompanied by skinny fries  The dog is all beef and full of flavor  The fries are crispy and seasoned perfectly  Service is quick and friendly  This place is a winner by all accounts and should be a part of your next visit to Vegas ,5,2015-08-01
Two of my favorite words are happy hour  Happy hour twice a day every day makes me really happy  Happy hour at Todd English P U B  runs from     pm and then from    pm   midnight    On our first evening in Vegas  my husband and I walked down to this pub for the afternoon early evening happy hour  We found two seats at the bar  and after a slight wait for service  were helped by an incredibly friendly bartender  This place has an incredible beer list  including one of my favorite beers  the Double Jack  We enjoyed our time at P U B  so much that Friday  we returned for the late night happy hour on Saturday with two of our friends  It was much less crowded so getting four seats at the bar was no problem  Again we had super friendly service  much quicker this time too  and our friends were successful in the    Second Challenge   chug a pint of beer in seven seconds or less  so they got their first drinks for free   The only food I tried was the grilled cheese with brie and bacon  The bacon completely overwhelmed the sandwich and there was just too little brie cheese  I wouldn t order it again  but I would go back and try more of the food    I will definitely be back at this place on my next visit to Vegas because of the really good happy hour  Check their FB page for the deals ,4,2013-10-17
Was in Vegas a couple of weeks ago and stayed at Aria   We decided to try Pub since we ve liked Todd English s restaurants before   The restaurant was really noisy and packed for a monday night  but that didn t detract from anything   I started off with a couple of appetizers   First we had the fried oysters with a scallion aioli   The oysters were huge  plump  succulent  and perfectly fried   We also had a mussels appetizer  which was also tasty   For the main course  I had the lobster roll   While tasty  the bread was a little greasy   I also ordered a side of the bubble and squeak   Now  this dish I did not care for   It tasted like it had too much wine in it that was not cooked out  leaving a raw alcohol taste  which was not very palatable ,4,2012-10-31
Livin  The life     At The Pub   Oyster shooters and oysters   delicious  Great bar tender    A must at happy hour     crystals  Las Vegas     ,5,2013-10-26
What a totally cool and hip place with excellent food we found when we tried the Todd English PUB  We were able to secure a booth in the back of the restaurant where we could take in all of the sights and we had a great time and meal  The decor is what you might expect in a pub  complete with dart boards and rich wood furniture  The ceilings are very high so the noise level gets a bit loud  but this is not the romantic dinner spot you were looking for anyway  Yelpers   check in and get a free beer    Even though I was having a martini  I couldn t help but snag this deal up   To be honest  I wasn t expecting as good a meal as we had  the duck rolls appetizer was simply out of this world  see pics attached  and the mad Russian swears that this was the single best Tuna dish she has ever had  That is saying something indeed  It was a perfectly prepared  burger  that she wishes she could have another bite of even as I write this  I had fish and chips that was good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good portion of battered fish   For a bit of fun  in the back they have available some tables for playing various drinking games  we watched several games of  flip cup  and the usual antics of those who have never played     An overall great place to eat drink and hang loose ,4,2013-05-27
Bad service  so so food  The waitress was covered in tattoos and piercings  which always make me lose my appetite  I ordered soup to start  which was delivered without a spoon  It took me five minutes to flag down a service person  who was surly  not apologetic  as he dropped a teaspoon onto the table and vanished  What happened to soup spoons  The chicken dumplings were good  as was the lobster cocktail  The overhead music was too loud ,2,2011-09-30
Location  location  What did you expect located at next to adjacent to Crystals   Pricey drinks  that is what  We stopped in to find out if the FREE BEER check in offer was honored  and yes indeed it was  Score one for P U B   The yelp Gods were in my favor  as I got to choose a draft of my choice   Please and thank you  Most beers are      so I scored a deal  We liked the decor and  the experience at the bar was fine  We heard great things about the food  such as lobster rolls  Next time   Outdoor seating also ,3,2015-04-20
Sorry but the two stars is for the duck buns  A friend of mine recommended this place and I was really hoping I d be bringing the rating UP  rather than down  Very disappointed  These duck buns have way too much hoisin sauce and are too salty with barely any duck for      The Belgian ale they recommend with it is a plus though  Dark and sweet  If you re coming here  the better bet might be the sliders  After all  it is a bar    One plus  their patio is pretty nice if you re looking for a calmer atmosphere  Great for people watching ,2,2014-06-07
We wanted to try a new gastropub in Vegas and wandered into Todd English P U B  We sure glad we did  The bustling and noisy bar atmosphere was perfect for a night cap in Vegas  The studied the menu for a little bit before choosing the lobster rolls and Thai curry mussels to snack on while we sampled the drinks and beers   First up were the lobster rolls and man we re they great and the best I ve ever had  Ive had them a lot of places from seafood restaurants to food trucks that specialize in them  but these were a cut above and second to none  The buttery roll lent itself great to the fresh tasting lobster and just the right amount of mayonnaise   Next up were the Thai curry mussels which had an incredibly tasty borth on the bottom of the bowl which we naturally dipped some bread in after devouring the mussels  They were a little tangy but not part of this dish was too overwhelming    I suppose the beers on tap could have been a little colder but no real complaints here  Definitely going back ,4,2017-05-21
We are here on a conference at Aria and have gone here twice  The service is so so slow and not worth the high prices  Will not return with so many other options ,1,2015-06-14
  stars for the happy hour and cool ambiance   The    wings     oysters     sliders during happy hour brought us here whilest cruising the strip   The outside seating is open and airy with modern decor and a view of the classy Aria to supplement your experience   Indoors  the vibe is more cool and hipster  with massive  yes  much larger than normal  dart boards to entertain   Choose your poison  they re both great   All the happy hour food was delicious and paired well with the huge selection of craft and domestic beers   Keep the men facing away from the TV screens  as their eyes will be glued there otherwise   It is a pub  I suppose      Free Bud Light with Yelp check in ,4,2014-11-25
Came to the pub for happy hour got a server named Chris O took care of us Great service good food no complaints,5,2013-11-28
It s always busy the many times we d come here   Last night was no exception   Since we didn t have reservations  we took the next available seats which were at the bar   My friend got the New Amsterdam which is a burger topped with pastrami  sauerkraut and Swiss cheese   I was full and was too busy watching a basketball game after I claimed my free beer upon check in that I didn t realize my friend had the burger split so we can share fries and a burger   He asked for truffle mayo to dip the fries in and it was great   The best part of the evening was the food came out in no more than    minutes   The friend was going on and on about the food  I didn t touch it except for the fries   I was too focused on the game   He finished my half too   I guess he was saying it was real good   The other times I ve been here  I had the Organic Chicken Pot Pie and Shepherd s Pie   comfort food   Hot  filling and delicious   Angus Sliders were pretty good and juicy   The Corn Dog Puppies come with fries and we order it everytime I m here with my family   But what I always get is their Lobster Rolls with slaw and kettle chips   one of my favorite lobster rolls in Vegas   Nice big chunks of lobster on a buttery toast   Absolutely delish   Of course  it won t be a pub unless they have beer   They have a great selection of beers here   Stella  Carlsberg  Blue Moon  Pabst  Red Stripe  Amstel  Heineken  Bud  etc   They have gluten free beer too   There s one item that I m crushed that they took off the menu called Ninja Snacks   Wontons filled with Nutella and bananas and you dip them in caramel   It was amazing   I guess I d have to copy it and make Ninja Snacks at home ,4,2013-06-19
The lobster rolls were amazing  Their french fries were great too     I am a french fry fiend  they have great deals during their happy hour  They also have fun challenges such as downing a cup of beer in seven seconds or less  free if you can  beer pong and dart games on the weekends  Definitely would come back for the lobster rolls  Their burgers look really big  didn t get a chance to try it though   Maybe next time when I come back,5,2014-12-31
You gotta have the Junk chips  Also bloody Mary bar was the best one I have ever seen  service and atmosphere were great   can t wait to re visit   overall great pull  ,4,2013-09-03
Share your burger   fries     Big portions  Add an egg to your burger to make it that much better  They have a raw oyster bar if your into that  but I say stick to the beer  burgers   fries ,4,2016-09-02
I finally tried the Brown Butter Lobster Roll and the Pastrami  Both are fantastic  The Pastrami is easily the best in Vegas  by a huge margin  I ve been to T E  PUB several times  tried a few different sandwiches  sides  beers  etc  Always great food and great service  I like the music as well   classic rock ,5,2012-08-14
Was in Vegas on business and visited Todd English P U B  as it was right by my hotel  Best tuna burger I ve ever had     I would definitely go back ,4,2013-08-14
Amazing food and atmosphere  Duck buns and poster rolls   change your life  An overwhelmingly awesome beer selection ,5,2014-07-31
Went here for the Bloody Mary drink  Ambiance is just like an English pub  It had a welcoming and cheerful feel   Our server was very sweet  Our order came and the drink was smaller than we thought  It could be our fault for expecting more   It had a small slider  a shrimp  two chicken wings   a tiny corn dog  and some veggies  The Parmesan fries were good  I liked the presentation   The experience was just ok  Not sure I d repeat it ,4,2017-09-08
Came here for lunch as part of our mancation plan to get loaded first thing in the morning   Nothing like a couple pints of strong  belgian beer to start off the day   I had the fish   chips  which was better than your average fish   chips and should satisfy that craving if you were to ever have it   I would ask for skinny fries instead of the ones that usually come w  the order though   I didn t want to order the pastrami or corned beef  because I m such a Langer s homer and nothing could ever compare  but my friends ordered those   things and they were both amazing   Not as good as the     because of the accompaniments  but the pastrami itself was right up there   Service was very friendly and on top of things   I would definitely come here again if I wanted to have a beer in a more casual atmosphere   Oh btw  my friend ended up throwing up on the street  so if you saw a handsome  asian dude bent over a trash can outside of Aria on Saturday  that was my buddy   Good times ,4,2011-05-18
Place is pretty good but expensive  Almost everything on the menu is     bucks or more  Had the lobster rolls which was good  They have lots of beer on tap   Pretty fun crowd  If your only in the crystal palace mall Aria area this is worth the short walk but i wouldn t go out of my way to just come here ,3,2014-01-25
I have been to this pub three times twice in December      and once April          The two times I went in      were fantastic   We were given a basket of what I think were blue cheese flavored popcorn that was sooo good   The first time I ate here was for lunch   I ordered the amazing lobster rolls and my mom ordered the sliders   The second time I was here I had dinner   My mom  dad and I ordered the fish and chips   They were piping hot and delicious   The fish portion was huge and the batter on it was crispy   On this night  they also had a     wine bottle special     When I returned April       I was disappointed with the fish and chips   The batter was soggy and the fish was only lukewarm   I may need to resort back to the lobster rolls     Service all three times were good   Except the last time  we had to flag down our server  who ignored our table because he was working with a large group next to us ,4,2013-06-17
Liked the place  Fish and chips was great  The place has a convinience as its located right next to the Angelika theatre  n since we frequent tht   it becomes easy for us considering tht they hv good food n drink ,3,2015-04-19
We enjoyed the late night happy hour and had some wonderful food   Mini Corn Dogs and Oysters for Rob  we shared Sliders and then I also had the Bangers and Mash because of my heritage  I just had to try their version   The service was EXCELLENT and the atmosphere was jovial but not too loud  weeknight and late at night maybe     We will return   Also check out the water cyclones in the Crystals shopping center  they are a blast ,5,2012-12-14
This place maybe deserves       stars  but I m sticking with   after comparing  it to all the great meals we had and this one stands out as the least favorite   First  it took    minutes to get a menu   What s up with that   Then after we got our menus another    minutes to have our order taken   So after    minutes we weren t expecting our food to come out quickly but it did   The same inconsistency was found with the food   Lobster rolls were delicious and of course expensive  but loaded with lobster   All three in our party were extremely disappointed with the fish and chips  The batter wasn t cooked through and when I asked the waiter about it he said that is the way it s supposed to be   I lived in England on   different occasions    where did this chef get a soggy batter undercooked recipe from   Not GB I can guarantee    Little corn dogs were ok and the fries were just ok   The mini blt sliders were just meh   They looked delicious but needed more mayo or some kind of sauce   Pretty sure I wouldn t come back to this place with the strange service and hit or miss food that is definitely not cheap ,2,2011-05-17
This place is awesome  Food and service is amazing  Beer challenge is a lot of fun  You have   seconds to drink a pint of beer to get a free one  Aggie our bartender was a lot of fun and gave us great service ,5,2017-03-09
Based only on beers  this is the only place in nv that serves cask beer   What a treat   They have a very large selection of craft beers as well as trappist beers  Definately a beer afficionado s heaven  Todd English u continue to impress   Plus you get complementary popcorn ,5,2011-12-17
This experience was horrible  The food was average yet overpriced  The waiter had a rough  pushy attitude  I expected more from a place with Todd English s reputation  We travel a lot and eat at finer restaurants all over the world  roughly  X per week  in SF  LA  NY  LV  London  Paris  etc  and this was amongst the worst ever  Save your money and don t waste your time  This one is a DOG ,1,2014-08-19
I have to give this   stars for the BEST Chili in Las Vegas  and just about anywhere else   but I haven t been to everywhere else yet   oh   but   it s good   reeeeeal good    Matthew at the bar is very friendly and can make a killer Old Fashion  BTW   did I mention the fried oyster appetizer   topped with microgreens with mint too   yum ,5,2012-09-30
Nice food  had the brisket yesterday   duck today   cool atmosphere  When staying at the Aria  this is a casual no brainer ,4,2011-09-12
The server was okay  My brother a burger was over cooked  The fish in the fish   chips was good  Over priced for quality ,3,2014-04-08
Sorry  this review will be pretty narrowly focused  but with good reason   This place makes a slow cooked beef brisket that s perfect   So many places make briskets that are chewy and dry   The brisket here had the tenderness and flavor that only comes with very slow cooking   If you like brisket and you re in LV  go here   Other food was great but a bit heavy   Atmosphere as you d expect  lots of tv s  lots of people   Wait staff was well informed and friendly   Service was prompt  maybe a little too prompt   We got our food very soon after ordering it ,4,2012-12-24
My sister  for whatever reason  loves this place  Every time we re in Vegas she comes here w  her hubby  The food is gross  I could get a better salad at       The burgers are way too big to take a bite out of and there really ain t shit else on the menu  Everything else we tried was either greasy or drier than all hell  They got a good beer selection for a vegas pub  I ll give em that but that s all they get ,3,2011-12-27
They have happy hour on sliders  oysters and buffalo wings  Worth     price  Not easy to find the place  It s tucked away in the corner between Aria and the Crystals shoppe ,3,2017-04-29
I am a huge fan of the beer selection and happy hour  not so much on the food  As a beer aficianado  I was impressed by the choices of beer on the menu  Not an overwhelming list  just a good list  Happy hour makes this one of the most affordable places in Vegas to drink  too  Also  Todd gives away free beer on the   second challenge  He cheats a little by making you start and finish with the glass on the table  which takes a second and a half out of the time  so a     second slam if you can  Good for two free beers a night  Also they have four cask beers on pump  but I was mislead by the menu when it appeared they had a custom bourbon cask beer  when in reality they have a custom bourbon  AND four cask beers but they are unrelated   The rib eye chili was nothing to write home about ,5,2013-04-29
Let me star by saying we had a wounderful table on the patio  A bit hard to find though  Everything I read says its inside the city center mall  Look for it  right next to the Aria valet you will see it  They have a great beer selection and the pastrami on the carvery menu was great as was the truffle mayo for the meal  The wedge salad was great too   Some of the downs  the shepards pie had way to much of a tomato base  It was very dissapointing  Then the worst part    beers    meals  and split a salad          before tip  I feel that is a bit steep  What do all of you out there think ,3,2010-10-05
I liked this place a lot    Lobster roll is fantastic    Best milkshake ever,4,2011-12-29
We had an awesome lunch out in their patio   I ve heard of Todd English but didn t think he was into  pubs      Brooklyn lager    great value   Then we had some lobster rolls    YUM   The crab cake sliders were ok  but would definitely go back for the lobster roll   I know you re probably thinking    lobster at a PUB    But you gotta try it   Besides they have sliders  fries  and all the other standard stuff too ,3,2013-12-27
I was expecting bar food but found myself pleasantly surprised  My bf enjoyed the Tuesday   cent night  While we both enjoyed their popular appetizers like lobster poppie  which was fresh lobster baked ontop flaky pastry dressed Ina Spicey chipotle sauce  I tried some of the chile and it was delish  And the buttery smooth mac   cheese with garlic flavor was one of the best m   c I ve had  Also instead of bread given before meals  lil buckets of popcorn made from a classic popcorn popper was fresh and tasty ,4,2010-10-31
Great selection of beer  Both on tap and bottles  not your average selection   Service great food good also    days in Vegas and I would not hesitate to go back  ,5,2015-06-01
WHATEVER YOU DO  AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE   Really   This is what you call a Strip restaurant   You people are an embarrassment to the culinary arts and service   Please stop wasting peoples time and money    just close    Are your servers trained   Or are they found off the street with merely a pulse   The kid that brought me my food bolted so fast I couldnt even ask for ketchup   What a joke   ,1,2015-07-15
I ve passed this restaurant multiple times over previous Vegas trips and not once I stepped inside it until two weeks ago    This is a surprisingly good casual restaurant in the otherwise heart of Aria casino  I would never expect this casual yet classy restaurant to be here  It reminds me of home and local bars  The food is top notch  I ordered a hot dog and my girl ordered the lobster rolls    It was too much food for the both of us but we still finished it  It was all good    I also ordered a pear cider to wash it down  It still a bit pricey for American food  think Denny s but extremely hgh end quality menu s  but I m glad I gave this a shot ,4,2012-08-30
We love the relaxed yet energetic atmosphere that Todd English s P U B  resonates with us  You feel like you re really in a British pub   huge selections of cold draught beers pair well with Chef Todd English s flavorful takes on some English  classics   British classics such as Bubble and squeak  bangers and mash  pot pies and expertly roasted until tender meats and poultry    Our waitress  Diane V   was friendly  effervescent  and attentive  Our water glasses were routinely filled and beer refills were offered  We re  fans  of Chef English s carvery so this time  it was no different than previous visits  Today  I ordered the   ounce portion of roasted beef brisket that was so tender that you didn t need a knife to cut it  It was seasoned well and you could taste its  beefiness   in a good way  At my urging  my husband ordered the lobster rolls  Oh boy  these lobster rolls were kicked up a version from those that you d find at Bar Harbor  Maine  First of all  the rolls are brioche dough based and secondly  the lobster claw meat is saut ed in browned butter  mixed with seasoned mayonnaise and STUFFED into the rolls  The lobster rolls were complemented with a bag of fresh house made potato chips    As we finished our lunches  we promised ourselves that we will return  again  to this restaurant to try other menu items like the Grichebactom and more beer ,4,2014-05-15
I would have given   stars if it weren t for the oysters   Extremely disappointing  Visually sad  flat  sliced in half    unappetizing  West Coast oysters  Tasteless   depressing  one I would not even eat as it s appearance was scary  Excellent fish   chips   great beer selection  If you re an oyster fan go somewhere else  Service was on point ,3,2017-06-05
Great service    Aggie was a wonderful bartender  very knowledgeable   Will visit bar again next time in Vegas ,5,2017-01-06
Don t have to say anything more than these four words     Brown  Butter  Lobster  Rolls  Absolutely incredible  I ve never eaten that slow in my life  I didn t want it to end ,5,2014-01-27
I normally like Todd English Pub but on this occasion I was not a big fan      First the hostess seats my girlfriend and I in a section that apparently does not have a waitress  After about    minutes we flag down a waitress so we can get some service  It was not her section but she decided to help us anyway which was very nice of her   As we look around we realize we are the only ones with no complimentary popcorn on our table  awesome  Our water comes and there is some kind of metal ring in one of them  awesome  I ordered the brisket which was good and had great sauces on the side  My girl had the Caesars salad  it was so so  Other then a couple things that were kind of annoying  the brisket was good and our waitress was very nice and helpful ,2,2013-11-04
Tasty and fun   You can t get much better than that   Came here before a show on a Friday night around        Wait wasn t bad at all   They have a pretty extensive beer list  but I didn t partake as I was already happy from the happy hour at Comme Ca if you know what I mean   The food was so yummy   I got the shepherds pie and the beef pork ragu was probably one of the best shep pie fillings I ve had   My husband got this pastrami burger that was so big  my TMJ acted up when I took a bite   You know a burger s good when your jaw unhinges trying to get it   The pastrami on that burger was surprisingly very peppery   My brother s girlfriend got the amazing and legend waitforit dary grilled cheese sandwich   It was huge  cheesy  melty  and made with brie   She wolfed that whole thing down and she only weighs like     pounds   The fries  both the skinny and steak cut  were cooked to perfection   Had a great time  but can t give it   stars because of three things      The floor is super slippery and when you have heels on and are a little sloshed  this is not good      There is a bathroom attendant           really   At a pub      The prices are pretty steep for the type of food being served  but  hey  it s the Strip ,4,2012-11-28
So not sure who this Todd English guy is but the Mega Bloody Mary was great  This is what Vegas should be all about  Big  fancy and tasty drinks worth instagram ing  I also frequent his other restaurant  Olives but it s pricey ,4,2017-08-28
Went to the P U B  for lunch and the food is great  It is a little expensive      for a foot long kobe hot dog   but so o worth it  Even the presentation is cute  As people have mentioned  the service is hit or miss  but I did notice the manager hovering around making sure guests were being taken cared of  There is bar seating where you get little pails of peanuts   shells go on the floor vs  the little pail of warm popcorn the tables get  There is a large selection of beers and ciders   a few imported  ie  strongbow  and it is even possible to get a flight of samples  Next time I m in town I m definitely stopping here before my walk through City Center ,4,2010-10-28
Great food  awesome drink list    We had a little bit of everything and nothing was bad ,4,2015-06-27
we made a plan to search out the best lobster roll this week end  And todds english pub was definitely the best  Will return  Loved the informally  If one can drink a pint in   seconds then the next one is on the house   During our    hours there  only one bell donned meaning then someone had  Super fun place ,5,2017-09-03
I don t think I d classify this as a gastro pub   What it is  is an OK pub in an expensive mall location serving OK but expensive fancied up bar food    We tried   Todd English restaurants both were disappointments ,3,2010-09-26
Central meeting spot between Vdara and Aria where our groups were staying  This gastropub sets out spicy popcorn on the tables instead of bread and is pretty open  Nice for our big group of      A little pricey   but it is Vegas  and I felt that my menu options were a bit limited in the way of veggie friendly pescatarian options   My order  Veggie Portatbello Mushroom  burger  on a roll served with bucket of pickled veggies  The portabello mushrooms must have been chopped up and mixed into the spinach as I really didn t see or barely taste them in my sandwich  Perhaps they were buried under the grilled bell peppers and melted cheese but I had to dig deep to find them  The side of pickled veggies was an interesting addition  but I think I would have preferred them unpickled or maybe just a side salad    Their Grow A Pear specialty cocktail was tasty and sweetly refreshing  Grey Goose La Poire Vodka  splash of sour mix  topped with riesling  Made out for        stars for decent food  drinks  and good atmosphere  just was not super impressed but then again its Vegas and anything AMAZING I would expect to pay much more ,3,2010-11-01
We sat in the bar area and just had a quick appetizer before we saw the blue man group  We ordered the wings and they were delicious  Our server was very sweet and attentive  Great experience,5,2017-04-24
The bloody Mary s are amazing  Got to love being able to build your own blood Mary from scratch    Happy hour is awesome      oysters ,4,2014-08-03
I love this place  Such a fun atmosphere  Our go to while in town  Can get a bit pricey but hit it up during happy hour ,4,2015-06-03
Environment is cool  Food is great  Portions could be a bit bigger for the prices though  Grilled cheese sandwich was yum  Sliders were seasoned well but a bit over cooked  They chocolate berries beer cocktail was delish  The sweet potato fries are just like you would get anywhere else  Our friends got items from the carvery part of the menu  They loved it  The dipping sauces those come with where yummy  I dipped my fries in them  I d go again ,4,2011-02-22
Took my parents here on a recent trip to Vegas and they quite liked this fare   Meet   potatoes kind of thing but a little gourmet   I tried the carved meat   it was quite tasty and cooked just right   ie not dry   Close to the Aria in the City Center   The place is quite busy   boisterous ,3,2011-06-20
Stopped by for brunch not ever hearing of this restaurant  Service was amazing  food was delicious  drinks were on point   great atmosphere  We ordered off the brunch menu  loved the open face egg sandwich    and the guys     well they had the All About Mary bloody mary  Will be back ,5,2016-02-29
So  you were on the fence for whether you should book a Thursday night dinner at a fancy place   You already have Friday and Saturday night reservations on the books  and you re planning to splurge on those   You re not sure you really  need  a third      meal for the weekend  and you were apprehensive about having to rush to make it to a Thursday reservation before the restaurant closed   even if your flight was going to be on time          of course  your flight was delayed  though a small part of you is now secretly smug about having not booked your reservation   You re staying at Aria  you re tired  and at this point  you just want some normal food and a beer   It s not excessively late  but a lot of the restaurants are now closed     Sound familiar   Before you grumble your way to either room service  a    hour restaurant  or whatever quasi food meal substitute you can find within arm s reach  let Todd English P U B  be your salvation     Is it the best meal on the strip   Of course not  it s not even in the discussion   But  it has decent food  a good beer selection  relatively speaking  i e  for the Strip  good prices  and it fills a much needed situational void as described above     It s one of my favorite ways to ease into the Vegas debauchery when flying in after work from across the country   We can usually call ahead from the airport and get in without issue ,4,2014-11-05
I was happy to come here since Todd English is a well known chef and was named a National Rising Star Chef by the James Beard foundation   This place is located at the City Center and has a huge beer selection and some great cocktails   I had the Grow a Pear cocktail  which was yummm   It had grey goose  la poire vodka  sour mix  w  riesling   Also ordered the lobster roll sandwich that came with chips   To my surprise is was a pretty big portion  and although I tried my hardest to eat it all  I just couldn t   It had huge pieces of lobster claws in the roll and had a bit of a tang to it    The pub itself has a really fun atmosphere   The paper place mates has quotes from Abe Lincoln to bumper sticker sayings that say  Vegetarian  an old Indian word for bad hunter    LOL   Next time I ll grab a seat at the bar   that seems to be where all the action was that day ,4,2011-06-07
Great happy hour deals and on the weekend too  Laid back ambience with a large bar area  Sliders  wings and sangria were good  Red sangria was better than the white ,4,2015-02-15
What can I say   the entire experience was off the charts   Great service  food was perfect  and the cocktails GREAT   We had the Lobster sandwiches which were delicious yummy perfection  we also had the house burger which my husband says ALL their burgers are the bomb  champagne mimosas and bloody Mary s all very very good    can t wait to go back   ,5,2015-03-02
Come here everytime we re in Vegas  Food is GREAT and the drinks are strong  However  service tends to be hit or miss with it mostly being the latter  Lost a star on that issue    ,3,2010-10-25
I love brunch  And I love drinking  What I don t love is cheap bloodys or mimosas that give you a headache and make you fall asleep at   o clock  Luckily Todd English P U B  carries the good stuff  While my friends have gotten the mimosas on prior visits and can totally vouch for them  it s the bloody mary bar that is truly impressive  For your spirit  they have a choice of   mid and top shelf liquors  all the same price  or   varieties of infused vodkas  These include cucumber  bacon  habanero  tomato basil and pickles  In addition  you can choose from over    different  fixins  to top off your bloody  The choices are endless  I tried the pickle infused vodka which was sweet  tangy and very smooth  It might have been one of the best I ve ever had  Now this is Vegas  so If you re for something even more intense  the P U B  also has signature bloodys  This includes the most mammoth of all  the  All About Mary   which is composed of a slider  crispy chicken wing  chilled shrimp  corn dog pop  stuffed olives  celery  carrot and pickled asparagus  I saw one being served and it was both breakfast and lunch all in itself  While         depending on your choice  for a bloody mary sounds steep  the true decadence of these are definitely worth it  Now I wouldn t want to get one anywhere else on the strip    The food is pretty solid as well  I usually get a     order from the carvery and still split it with my husband  The abundance of meat they pile on is staggering  And it s thick cut  They give you a choice of two different sauces and have a great bread selection  If you re just looking for an appetizer  the toasted soft pretzels with  wit wiz  is a tasty choice  The pretzel sticks are fresh  soft and buttery while the cheese provides a hint of tang  And then there s the beer selection  I come from San Diego  the craft beer capital of the US  and I can say It s definitely impressive  They have a little something for everyone and feature breweries from across the country  While the prices are a bit steep  they have a happy hour from     and    to late  There s also one way to get it free   At the bar there are hourglasses that they can flip  If you can chug the entire thing in that amount of time  you don t pay for it  Maybe not the most enjoyable way to drink a beer  but definitely the cheapest ,4,2015-06-26
Lobster roll is yumz but overpriced   I redeemed with   second beer challenge  X   Casual laid back atmosphere is a nice break  ,3,2011-11-06
Pub Chips are a must       Tuna Berger and fish and chips are fantastic as well ,5,2016-07-31
The place is quite pricey  but then again it s Vegas       I m having mac n cheese  sweet potato fries with a glass of lemon water ,3,2015-11-22
I went there last weekend and i was astonished at the prices     for Guinness   daylight robbery  Tuna burger was        just overpriced  I will never step foot in that place again,1,2013-04-19
This was more of a     star establishment  and was one of the worst dining experiences I ve had since I ve moved here   I have no idea why yelpers loves this place  except probably they were too drunk from the PBR specials   This has been on my  bookmark  list for awhile so after a show  my husband and I tried it for late night eats   After      pm they have a limited late night menu   Which is fine  except the quality of the food and the level of service did not meet the outrageous prices they charged for them   On top of it  it took almost an hour to bring out our food which was only four appetizers   Our waiter was one of the most uncaring  as far as if we liked our food or not  and inattentive we have had so far   The only thing we got fast from this server was the check  thank god   This is what we ordered   Spicy Crispy Chicken Wings   there was nothing crispy about these   They were soaked in hot sauce that tasted bottled and instead of having the blue cheese dressing on the side it was all over the wings  which really upset me as I don t like blue cheese on wings  but I like it on the side to dip the veggies in   I couldn t eat more than a few of these because they did not taste good  and they only came with six for         When the waiter saw we didn t really touch the wings he didn t ask if they were ok  he just took them away and didn t seem to be concerned if we liked them   Toasted Soft Pretzels   There was nothing toasted about these  they were just literally   pieces of cold pretzel bread   It came with mustard  and my husband asked for a side of cheese and they charged extra for it   They were not special and didn t warrant the     price   They could have bought them from the grocery store a week earlier and we wouldn t have known the difference   Caesar Salad   this was just a few whole pieces  not chopped of romaine lettuce   Hidden underneath was a few croutons and some tomatoes   It was like they were trying to deconstruct it but was not successful   On top of it  it was over dressed with mediocre dressing  something I forgive when I m paying normal prices  but unforgivable when the cost was        for such a small portion   Chicken Parmesan Sliders   This was about        for three sliders that was smaller size than what you would get at the slider truck   It was basically chicken nuggets with very little cheese and sauce on it  and was nothing remarkable to warrant the price and were a little dry   However   we found out it came with a side of fries  which was literally the only thing we liked about this meal   They were wonderful   All of this massively complicated food took an hour to bring out to us   And if you re wondering  no it was not crowded there at all   So we got the check and it was      both of us looked at it and just laughed hysterically for   minutes   We paid the check  gave really little tip to the shitty waiter  and left   Later  my husband got so mad over this meal he was fuming   I ve never seen him get so upset over a restaurant meal   I will never ever ever go back here not even if you paid me to do it   Todd English should be ashamed to  put his name on this place and have the gall to serve such mediocre food for such outrageous prices   I used to enjoy his PBS show but now I think he s a complete hack and deserves to choke ,1,2010-06-27
Very good pub for an informal dinner and high quality beer   Had the New Amsterdam Burger and it was fantastic   Try the Firestone IPA  but be warned that it will spoil all following drinks as they will pale in comparison   Our server was very nice and offered good advice on food and drink choices as well as brought samples of comparable brews   Will certainly try this place again on our next visit ,5,2013-08-07
Yuck  Very dissapointed in my         meal  I visited for dinner and to watch the football game   The service could not have been less inviting and the experince less memorable  The Aria has better dining choices ,1,2014-10-12
We had a wedding party of    people that was arranged ahead of time  The service was great  Arranging the party was satisfactory   Everyone enjoyed the fried pickles and huge platters of french fries  The veggie skewers were   for lack of a better word   a joke  Half inch squares pieces of vegetables on a cocktail skewer  A one biter  We couldn t discern any vegetable aside from the red onion  Two large olives would have been more filling  We had the roasted chicken and TE brisket  Flavorful  but portions were very small for a large group  Only enough brisket for about a half of cup each  Chicken a little more  Sauces were good  More than enough for the meat we had  Mac and cheese was average  Grilled asparagus was good  Again the portions were kind of stingy for the size of the group  I m guessing we were to fill up on french fries and fried pickles so more satisfying portions would not be missed  What matters is that the bride and groom were happy though like most brides and grooms  they didn t eat much  We specially ordered a wedding cake which was great looking and very good  It was bigger than we wanted or needed so I hope that servers and kitchen crew got to enjoy what was left ,3,2016-09-06
I got food poisoning after eating at the P U B  on           I can narrow it down to this fine establishment because that s all I had to eat that day   I spent my last day in Vegas in the hospital after passing out due to dehydration   Awesome ,1,2011-02-19
Fun day  went to Todd English pub for a quick lunch   What a great lunch  made even more enjoyable by the bartenders Eleanor Armstrong  and Laura Berger   Talk about outstanding customer service   Way to go ladies  ,5,2012-08-16
I am happy to pay     for a sandwich  But for that  it better be a good sandwich  This was not a good sandwich  Used to love going here  It just seems tired these days ,2,2017-05-14
Absolutely the worst food i ve had in a long time   I m surprised  because of the location  how they can actually put out flavorless food and unfresh produce   There are a lot of talented chefs in las vegas  maybe Todd English should think about hiring some of them   or at least let them add flavor to the corporate recipes    My bf got the grilled chicken sandwich  which had a big giant bun  and a small  flattened piece of flavorless chicken   I originally ordered a chopped salmon salad  but when it came  no salmon  and the rest was wilted iceburg lettuce draped over the sides of a bowl with chopped tomatoes and cucumbers inside   We also got some kettle chips and blue cheese type of appetizer that was inedible as well   Would give four stars to our server   I can t remember his name  but he was a trooper   I saw another table complaining about their food as well  so i m sure its not his first time   He tried to accommodate us  but there was really nothing he could do    The red sangria was tasty     so  i ll give one star for that ,1,2012-05-30
This pub is awesome  The best part is the music    Food is great   perfect variety to please a larger crowd  Good happy hour specials at   pm  Wait staff and manager really make the whole experience at this place  Definitely coming back here again during our short trip here in Vegas and all future trips  Thanks for   star service ,5,2015-10-09
Overpriced to the point of insanity   Portions were good    beer was exorbitantly priced as were the sandwiches   There was no wow factor on this menu  but I found the quality and taste both very satisfying   Service was fair    it was like a taste of Manhattan in the desert    prices and all   Nice ambiance  poor value ,3,2017-08-30
Very disappointing  It has re opened without the Todd English brand  and is so much worse  My wife s lobster roll was tasteless  and upset her stomach   I had the steak and fries which was thin and rubbery  My beer came in a plastic tankard  Ugh   Stay away ,1,2017-12-30
Lobster rolls and beer    Strip pricing but worth it once in a while  Drool  Yelp thinks I need to write longer reviews    Otherwise it will only post as a tip  Just the tip  Just to see what it ll feel like  Try the lobster roll  Just the tip ,5,2015-09-25
My favorite place on the strip  Great beers and food  Perfect atmosphere ,5,2013-04-16
How oh how have you been hiding from me     Everything about the lobster roll is mouth orgasmic    Including the roll   So be careful anti carbs citizens   The grilled cheese bacon panini is p horrifically amazing    I dare you to try it,4,2012-10-11
Worth a repeat visit  Not your everyday Las Vegas dinner  Definitely comfort food  great bar,4,2015-06-10
Cold food  crappy drinks  very poor service  They ran out of Bacardi rum and tried to serve Cruzan  They fest up when questioned on it but did not take it off the bill  Food was undercooked and cold And the staff was just short of rude ,1,2017-02-10
Love the place  The bloody s are amazing  Who knew you could have lunch in glass with all the delectable nutrients  Happy lunch time ,5,2016-01-23
Was in town for a convention and my group was looking for something relatively inexpensive that fell into the  comfort  food category  The restaurant itself was mostly empty and it showed in the staff  To say uninterested is an understatement  It seemed as though working that night was a chore for every staff member we observed   We ordered some fried pickles for the table as well as Todd s tacos  Caesar salad  and Prime Rotisserie sandwich as entrees  I also ordered one of their adult shakes   the Brass Monkey   The pickles arrived first and were a bit disappointing  The menu states  house made  pickles  so I was not expected pickle slices but instead wedges  These were very thinly sliced pickles that did not hold onto the batter very well  The pickles came with three different sauces  all of which tasted as though they came out of a jar instead of being homemade  For      I just expected something more  order this dish in Texas and you walk away saying WOW    The taco s were average at best  Expected much more from them considering they bear the chef s name  The sandwich was more of the same with nothing that really stood out and had rather bland tasting onions  The Caesar salad was completely forgettable with one of the worst dressings I have ever tasted  It was very thin and tasted like watered down cream   The best part of the meal was the shake  which was great  Rich banana flavor and plenty of chocolate to fill up that sweet tooth   This was far and away the most disappointing food experience we had the entire time we were at the Aria  Stay away as there has to be a better  Pub  experience in Vegas ,2,2015-04-03
I am always in serious need of some solid comfort food in large portions before leaving Las Vegas  this was the perfect place for me after an entire weekend of excessive drinking  Had to get a really good spicy Bloody Mary with Goose vodka first  it was more than a great pour  very spicy and salty  not to mention strong too  loved the cheese in it    Looked through the extensive menu  lots of items looked very comforting and appetizing  I had lobster roll  it came with three small lobster rolls  kettle chips and housemade slaw  OhMY  just how amazingly flavorful and delicious they were  definitely one of the best lobster rolls I have ever had  Hubby had a hot dog with skinny fries  He loved the very well seasoned oversized all beef hot dog  I loved the fries of course  Thought we just ordered some snack food  but the portions were so big  Wish we had time for beer  the selections were huge    Think I have just found the perfect spot for comfort food and Bloody Marys ,4,2015-06-10
Everything was delicious and pretty reasonably priced for a LV restaurant with a big chef name  I had the Lobster Roll and loved every bite  With whole claw and checks of tail meat filling  and spilling out of  a perfectly toasted buttery soft roll  My mouth waters all over again just thinking about it  It came with home cooked potato chips and coleslaw  It comes in   pieces and I was with company  but I totally forgot to  or didn t want to  share it  I don t think I even talked until I finished my last bite  I also had some waffle fries  shared by the table  that was also excellent  The experience and food was so good that we even thought about returning to the restaurant again during the trip  Definitely will go again next time I m in town ,5,2013-08-01
We have been in Vegas for a few days   Out of every place that we have been  this place tops them all  Great food and customer service  Several places in Vegas service cold food and we were expecting the same  Not so at the Pub    ,5,2016-08-31
This place is in the newish CityCenter complex  My father was born in Wales and it was the first time he d been to Vegas in years  so we decided to stop by here late one Saturday evening for appetizers and drinks    The beer selection is satisfactory  No complaints there  The Tenaya brews are actually local  and it s good to see a big Vegas hotel restaurant supporting a local brewery  My nutty brown had a full flavor  not too bitter but not tasteless  Thumbs up   The Welsh Rarebit was not good  It didn t sound the most appetizing  it s basically an open faced grilled cheese  but again  since my dad is from Wales  we decided to go with it  We got what we expected  I think they have it on the menu because it s British  I doubt anyone actually orders it  I wouldn t recommend it  Thumbs down   The Kelley s Sliders were decent enough  They used juicy prime rib  If we would have stuck with another order or two of these  the experience would have been   stars  Thumbs up   Lobster Poppie was thoroughly confusing  Splitting it   ways is NOT the best way to go about this  Now I didn t get the full scoop on its history  but it was basically like a little pot pie with   pieces of lobster  way too much bread and some random filling  with corn    Might have been good if it was only for me  but again we chopped it up and shared  As with most things lobster  there was not enough lobster  Definitely overpriced  Thumbs down   Shrimp cocktail was disappointing    mostly because at       a shrimp you d expect it to be the best in the world  Thumbs down    Service was great    our waitress was polite  well informed and even took back a mixed drink that was ordered because my beautiful date didn t like it  Thumbs up    Atmosphere is what you d expect from a Vegas  PUB   Trendy  Stylish  Mostly comfortable  They allowed us to be seated right away in the barstool section  near the bar  Thumbs up    Overall it was OK    maybe a bit overpriced but if you re going for good beer then I d recommend it ,3,2010-11-10
We stopped in for lunch today and loved it   I had the lobster Cobb salad which was loaded with lobster meat and that was a surprise  I really expected a few pieces of lobster  The flavors of all the ingredients worked nicely together and I about licked the plate    My husband had the wedge salad with skirt steak   A perfect man salad  He really liked it and he s picky  We also shared some skinny fries which were fabulous    It wasn t a cheap lunch  but it was definitely good ,5,2012-09-02
Love this place  the Duck Buns are amazing   We tried the Beer Battered Pickles this time  they are so good   Service was great  except for the lack of a hostess  I asked a lady at the front if we could seat ourselves at the bar  she seemed really put out   I ll seat you     Sorry I asked you to work sweetie ,4,2015-05-07
This place was awesome   We had the Welsh rarebit for an appetizer which was incredible   Amongst us all we had the chicken pot pie  the lobster rolls  sliders and fish and chips   Everything was incredibly good    BUT    more than anything    our waiter    was AWESOME    He was so much fun and did a fabulous job    Thank you sooooo much Richard Baldino at the Vegas location     We had such a great time with great food  ,4,2012-09-15
My biggest gripe is that their stacked Bloody Mary  You know the one  shrimp  slider  pickles  etc  That special ends at       Who knew that the kitchen would magically run out of all those magical toppings at       Malarkey,1,2015-11-07
Great place to watch the games  Love the bartender and his customer service  Great recommendation on lobster roll ,5,2014-10-19
A group of us bum rushed Matt at the bar this afternoon and a great time was had by all  Some of us had to go to work and some of us did not  It was happy hour so there you go  Should you find yourself at Todd English   do stop in and let Matt find a pint just for you  he can do that as there are so many to choose from  Brilliant ,4,2015-07-15
We stopped in for a quick dinner   We sat in the bar area and ordered the shrimp cocktail and fish and chips   I am not a beer drinker  but the sangria was very good   I think the food was good  but the prices are extremely high       for shrimp cocktail and they were not the jumbo shrimp ,4,2015-05-09
I ve been to the Todd English PUB several times during business trips to Veags both with coworkers and many times alone  The service has been great on all occasions  When alone I ve never been put in a corner or asked to sit at the bar  The staff treats all guest with the same attention and friendliness    YUM YUM YUM The food is so much better than your average pub food  The organic chicken pot pie was so good with a flaky crust and creamy sauce  and the corn dog puppies is enough food to be a meal    I will return again and again ,5,2012-04-05
You get what you should expect on the strip with this place  The service is really hindered by a management practice of being under staffed  Our server apologized to us for a bottle neck at the bar because there was only one bartender on Saturday night at the busy hour  I asked if someone hadn t showed up  and she said  no  this is normal  We always have one bartender who goes insane trying to keep up at this time  Guess the customers  satisfaction and the bartender s sanity is not worth an extra hand  The beer selection is decent  and since you re paying strip prices  and each beer takes    minutes minimum  we got a whole pitcher of tripel  No complaints there  The food was good  and of course priced high  I got the lobster rolls which were so widely lauded  I was disappointed that the main ingredient was butter  and it overpowered every other flavor  ESP the lobster  I rubbed all the butter off a piece of lobster to be able to taste it  and it was honestly not very good without its butter bath  Disappointed that a supposedly high end restaurant cannot make a good lobster dish without applying a butter solution to mask any other flavor  The chili burger was actually really good  I recommend that one  We sat outside and enjoyed great people watching while we waited long spells between service visits  Overall  you could do worse on the strip ,3,2013-11-03
Pleasant and consciousness staff not enough to cover for really mediocre food   Tough competition within a few hundred yards makes it tough to recommend this place ,2,2016-05-21
Taste    Creativity Authenticity      Atmosphere      Service    Bang for your buck     Met up with some buddies here because my buddy claims they have the best lobster roll    So after shot gunning some beers for there   second challenge we got some about   dozen oysters  the lobster roll and asparagus  The oysters were fresh and smooth alot of flavor  Now to the infamous lobster roll  now ive lived in the east coast and ive had maine lobster rolls and lobsters rolls from boston and those are gonna be hard to beat  the only place that i say came close is son of a gun in LA but this place is def on point  The roll is a nicely toasted butter smothered heavens gift to earth  the lobster is cooked perfectly not  chewy great flavor and texture  Overall im a fan of this  place great for beers and ill def be back for another lobster roll,4,2013-10-29
Nice atmosphere at City Center with a menu that has a few hits and misses   My girlfriend ordered the Moules Frites and she said they were the best she ever had and I ordered the Shepherd s  Pie which was top notch   In addition   we both ordered ice teas and the bill came to around       a terrific value   A word of caution   ordering off the menu requires some common sense as many items are overpriced   Sliders        Corn Dogs       Pretzels       Dirty Chips        Tuna Salad        Mashed Potatoes       Beers ranging from    to    ,4,2010-12-21
This is a very cool  relaxed atmosphere  The wait staff  managment staff  security was top notch  The food was PHENOMENAL  The price point was fair   You must try their raw bar too   We went twice in four days and the second evening from  pm     pm  Wednesday  they offered       beer by this time I thought that I was at a nightclub in college     It s overall a great place to let loose  eat good  drink good and listen to great music and receive EXCELLENT guest service      BTW  I failed to mention that their portions are large and the presentation was quite impressive ,5,2011-03-15
Low key vibe  more carnivorous options than a butcher shop  plenty of TVs showing every sporting event in the world  and affordable prices   this is Todd English P U B    While in Vegas I had done my fair share of spending way too much on cuisine   hey  it s not difficult to do  So  imagine my delight when hubs and I checked out this spot and left full  happy and not broke  Bonus   Service was efficient  smiley and helpful  Our server led us through the menu and provided solid suggestions  I went with the   oz  size of corned beef   which offered a hefty amount of meat on the tasty challah bread I chose  Ad for my accompaniments  the black truffle mayo  horseradish and pickled veggies went very well with my stack  o beef  Fries were decent overall but frankly  you are probably coming here for the myriad of meat options  The corned beef is certainly on point    Todd English P U B  is especially refreshing as it s not overpriced or overdone  When I find myself back in Vegas  I ll certainly come back for another sandwich and brew ,4,2011-10-21
This is a great  guy s  restaurant   That s not to say women won t enjoy this place  but it s geared towards men   The flat panels all over the place showing sports  the hearty portions   it s very manly      Came here for lunch with a friend and I loved the fresh oysters and crab claws sitting on ice  the baseball games displayed on the TVs  and the smell of roasting meats in the air   I knew I was in the right place   Started with a dozen fresh oysters   Half of them were from the East coast and the other half from the West Coast   They were very fresh and mild    We also ordered the Dirty Chips        but not by choice   I tried to order something else and they had already discontinued it from the menu   Boo   The Dirty Chips were pretty good  but they were just too much food for my friend and I to eat   They are homemade kettle chips covered in bleu cheese  bacon bits  scallions and fried chicken livers   Ugh    My arteries took a serious hit after eating some of these  but they were damn good     For our entrees  he ordered the Organic Chicken Pot Pie         chicken  potatoes  carrots topped with a puff pastry crust   It was huge   I ordered from their  meat  menu   They have a menu where you choose the meat and they carve it out for you and you get your choice of bread and condiments to make yourself a sandwich   I ordered the Prime Rib  which came out shaved and oh so deliciously moist and rare   I ordered it with the sourdough bread and creamy horseradish sour cream and mayo with truffles   Sooooo good   Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria   If you need to take a break from all the gambling and partying and just get a nice  hearty   man  meal   come to Public Urban Bar   Pros  good comfort food  huge portions  reasonable prices  laid back atmosphere  Cons  I honestly can t think of anything specific   Good job  P U B  ,4,2010-06-06
Todds English PUB is a great place to get a bite to eat and watch the game   First of all  service was lightning fast   I am not exaggerating  From order to table  it took a little over   minutes  It was actually a little scary fast   And they were completely packed with a waiting list   I ordered a New Amsterdam      oz  beef patty  shaved pastrami  kraut swiss cheese  and picklelilly  This was a very good burger  cooked perfectly  lightly seasoned  but with an excellent slightly charred Pastrami  Awesome  Got it split  and they double the fries for their separate servings  Win   Prices are decent for the strip   I think the burger and fry was around      but since they doubled the fries on the split and had the free draft beer with Yelp check in  this was a great value   They also have a dual happy hour  with     pints     wings     oysters  and    sliders      pm and   pm Late   Check it out if you are looking for some good eats ,5,2013-07-06
This place is the worst    The service is rediculously slow  Food leaves much to be desired  Do not recommend   ,1,2015-07-19
I had the most amazing time at this pub  I sat at the bar and was entertained by Aggie and Jake all day  Great beer and food selection  A must stop during your stay in vegas ,5,2017-06-16
I should have left when I saw the roach wandering around on the floor near the hostess table and the waitresses trying to divert attention away from it   I had an appetizer and a sandwich   Luckily I had a table  since the bar was full of frat boys having chugging contests   The appetizer was disgusting  cold  greasy  and completely gross   The sandwich was okay  but the bread was too hard    If you want a place to go and have an overpriced beer and bar food  eat here   Otherwise  go to one of the other great places in CityCenter or Aria   I d have to say that P U B  fails for English ,1,2010-05-09
This is a nice  non strip  feel pub that is on the strip  It is in the new Aria  The spot is tucked away with a small outside entrance  Once you enter you can definitely feel the friendly pub vibe   The bar is smack dab in the center of the place  There are a ton of seats  Or if you prefer a table you can go that route as well  The outside seating looked nice  It was full so we went for the bar seat  Our server was quick and friendly  I was starving after walking all around that day so it was nice to have good service   The bar has these mini hour glasses and apparently if you can finish a beer before it runs out the beer is free  Seems like a cool idea  I ordered the bangers and mash and my man got the grilled cheese with brie  Both dishes were bomb  The bangers and mash was rich and tasty  It had a true home made taste  Nice and hearty  The grilled cheese was really rich  I would only recommend this sandwich to those who like the stinky cheese      and a lot of it  I mean don t get me wrong it was great  It was just stinky cheeseeeee   They have a full bar and a few beers on tap  Typical bud light type beers as well as darker beers like IPA s  They had a good selection in general   If you are looking for something that doesn t feel like the strip but is on the strip    go here  You won t be disappointed ,3,2012-04-28
I would have given this place   stars but because of some of the staff  i have to give it    My girlfriend and I went in last night and have to say that aside from some of the staff behind the bar  everything was exceptional  We went in for their late night happy hour  My lady got a Firestone double jack and I ordered the parabola bottle  Needless to say the beers were great  Our bartender asked us if we wanted any happy hour foods  we told her to just let us know when the kitchen was going to close in case we got hungry  She was probably one of the happier of the bunch  I think her name was Brenda  Either way she made us feel super confortable with all the tention going on behind the bar  The little bartender in the service well kept complaining about a lot of things and kind of made us uncomfortable  and the taller lady was really loud and off putting  I guess something happened on the other side and both made it very obvious that they weren t happy about it  Brenda tried her best to make sure we were having a good time despite all the negativity  She even gave us some to go waters for our walk back to the Paris  Other than those two ladies  it s an awesome place for great beers at great prices during happy hour  Next time we ll grab some food ,2,2014-09-07
Here s the deal  On Sundays all I do is crave a good place to watch football and have chicken wings  sadly I cannot find that place in Los Angeles  So I m happy to say Todd English Pub in Vegas is just what the doctor ordered  The wife gets a Bloody Mary of a lifetime and I get to have quality chicken wings and watch football  WIN WIN    Also all their food is good   I should know  it came with the Bloody Mary my wife ordered  Great sliders  shrimp  and you have to get the pretzels too  Too bad this place is in the Aria where all the snooty salad eating rich folk don t know good bar football watching Sunday fun day food  If you are in Vegas and want to watch a game drink good Bourbon and bloody Mary s and watch football Todd English in the super high end aria is a must  And Janneke is the sweetest most knowledgeable outgoing understanding and best waitress we have encountered in Vegas  Go here ,5,2015-11-08
Food was fine but service was atrocious  Unprepared staff for party of    yet forced gratuity ,1,2016-03-02
OMG I wish I could come back soon to eat everything else on the menu   Its high end bar food for sure  the lobster roll was the best I had   Great beverage selection and dont forget to make your own bloody mary ,5,2013-02-07
Todd English PUB is located between the Aria and the Crystal shops on the Strip  I ve heard of and seen Chef English on the Food Network   I wanted to check out his food and see how it compares with the likes of Gordon Ramsay and Bobby Flay  My wife and I shard their Vanilla Malt Shake       I had the signature Brown Butter Lobster Rolls       and my wife had their CBLT        The shake wasn t that sweet and tasted like melted vanilla ice cream goodness  The lobster rolls came with   mini lobster rolls and house made potato chips  As a first timer eating a lobster roll  I thought it was pretty rich tasting and delicious  A little too much butter for me but thats about it  The chips had a nice crispy  crunchy to them that lets you know they didn t come from a bag  My wife gave her sandwich an       She was kind enough to give me a bite of her sandwich  I thought it was good and the chicken was a pretty thick piece of meat    Overall  I would come back again to taste the rest of the menu and their beers ,5,2015-03-02
I ve heard through the vine that this place has changed in name and menu  and kept some popular favorites  My family enjoyed  still enjoys   the deconstructed  I think that s what they say  Reuben sandwich  they come here for that    We came for a family dinner recently and they were able to seat    of us very comfortably  The place is nice  modern industrial  clean    It is said that the lobster roll is one of the better picks  so a bunch of us ordered it  I think someone was disappointed  My husband maybe  Or my mom  It was fine for me  but not where I d come to get lobster rolls anymore  Nope    I ll come back for the oysters and beer  and flights  That was very worth it  Service was great ,3,2018-02-20
After finding out we had an extra day to spend in Las Vegas  my friend and I happened into Todd English s for lunch  Everything was fantastic from the moment we walked in   right as they opened at      The service was genuine   helpful  we sat at the bar with Ralph and he really made our day  We were searching for a hotel   he reccomended one we never would have otherwise found   it turned out to be an amazing place  The food was very tasty and generously portioned   I had the lobster rolls  another great reccomendation by Ralph  they were buttery and the lobster was nice and tender  The menu is fun and diverse  and they have a superb beer selection  The whole staff was great  loved the atmosphere  overall just a great spot for lunch ,5,2013-07-23
Sometimes you just want a nice beer in Vegas  and it turns out this place wedged between Aria and Crystals was a solid choice for some afternoon libations  We actually came here twice during our weekend trip  and it was a solid choice for both food and a wide beer selection  I think we even had champagne    The style of the restaurant is fun    it s got that modern pub look that s not trying too hard to look old  and there is a great little patio area for people watching  Although we did get some odd looks for sitting out there  but hey December in Vegas is basically summer to Seattleites like us    One word of warning  if you re planning on using your Aria dining credit here you technically can t  I only found this out after checkout that the credit only applies to restaurants  in Aria   After about a half second of stating my confusion to the customer service associate said not to worry about it and applied the credit anyway  So it worked out in the end  but c mon  half of this bar is basically in the hotel and they are all under the MGM umbrella anyway ,4,2012-12-27
Great beer selection  You also don t want to pass up the Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning  Fantastic  Excellent bar staff  Great place to socialize and enjoy a few rounds ,5,2013-10-29
Apparently this was Todd s English pub  but it just reopened  Ordered the pastrami sandwich which was alright  The meat was good but the sauerkraut was overpowering  The lobster sandwich was forgettable and lacked flavour  The preztel has less flavour than auntie Anne s pretzels  Overall  the food is not worth the price and we won t be returning ,3,2017-12-29
The food we had was overpriced and of the same quality that I could get at the British pub back home  We had the Ropa Vieja for an appetizer  meat was tender  and the sauce flavor was good   highlight of the meal  above average but not great   My wife ordered the Roast Chicken Pot Pie for dinner  and she was very disappointed  She called it chicken soap with a biscuit on top  The flavor was very ordinary  and the consistency was overly soupy  I had Todd s Fish and Chips  No different than at home at the Britannia Arms in San Jose and    more expensive   And the Brit is owned by Owen Nolan  the hockey player   Overall  the meal was a disappointment and one of the less enjoyable I ve had in Vegas ,2,2013-05-11
Great food   try the carving portion of the menu  YUM    Great waiter too   Would have given   stars if not for the hostess who refused to give us a booth   The place was half empty and she had the nerve to say that the booth section is for reservations only   Who makes reservations at a PUB    Then she seated a couple   minutes after us in a booth   By the way  most of them were empty during our whole meal   I will go back for the food and wait service   hopefully she quits  ,4,2010-08-28
Chug chug chug chug    second challenge  Pick a beer thats less than             If pint is empty and ON THE TABLE by the time their timer is out its on the house  They are strict about that    In other  less college esque news  the food and drinks at this place are pretty good  They normally have pretty good oyster specials  The one they had when we went was a dozen oysters and a beer for      The food portions in general are always pretty big and the fare is tasty    If you check in on Yelp they ll give you a free corona lite  which may or may not be worth getting  but hey  it s free and you don t have to chug it ,4,2015-08-05
I always tell myself  don t order room service  it s a friggin  rip off  no matter where you re staying   The Belgian waffle  though  at Aria was pretty damn good but     good  dunno   For lunch I decided to get off my lazy ass  wade through the Rolex wearing computer sales nerds and go to Crystals   Luckily  I didn t have to go through much of Crystals as Todd English P U B  was right by the Aria entrance   Since it was like three o clock getting a table wasn t a problem   Although I m sure the fish  n chips are terrific  I decided to have something    I m sure I ll pay for in a while    I don t see everywhere   A nice grilled bologna sandwich   The bologna is from Italy not some horrible feed yard in the midwest   Also had the giardiniera   Both were terrific     I was advised that between three and six all wine and beer is half price   I was only bummed that I couldn t share this with my foodie gf   She loves trying new things     If you re looking for a quick bite     a quick GOOD bite     this is a great place ,4,2011-03-30
I ve had better    eh     Had the West Coast Burger  ground beef was over powering and the fat fries that came with the burger were soggy  A BIG     Crispy Duck Leg with Bred and Black Truffle Mayo and BBQ Sauce  preassemble  duck meat was good but bread was eh    Don t think I ll return again ,2,2011-08-14
Excellent   Been here on three different trips now   The food is varied    it s hard to choose     but uniformly excellent   Big portions    once we took lunch back to the Vdara and basically had it again  happily   for dinner   Everything has been great  and don t fear ordering the basic stuff  like the extra long chili dog ,5,2013-06-17
I own several restaurants in and around the Boston   Tampa Bay area s  I recently was on a vacation to lovely Las Vegas and happened to get a table at the Todd English Pub for dinner  I have eaten at many of Todd s restaurants and so I wanted to give it a try  It was my husband and I that had the meal  We started with the seafood as the server highly recommended it  To my surprise it was some of the best shrimp   oysters my husband and I had ever had  The server was very help full and recognized whenever we needed something despite looking very very busy  Being in the restaurant business  I know what it is like to be very busy in a high paced environment  I had the Turkey for my actual meal  The server explained that it was a sandwich you get to build and create on your own and that was exactly what it was  Bread on the side with two mediocre sauces and the meat  The turkey was very dry and not too flavorful  The thing that made this dinner stand out to me was the seafood and the service that was provided  Our server was a younger man named Nate  He even gave us a card with his name on the back to return  In fact we did return and asked for him as I am a stickler for service  I told him about the turkey and he then recommended things based on my taste and I was completely pleased  I would give the food a   star rating where as the service made the two trips a five star experience  My husband enjoyed his meal and actually got it both times we visited  His meal was the fish and chips  The server was very knowledgeable about the beer as well  He explained a few beers to us and we tried what he had recommended based on our style  We told Nate that the service out shadowed the food and it was why we came back to the restaurant  He thanked us multiple times before we left and seemed to be very pleased we enjoyed our visit  Please visit the Todd English Pub and enjoy  p ,5,2010-03-17
Went here on Super Bowl Sunday  This is the third year in a row that I have gone to this same pub  This time it was a major disappointment  I booked   months in advance  I was asked if I wanted a barstool table and I responded yes and even the general location I would like to be seated in   My table was across the room and were the normal table which is extremely hard on my knees  that is why I asked for the barstool table   The menu was a scaled down version of the past  almost no vegetable sides and most of the menu was potato based which makes it hard for someone with a food allergy  But  the food was ok  the presentation was non existent and the service all depends on your wait staff  The waiter we began with was pretty good and attentive  When the shift changed the service fell off a cliff  we were constantly trying to find our waitress and most of the time she was off in a corner talking to other members of the staff or watching the game   I have never spent over      at a restaurant and got that kind of service  Overall this was a giant miss  I won t make the mistake of making it four years in a row next year ,1,2018-02-07
I came to Todd English PUB after a lunch at Smith and Wollensky  So I wouldn t normally be down in this area  I felt the place overall was overpriced  I like the decor and the menu was plentiful but overpriced non the less   I came for happy hour which gave some relief on the drink prices but a side of fries was     I had their sangria which is basically wine with a little bit of peach at the bottom  I wouldn t go out of my way to venture here again ,3,2014-03-11
Perfect pub  Kinda big  but it s Vegas  EVERYTHING s big  Great pub menu and tons of beers to choose from  Plus screens for the hubby to glue his eyes to   Service was great  Food was gastropuby  a win win ,4,2011-07-17
If you re coming to Vegas you ve got to check out Todd English P U B  first of all they carry over     craft beers  That s real beers  not just Budweiser  Coors  Miller Lite  The staff is amazing THANK YOU Agie for all the great conversation and info  The ambience here is relaxed  carefree and easygoing ,5,2017-02-12
The food is terrible  I still feel sick to my stomach  We got the  junk chips  and thought that would be a great part of our cheat meal     Just don t even do it  We also went for the pastrami sliders and I ve never had bad pastrami before  I don t know what it was  but I will definitely not eat here again  Great place for beer  great location  great happy hour and awesome service  Reconsider if you re thinking about the food  Wish they could change up the menu for some tastier options ,3,2014-10-12
I heard of Todd English when he was on Top Chef  I never tried out his famous Olives joint  mainly because it is rather expensive  but then Todd does us all working folk a favor by opening up this relatively inexpensive place located in Crystals at City Center  The dude basically takes traditional english pub food and jazzes it up  I ordered the beef brisket carved sandwich and fries  and i was surprised by how tender the beef was  You make your own sandwich  the meat was on the side with the bread and some pickled veggies  The star was the dipping sauce  if you eat here you MUST order the black truffle mayo  To die many times for  I would venture forth into red neck country  steal a hillbilly s truck and false teeth if it means I can eat this stuff again  Oh yeah  as expected they have a very impressive list of beers to give you alcoholics a joy gasm  Sandwiches are between    and    bucks for a half order  if you want more meat  that is more money ,5,2010-08-02
The chef makes the best duck buns for appetizer and lobster roll are key  The beer on tap is out of this world  Many selections and if you chug a beer in under   seconds it is free ,5,2016-04-08
This place is terribly overpriced  which for Vegas is expected  but they don t have the food to back it up  We started off wanting drinks  but they have run of the mill beer for double what it costs in casinos     for a PBR  really      for a Corona       for any acceptable beer   Crazy   I got the fish and chips  It came with slaw  which was good   a few pieces of flavorless fish  mushy thick fries  and a couple of sauces  This mediocre collection of fried food can be yours for the low price of      I personally would rather have fish sticks from the supermarket   My girlfriend got steak tacos for      and she liked them  They had a good flavor and came with some Mexican rice that wasn t great    I m not cheap  but please save your money and eat at any of the other amazing places in Vegas  If you want to blow some cash on great food head over to Joe s ,2,2016-05-17
Pricey crab cakes and chili  Had to flag someone down to give us a drink   UMMMM     isn t this a bar      Meh   not impressed ,2,2012-02-27
   Overpriced food       Not so friendly staff   called in and reserved a table  came in and they said they don t reserve tables  My friend who called in said the person on the phone had a strong accent and it was easy to tell who it was so she complained  So they  had to give us a table anyways  then the waitress told me I had to down the rest of my Fat Tuesday before I was allowed to sit down  Rude      Tables in the back are super close together  have to squeeze between chairs to get in and out      Beware that it is a PUB meaning it will get LOUD  Everyone freely yells and screams as they re watching the games on the TV   But i do have to admit that some of the menu items was delicious and some were ok  I would recommend the rotisserie steak sandwich  It was cooked perfectly and they gave a large amount of fries with it  I don t think it was worth     though ,3,2014-06-24
I stopped in here for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised   It s a large  casual space with really friendly staff   I sat at the bar and ordered chicken wings and sliders   Both were very good   I also liked the free peanuts and the fact that you can throw the shells on the floor   They had about    beers on tap   The great selection of interesting craft beers was impressive   I d definitely come back for happy hour or a regular meal if I m in the mood for an upscale casual dining experience ,4,2011-10-07
WOW   THIS PLACE HAS GONE DOWN HILL BAD      We dined here for the second time on June      The experience was awful from the service to the food   We could not wait to leave   The service was just awful   Our French fries were like card board  the lobster rolls tasted bland and pre cooked   No refills on soda and had to ask for our drink twice   Also waited for    minutes before anyone gave us service at the table   We were there around  pm hardly anyone in the dining area and the service was still bad   I felt like I was at an upper scale Denny s restaurant   We will never return   The entire experience was bad ,1,2016-06-27
I went there specifically for the prime rib sliders  which I had enjoyed from my last visit and highly recommended to others   Returned looking forward to the delicious  melt in your mouth sliders and instead got a mouth full of gristle  fat and inedible food   The iceberg lettuce salad was a mess   Service was attentive and efficient   It is not easy maneuvering around Vegas so it is really a bummer to go out of my way to a restaurant and then have it be so disappointing ,1,2011-02-25
Good food  ok fish tacos  good vibes  The popcorn snack was a weird touch  but hey it s different   Staff was friendly and prices were decent for the strip ,4,2015-02-20
Cool casual atmosphere to drink beer and have a loud conversation   Come here during happy hour  cuz its pricey    But the   stars are earned  by there fish and chips the best I have ever had  it was really damn good ,5,2013-01-11
I really like beer and enjoyed the wide selection offered here  Our waitress was really knowledgeable about each and was able to offer great suggestions  The food does not disappoint  the footlong hot dog was great  as were the lobster rolls  Worth visiting if you haven t before  and worth returning to if you have ,4,2015-07-24
Simply put  don t bother         for   beers and a kids shake is outrageous         for fish and chips will give you an indication of what to expect      signs is bull      Service is slow and unattentive  Never again ,1,2015-03-25
Came here a few times during a recent trip to Vegas   The drinks are alright   The bar area  has a fun vibe   If you can drink your beer in under   seconds  you get it for free   A friend did that  and it was hilarious watching him   Ate the fish   chips here and they were mighty tasty    Overall  worth a visit for the fun ambience and good bar food ,3,2010-06-26
Was pleasantly surprised  I was a little leary after reading all the mixed reviews  After perusing the pictures  we decided to try the lobster roll  wow this was delicious  The lobster was so fresh  and it comes with coleslaw and housemade kettle chips  We also ordered the    oysters  and ended up with   more orders they were so good  The bar has a Yardhouse type vibe to it  Would be fun to check out for happy hour  I will definitely come back  there were plenty of items on the menu that I want to try ,4,2012-08-07
A few years back my Vegas group did a Pub themed Vegas weekend  hitting both Todd English s and Gordon Ramsey s    Todd English was by far the best    So  we Took a group of    for my daughter s   st b day  including      year olds       year olds  and      year old grandparents with food allergies  and demanding expectations      I worked with Carol to reserve the table  since it was a large group  and everything went smoothly over email   My only request was that we have a great server  and Steve did not disappoint   When we arrived  the table was ready  and Steve introduced himself to me  confirmed that he was aware of the allergies  and assured me that he would take care of everything   Drinks were ordered  and the best appetizer ever   junk chips arrived   Everyone s meals arrived in sync and hot  and everyone loved their food    And  even though the    year olds could not hang with the    year old dad when it came to the   second challenge  a great time was had by all   Thank you Carol for organizing a great night ,5,2014-09-08
I went for the fish and chips today  Ate the whole thing and was definitely full  All the servers wear their favorite sports team jersey  I didn t have the burgers  but I heard that on the bread  Next time I come here I ll try the burgers  The portions are very large ,3,2014-12-15
Busy  noisy place  But that is not why it earned two stars  First problem was that two of the three beers we ordered were flat  Something that a well trained  caring waitress should have noticed  Once we pointed it out  she cheerfully apologized and fetched two different beers  The second problem was that the burger that one of us ordered as  medium  showed up not medium rare  or rare even  It was bloody  Some obvious lack of attention in the kitchen  Our still cheerfully apologetic waitress hustled off to replace it    The dirty chips are an interesting appetizer  but probably not something that many people would make a regular habit  The rest of the food was not bad  but a bit forgettable  It appeared to me that the menu was designed primarily for novelty  This was my second visit  So I guess the novelty has worn off    I am sure that this place will stay busy and thrive  but with so  so many choices in Vegas  I probably won t return ,2,2012-03-15
This review is strictly for their amazing Bloody Mary meal  My husband and I are huge Bloody Mary fans and we were super excited to try out this legendary Bloody Mary that had all the fixings  from a slider to your usual veggie garnish to a chicken wing   We were surprised it didn t tip over with the weight of food  This special treat is a bit pricey but well worth it    We had a seat at the bar and had to be somewhere in    minutes and made it on time  The service was quick and our bartender was super pleasant    The overall ambiance of the place was like a college pub  It was super busy and had an average noise level   We absolutely enjoyed the Bloody Mary and want to come back to try their food since the Bloody was so good  My husband and his friends want to head back to try and see if they could do the beer challenge  Chug a beer in   seconds  ,5,2017-04-15
We have gone to Donato Enoteca several times over the past four years  The food was good and authentic Italian  and the wines were great  The last time we went   about three weeks ago   did not meet expectations  The food was still good but not as good   They changed the menu since we first started dining here   The per glass wines were not as good with the two wines that we ordered  It was a nice dinner but not on par with what we experience previously   The astonishing thing we found had to do with what we see is the owner chef s direction for the restaurant  They now offer two tasting menus  a two course tasting menu for      per person  and a three course tasting menu for      per person   I called later to verify that is per person   That is absurd  the tasting menu at Manressa  a   star Michelin restaurant  is      per person  Donato Enoteca does not compare with one of the    best restaurants in the world  We think Donato Enoteca is getting ahead of itself  and I m positive about their future direction ,3,2015-12-04
You can hear some pretty interesting conversations in this place  its packed with guys during lunch AND dinner   I like this place for a couple reasons       it s SUPER casual and laid back      I can come here and hang out with my girlfriends guy friends and just have a drink      most of the food sounds pretty good      and some have an interesting twist     The duck buns are UHHH MAZING here   They were the perfect portion for me     small buns with shredded pieces of duck dipped in hoisin sauce  and scallions on top   nothing else  that s right  no side of fries or anything        for this is pretty pricey  but this beats a lot of other restaurant food options in the ARIA City Center area   They have a RAW section where you can order what I hear are pretty good oysters too      and of course it s a pub so you ll find other things like beer on tap  burgers fries  pot pies  beans  etc   The environment in here is pretty cool   They have bar tables where you insert your credit card into this machine  and can pour your own beer from tap   WOW    They have a couple huge large dart boards too  but you don t use real darts of course since it s in the bar area   they re magnetic   I ll def be back to try other salivating items on their menu ,4,2012-03-08
We were planning to go on vacation somewhere  and my husband sold me on the idea of Vegas in one fell swoop   We can get those lobster rolls from P U B   Yeah  okay    They were just as good as we remembered  brioche perfectly toasted with tons of brown butter flavor  sweet chunks of lobster  not too much mayo or anything else mucking things up  and a perfect bread to lobster ratio    This time we opted for the waffle fries to go with  and they were outstanding  Flavorful  cooked to perfection    Also had the mushroom sope  which was tasty  but not on the same level as that lobster roll business    Overall  I was really impressed with the menu  so many items on it that I want to come back and try   There was a small snafu with the waitress not wanting to give us the free beer offer with Yelp check in   Uh  I ll have to ask my manager    we don t do that any more    but she did end up honoring it    P U B   we ll be back ,4,2016-03-25
A must stop every time I visit Vegas  The service so casual and can either be attentive or lacking  I ve never had a bad experience  but at the same time I m not very needy  I see others getting impatient but for some reason it s never affected me   The food is outstanding    I ve had a few different items but the lobster rolls are beyond good  The sauce  presentation  and portions were perfect  Most recently I sat at the bar  watched some sports and just had an overall great time  I left with a           bill and was very pleased with everything ,4,2012-06-19
I have no complaints here   There were several games on and while this is not a sports bar  there are a few TV s that the hostess accommodated our seat request several hours before the reservation   I got the prime rotisserie sandwich with fries  both very good   Wife got a salad and mac   cheese  both good   My wife did not like the crab cakes  but I did   Good service ,4,2016-10-31
Exactly like any other phony British gastropub but with a lot more attitude from the self absorbed bar staff and a lot less choices at the raw bar  Not my cup of tea ,3,2013-06-05
Walking into any restaurant on the Vegas strip is always a gamble  no pun intended   The massive billboards with famous faces and  world renowned  emblazoned everywhere leads the uninitiated to believe that there s something special hidden behind these giant glass windows   I had  meh  expectations walking in  and I wasn t far off    Todd English P U B  is conveniently located only yards from the front desk of the Aria hotel in the middle of the strip  and makes its presence known to anyone checking in or out of the resort   Billing itself as an excellent place for craft beers  and considering its close proximity to my room  I decided to go there at the recommendation of the man checking me in     A slow sunday evening meant quick seating at a large booth near the bar  and relatively quick service from a friendly guy named  Cory    Lighting was a problem   There wasn t nearly enough of it  especially for the   o clock sunday dinner crowd   Using the light from my cell phone I discovered that the beer menu is rather long  which is nice  but is on the pricey side if you want to drink a lot   The food seemed appealing  especially given the enthusiasm with which Cory suggested the fish and chips meal   I settled in  preparing myself for greasy and salty post flight recovery food   The food arrived so quickly it left me and my companion wondering if they had a stack of them waiting for someone to order   Seriously no more than    minutes elapsed between the words  Fish and Chips  leaving my mouth  and that same fish chip dish entering my stomach     The portions were a bit off   Only   pieces of fish about the size of a deck of cards  accompanied by a mountain of potato wedges that must have weighed   pounds   I think I could have done with     less potato  and     more fish   The fish was nice  not too heavy or oily  and the breading wasn t mushy or bland   They also plate this dish on an aluminum pan with a piece of paper beneath it   Presumably this is to aid in the dishwashing process  but I kept pulling little shreds of damp paper out of my mouth as I ate   In hindsight I think I would have ordered something different   In summary    Atmosphere  dimly lit  plenty of space  Service   Attentive and friendly  Food   Points for speedy delivery  but not for portion size or plating  Drinks   Varied but pricey       Meh s for effort   Would have been   if I had gotten   more piece of fish to eat ,2,2014-07-21
Nice Looking concept   Nice Theme   Nice Outside Seating   too bad they fail at food and common sense as who ever is running this place should absolutely seriously have no Job    A Sports Pub with comfort food as their theme with over     Craft beers  bar seating  tables in the back  high tops along the wall and large TV Screens to watch all your favorite games   That last line is tongue in Cheak    Arrive about    PM to watch Sunday Night football have some drinks and grab a bite after high fancy dining the last   nights we need some comfort food    I arrive early to get a seat and I m not joking     of the TV s are tuned to Local News        are tuned to nothing but a Black Direct TV Screen from earlier NFL Games that have ended and a couple have MLB Playoffs on   I inquire to the bartender will the Sunday night game be on any of the blacked out TV s as the areas where the game was scheduled per the hostess in the front were already taken   His answer I have no control of TV s they are all pre programmed   I go to the front door and ask  and she directs me to again the TV s that have patrons already seated    Ask another bartender who states I pour drinks not change channels    Finally give up and sit figure hell they have to put the game on right     I even ask for the Manager of the place and told he is busy will get to me shortly       Steaming but too late to find viewing elsewhere I sit and wait    Served some cold popcorn in a bucket and order some wine by the glass and a  beer and a few sodas for friends    I m not cheap but        for a draft beer and        for  Glass of wine when the bottle costs        retail is outright robbery    Game starts and finally MGR comes over and I inquire regarding the TV s     Deer in Headlight look    not till   minutes remaining in the  st quarter are the TVs tuned to football  BRILLIANT        If I own this place he would be digging ditches    Some food            For   U   Shrimp Cocktail     Good but Price points are insane           for Chili Recommended by server    was ground beef    it was hearty  plentiful  not very tasty and had no sauce it was more like dry beef with a little sauce  onions          Clam Chowder was decent    did not appear homemade          Onion Soup best of the appetizer lot    Entrees    We are Famous for our  Lobster Rolls             for   puff bread with chunks of lobster with the worst Sauce ever tasted      prime Beef sandwiches with swiss  carmelized onions and Au Ju        were pretty tasty and the skinny fries hot and fresh         watch some more of the game   and finally pack it in     I find No redeeming feature regarding this place aside from theme   Food was simply OK  service spotty  bartenders  front staff  and management clueless and price points that are in short Ridiculous    Sorry I ll pass this was an epic failure ,1,2016-10-10

One of our favorite places to eat and drink when we come to Vegas  Great food and beer  Everyone is always nice  Mark was especially great  Bailey  Jameson  Joel and I were lucky to chat with him ,5,2016-11-21
Every time we re in Vegas  we come here  The junk chips are an appetizer  but could be a meal for   people  They have a ton of BBQ on them  definitely a must have  I always get the prime rotisserie sandwich and my husband always gets the burger  We never change our order when we come here because it s that good ,5,2015-08-30
Well  that was disappointing  The   of us are looking for a spot for dinner in Vegas  We ve been wanting to try Todd English for over a year so we decide to meet up there   I walk in and stand for at least   minutes without a hostess being at the front  Eventually both hostess come back together and I am not joking both ignore me as I am standing   feet away  with a line behind me  Thankfully the  executive   chef comes by and all of the sudden the hostess see I m standing  We are then seated    Upon examining the beer list on the menu chalkboards we still have a few questions so when our waitress comes by we ask her about the  trappists  beers they carry  The menu just says Rochefort  and I ask her which of the Rochefort s she carries but she has no idea  After checking she comes back and tells us it s the Rochefort      which by the way is the worst of the three that the brewery makes  why would you carry that one   So we decide on Dechutes The Abyss instead  For some reason she only rudely asks for my ID  even though my friends and I are all the same age  watch out ABC    Minutes later she comes back and informs us that they are all out of the Abyss   of course     Since the rest of their beer list is very boring and unoriginal I m forced to order an Arrogant Bastard  My friends order their beers and she runs away as I am trying to order Appetizers  I flag her down and order some sliders and pretzels  Our beers come out and I immediately know that beer I ordered is wrong  Its much much darker than it is supposed to be and tastes nothing like the Arrogant Bastard  I try to find my waitress but to no avail  So i set my beer on the edge of the table  fully untouched  but she ignores it  A food runner drops off our  toasted pretzels and they are stone cold  Worse than any pretzel I have ever had in my life  I place our untouched pretzels with the beer at the edge of the table praying to God someone will take them away from us  But of course they never do  and I am forced to sit staring at them   The sliders and fries were actually pretty good  but they use Heinz ketchup  which is a big no no for any gastropub    As we sit hungry and thirsty we decide that our dinner will have to take place somewhere else  Its easily an hour since we walked into the Pub and our waitress hasn t taken our entree order   She then comes by and asks us how everything is  when there is   untouched beers and the pretzels at the end of the table  We simply ask for the check and she leaves without saying a word  She then brings the bill and drops it off without a word  With our dishes still waiting to be taken away  We pay the bill and leave   I will never return to this place even though I love the concept and am in Vegas all the time  This is an extremely poor rendition of a gastropub  Hire some employees that actually care about what they are doing  Don t brag about  you don t carry bad beers like bud  when you actually DO carry terrible beers that are just as widely distributed as bud  I would not describe them as a craft beer bar ,1,2011-12-04
I had an amazing cheese burger here  the bun was delicious along with the   oz angus beef patty  Great beer as well and they even have a foosball table   great job guys  ,5,2012-09-11
I am highly disappointed  A year has gone by and they have changed their lobster roll  The lobster is now served on what appears to be   dinner rolls rather than toasty top split hot dog buns  This changes the entire sandwich because the dinner rolls end up soggy     Service is also extremely poor  We were seated in the bar area even though we asked for a table and the hostess did not give us a menu  We had to wait for our server to arrive and give us one  which took almost    minutes  Unacceptable ,2,2011-07-02
Fun and vibrant place  even in the mid afternoon   The beer selection is good  though I wouldn t say that it was super extensive like a place that specializes in beer   The Fish and Chips were pretty basic  without much added flair  though I did like the side of cole slaw and peas  together    Service at the bar was friendly  though a little on the slow side due to the constant activity from the crowd   The food  however  came relatively quickly after being ordered   As many others have mentioned  the   Second Challenge involves chugging any beer  up to two per day  within   seconds to win the beer for free ,3,2013-05-12
This is a large bar basically  but they happen to serve really flavorful food and unusually low prices for vegas  It s not  cheap  food  but what you do get for what they charge is good  We skip the carvery section  pricey  and just order the rest of the menu   If you like pretzels  theirs are good  Best dip is the ware rarebit appetizer  Lobster rolls are great  the mini pastrami sandwiches are a win as well  They do a burger with pastrami added  it s also good   The real treat is the shepards pie  the beef inside is flavor packed and it s just a big hot cast iron skillet of comfort food  The skirt steak with ribeye chili on top is also flavorful and a definite winner   They do a really good twist on a manhattan called The Excellent Crystal  Oh and they have a ton of beers on tap as well  Honestly if you wanted to sit and just eat bar food  drink draft beer and watch sports  i d go here  and often do    If you make it to dessert  the bread pudding is delicious   Now the bar games     Around the bar you ll find up lit small hourglasses  They are set to   second  Order any pint  Guinness is really the best bet for speed   With hand on glass  but glass on bar  they flip the hourglass  you drink  no side drafting beer out of your mouth and nothing left over and you get the pint for free   Before you get excited  you can only do it twice I believe  Which brings us to the next game  Make a shot  take a shot   They have a couple basketball hoops on teh bar  it s easier now than it used to be   sink the nerf ball  free shot  They have made this easier   Solid food  good flavor  reasonable prices and on strip   Pretty rare ,4,2011-04-27
Ate here with my family  We did not like the food but   we were at least charged a lot for it  Thanks ,1,2014-04-01
I actually had my wedding dinner here after our ceremony  It was an unusual choice but i wanted something casual and near our hotel  This seems liked the place  They had a catering menu we ordered off  it wasn t cheap  but they provided enough food for everyone and everything for the most part was decent  I would say it was a couple steps up from bar food  The best thing was they made our wedding cake  which was      cute  feed all    of us and was delicious      red velvet with cream cheese frosting  I probably wouldnt come here again next time were in Vegas just due to all the different places to try  but if you want an upscale bar with food  you should check them out ,4,2014-02-20
Walked most of the strip before we reached the Todd English P U B  and we were very  very  thirsty for a brew  Waited about    minutes to be served during lunch on a Saturday  which wasn t too bad  Once seated  we ordered a round and were not disappointed  This is the only place outside of London that I have seen Frulli on tap  so I had to order it  of course   I went with the beef sliders  which were excellent  I was only disappointed after tasting a bite of the bison burger my friend ordered  That burger was AMAZING  that  bite  made my top ten list of best burgers in the world  but I won t get to log it until I go back and try the whole burger     The service was great  wouldn t expect any less in Vegas   I would say it was worth the walk ,4,2010-08-27
This place is great   We were there for the afternoon happy hour and enjoyed great wings  oysters  and sliders   Everything was fabulous   The beer and drink selection was extensive   Our server was super hip but very friendly ,4,2013-09-10
Open  airy  and no pretense ambiance   Great location in one of the best hotels on the strip    Now let s get to business     Amazing selection of beers and reasonable prices compared to the rest of the strip restaurants  is what saves this place    We sat at the beautiful baker s marble bar  Meticulously clean  shiny bottles surrounding    I would encourage bar or pub seats  as the rest of the restaurant seating is mediocre    We had the fried pickles and the gyoza  Random    but we weren t about to pay    dollars for a burger  at least not here  Both appys were solid  Nothing amazing  but good fresh ingredients  and hearty portions for sharing   The service was decent  but not up to par with    dollar burger prices  We heard bartenders complaining openly about split checks  without their split checks you have no check  genius  and overall the bartender staff was not cohesive at all  We felt like the staff spent more attention on their co workers than their patrons  I understand dealing with the general public can really suck  but be nice    we aren t all dipshits   Will we come here again  Absolutely    just not as quickly ,4,2014-11-16
I had to write a quick review     I really enjoyed this place  It s a fun atmosphere  with plenty of drinks flowin    They have a great little patio outside for those who enjoy the outdoors  and plenty of seating inside  including a large bar with seating all around  Large TVs to watch the game  hockey was on when we were there  I tried a few bites of everyone s food and everything was awesome  The brisket was so flavorful and the sliders were tasty  I have to say my fave was the fries  some of the best french fries I have tasted since the ones at Half Moon  Yum  Have to try them    Oh but don t forget about the   second beer chugging challenge     order any draft beer and finish it in   seconds or less and you don t have to pay for it  Awesome idea  Here in AZ we aren t able to play such fun drinking games  but Vegas is a whole different story  Little Miss Georgeann G  finished her second attempt in less than   seconds  after taking the boys advice to drink Guinness  smoother they said  Good job G ,4,2010-05-28
Mini corn dogs were tasty  How will I ever compare after having my  st Bloody Mary here at brunch  It was a meal in its own ,4,2014-12-21
To bed at     am  wake up and my buddy is still snoring  It s     pm and I need food  Grab sunglasses  head is pounding  throw on shorts and flip flops  Quietly shut door and head out  Exit casino left  A walkway  flowing water  fresh air and sun  wow  I needed that  what s this  A pub  Todd English Public Urban Bar  P U B     I give it a go   air flowing through out  plenty of seats at the bar  Despite his rumored financial difficulties  this place managed to serve up some pretty sweet food    Started off with what I hate to admit was maybe the best bloody mary I ve ever had  Pint glass rimmed with spicy Cajun pepper rub  Pickled carrots  onions  celery stalk and plenty of Grey Goose  Well prepared bloody mix  thick and substantial  Outstanding start  particularly when paired with a shot of Patron Silver  Ordered      dozen West Coast oysters  somewhere in Washington  bartender wasn t sure exactly where  no problem   they were clean  fresh  meaty and shucked with no damage to meat or shell  Excellent mignonette to accompany these bi valves    In addition  a side of house made pickled veggies   baby carrots  onions  peppers  and pickles  Great pickling job    Followed by a free Guinness   actually make that two  You get them free  limit of two  if you can chug it before sand clock runs out  not a problem on this end    Confit of duck three ways or so it seems  Really a confit leg  some shredded duck and then a breast as well  Quite good  certainly not close to La Cote Basque NYC but pretty decent considering it is served at a bar at     pm in Las Vegas  Served by the half pound or pound  a variety of dipping sauces and a choice of breads to make little sandwiches  The maple soy and black truffle mayo were my favorites  Add another shot of Patron and lunch comes to a close   time for a shower  a nap by the pool and off to the club later in the evening ,4,2011-03-19
Wow  I can t remember the last time I was excited to try a known chefs establishment  come out satisfied with the food but totally underwhelmed by the service  We went on a Sunday football day where all the servers wore jerseys  We literally sat for over    minutes with no server checking on us  We did  however receive water upon being seated but I can t believe how a  unprofessional the wait staff was in general  b  how inattentive they all were to the patrons and c  how generally lazy they all were  If a place has good food    stars is the norm  and the food we ordered was solid but I ll be damned if I give them anything more than   stars  Service was THAT bad   I ll take my business elsewhere,2,2014-04-23
    stars  Wanted to give them   but our waiter seemed to disappear and forget what we ordered a few times  No bueno   Where o where to begin  Actually this is going to be a bullet points type of review    Non Smoking  perfect for my Bestie who was Preggers at the time  Love the decor  woods with big white marble oyster bar   Shared sinks for bathrooms where the guy who hands you towels will freestyle with you tip him  which makes you want to give him a bigger tip since he s so good   Bathroom amenities free to use include  perfume  cologne  candy  gum  hairspray  gel and other things  Food was very good  need to try the lobster rolls next time  Happy people all around made it have a great atmosphere  Have drinking games  need to try next time I go    In City Center  which is where all the new nice places are  Point is   if you are in Vegas   this is a place you MUST go ,5,2012-05-04
We went for lunch which set us back      for four people   Not a great bang for your money  nevertheless  I thought it was well worth it     There was a big selection of very great beer   The mussels and fries  moule frites  was good   The fish and chips was excellent   Probably the best I ever had   It came with a delicious slaw and wedge potatoes   We also tried a few items off their raw bar and they were very very fresh and good as well     Service was friendly ,4,2010-09-21
My wife and I are fish and chips snobs having found great fish and chips in St Augustine  Fl   How do Todd s fish and chips stand up   Excellent with two exceptions   First  the fish was prepared exceptionally  being the best cod on our list  Alas  with the surname  English  we expected authentic cottage fries but were served steak fries   For that we subtracted     a point   The other     point was subtracted for the tarter sauce  which had sweet pickle instead of dill   Sweet with fried fish doesn t work   Fix these errors Todd and you will have the world s best fish and chips   Otherwise please change your surname to  Smith  or something else equally nondescript ,4,2010-07-14
Was there             had fish   chips w newcastle on   day and the other had the salad w the turkey  food was good and atmosphere is very nice  Shout out to Chloe and Brandon both were very nice bartenders    Will be making this my go to spot when I m in Vegas    ,4,2012-05-30
We were looking for good ole pub food and excited when we saw Todd English P U B   This place is great for beers but food   the quality does not justify the price   Dirty Chicken   way too salty Lobster Roll  you would imagine that it would be a freshly baked roll   The only good dish was the Shepherd s Pie   However  not enough for me to want to go back   In fact  we didn t finish most of the dishes ,2,2010-11-01
Super fun pub   Stopped in with clients looking for something casual  but quality   So impressed I came back with my family and kids   Love the extra long hot dogs  great burgers  and a fab raw bar if you are looking to get fancy ,5,2017-01-20
We had a really nice low key dinner here and it was one of the more tastier fare  as well as cheaper  during our week in Vegas  If you like beer  meat  and dark ambiance  this gastropub is for you  Drinks here come by the pint  yard  or pitcher  My friend was not a fan of beer so she ordered a yard of hard cider  which came with its own stand  I m not quite the lush she is so I settled for a pint of beer  We sat near the bar and we witnessed some patrons going for the  drink a beer in   seconds and it s free  challenge  One guy came out a winner  while the other guy threw up all over the floor  They thought it was a good sport so they comped the beer anyway  If you hear the ring of a bell throughout your service  it means someone has successfully completed this challenge   My friend ordered from the Carvery  brisket  jumbo English muffin  with maple soy and black truffle mayo   For      it was a really sizable amount of food  I ordered the brown butter lobster rolls  Outstanding   I had lobster rolls last year as an appetizer at Michael Mina s Nob Hill and they were nowhere as good as these  Todd English gets it right  Portions were generous  as well  I had trouble finishing all that delicious lobster   Service was so so  Our server was friendly but she kept forgetting things and we had to remind her a few times about them  Other than that  I would definitely recommend this place if you like good beer and good pub food  Also  thanks to their flat screens  this would be a great place to catch a game  too ,4,2010-12-30
Happy hour specials are priced right   Service is terrible with most of the staff worried about themselves and the latest gossip than customers   Nothing personal just the facts from waiting    mins to get the attention of one of   bartenders at      in the afternoon   No rush going on ,3,2016-03-21
Shocked that the boyfriend wanted to give the place four stars  as I was totally set on two stars   But he really loved his Carvery Sandwich   A group of    of us had reservations and were really looking forward to Todd English PUB     The Good  The    second pint challenge  was lots of fun and meant free beers for some guys in the group   The boyfriend loved his sandwich from the Carvery menu  pastrami  and the pickled veggies that came with   Big menu with lots to choose from   The Bad  Corn Dog Bites that tasted a lot like the samples at Costco   The Ugly  Terrible service   from pushing alcohol sales too hard  to not detailing the beers in a flight of beers  to serving the wrong drinks  beer when it was supposed to be cider   to not serving drinks at all and not bringing condiments when requested  Our server was completely indifferent to us  but more than happy to put an auto gratuity of     on the bill   The Fish n Chips which was supposed to be a signature dish was terrible  Two of us ordered it and it was gummy and the breading was too thick and undercooked     The location is great  and in general  I really enjoy Todd English s restaurants  but this one just wasn t what we were hoping for ,3,2011-02-20
Very nice atmosphere  They are always friendly and upbeat  The free check in beer is awesome  I would highly recommend   My brother and I have been here several times and have been pleased each time  They also have free peanuts for everyone ,5,2014-08-04
Had the  pork sliders    but it was almost all fat and little meat  I couldn t eat it after the first one  The salad was much better  Way overpriced for what you get ,2,2015-07-06
We had a great time here last Thursday night   I joked on my facebook page that this place serves  upscale  pub food  which I believe is oxymoron   Upscale pub food   Ha   Anyhow  the mussels appetiser  substituted the spicy tomato sauce with the white clam sauce instead   was fantastic   The mussels were tender yumminess   We ordered the recommended Fish and chips and the Lobster rolls   The fish was crispy and juicy   The lobster rolls were quite delicious  my only beef was the the lobster was actually the claw meat rather than the tail    Service was great   Very friendly   Atmosphere was fun    Oh  we also did the    oysters   First we ordered   of each oysters from VA and Baja California   Then we chased it with another half dozen of the oysters from VA   Delicious   Not bad for      Our bill was over      tax and tip   Not cheap  we are in Vegas after all ,4,2014-05-14
I ve been here before   because of it s location  It is inside the Aria   with outdoor seating right by the doors to the City Center  Ideal location   to get some fresh air  rest your feet   We ve only had the raw oysters  sliders  and some sangria  The food is good   but the service is terrible  It takes forever to get anything   menus  water  drinks  the check    ,3,2012-04-23
I was in town for a friend s bachelor party   We were wandering through Aria   and I saw P U B  on the way in   After a little indulgence in the Sports Book  solid   we checked out a few other menus before committing   Grabbed   seats at the bar   hassle free   Good bartenders   watched them officiate the     second egg timer pint chug   pretty impressed to see   guys get through it   The whole experience was solid  We chose to eat at the bar and met some good people   except for Jimmy O  taking an accidental dart in the eye  Above average  Duck sliders  Good   Dirty Chips with Chicken livers Chicken Parm sliders Lobster roll  Not so hot  Smoked Salmon Quesadilla   not bad  just not expected,4,2010-05-29
My husband and I have enjoyed this pub the last two visits to Vegas  The food is good and a tad bit pricey  I had the chicken parm sliders with a side of sweet potato fries and my husband ordered the bologna sandwich  Both were delicious  The selection of beer is impressive  we both had a pint of Killkenny  Mmmmmmm   The only negative that I would say about the whole experience was the guy at the bar who was very loud and every other word out of his mouth was vulgar  Normally  we would not be bothered but he was standing about a foot away and made it tricky to enjoy great food and great beer  Oh well     we will return and enjoy the pub again ,4,2012-02-24
Great beer   great service  Anthony was by far the best bartender we saw in all of our trip to Vegas  He was attentive  extremely knowledgeable of the beer offerings    even let us sample some before deciding on our orders  We came back twice more for drinks here due to such great service    Also  the   second beer challenge adds to a really fun environment   experience ,5,2014-05-20
I disagree that this is NOT a good venue for kids   I took our two girls here about   months ago and we had a great time   We were seated promptly  shared a fondue  salad and a sandwich    Just enough for me  a    yr old girl     yr old girl     All three of us had an enjoyable evening ,4,2018-10-26
I was staying at Aria recently and needed a place to meet some friends and their young son  This was perfect  Service was fun and friendly  food was very good and the portions were plentiful and the ambiance was really fun  There were a lot of items on the menu I would have liked to have tried  so it s a great excuse to come back soon ,4,2016-11-14
Let me start by saying they do  oz pours    I m a double neat kind of girl     They hand shuck oysters  which I was told were absolutely phenomenal   I had the grilled cheese  which was a gourmet type grilled cheese   Not greasy and somewhere between warm and cold   We sat directly at the bar  and they were great personalities and not too shabby to look at either ,5,2016-04-19
We stumbled on this place while shopping at the Crystals Shops and were excited that we were able to get in right away even though this place was packed   They had a DJ playing music and there were lots of people watching a variety of sporting events on the TV s    There were many things I wanted to try on the menu but one that I kept eyeing was the Junk Chips   Reviews I saw mentioned that this was a huge appetizer  therefore I chose to get this as my meal and share it with my husband   Holy Cow   words cannot describe the rich  powerful flavors on these chips   Tomatoes  Scallions  Blue Cheese  BBQ Beef Ragu and scallion aioli    And yes  this thing is huge    Cool atmosphere   definitely feels like a pub   Everyone looked like they were having fun and I know we did   We even came back   days later to have lunch   This time it was much quieter and we split a Pub Burger and an order of fried pickles   The burger was juicy and delicious and the fried pickles were made with house made pickles that were sort of sweet and sour   They give you   dipping sauces for the pickles and all  BBQ sauce  spicy ranch  and blue cheese fondue  paired nicely  This is a must go place for casual gourmet food ,4,2015-01-25
Unfortunately for me  my flight arrived in Vegas too late to make it here for their late night Happy Hour   However  a wonderful bartender named Courtney made sure I was not shut out despite the place getting ready to close for the evening   Rarely do I let a strange bartender pick me a beer  but she asked me a few questions about my taste and the next thing I knew I had a full plastic cup to take with me into the casino floor and it was really a good beer   The location is perfect if you re visiting the Aria and this bar certainly doesn t have that douchebag demographic associated with any place that serves drinks next door at the Cosmopolitan   Any place in Vegas that does Happy Hour this good with such great service deserves a whole lot of credit and I ve already made sure my next flight into Vegas is early enough to comfortably get in here before close ,4,2014-09-08
Good food but prices are way too much for what they offer      Bloody Mary  Ehhh,3,2013-04-30
Great option if nothing is to your liking in Aria itself   Great for sports   I was here during march madness and it was off the hook   If you are into oysters the eastern are a bit better vs the western   They have multiple choices of meat in either     or full pound options served with your choice of    excellent unique sauces on the side with diff options on bread   I highly recommend the pickled vegetables if you are into that sort of thing   And they serve a beer after my own heart   the arrogant bastard     nuff said,5,2010-03-23
Got a lot of cash  Then come here  If not keep walking  I spent  yes I can read       for lunch  Lunch      for fish and chips       for a beer  Not where I would recommend to go  This is another example of how Vegas will self destruct  Who in their right mind thinks businesses can continue to raise prices and expect to continue to entice customers  Oh yeah  that would be P T  Barnum  a sucker is born every day    Sorry  but not worth the price in my opinion ,1,2016-08-21
We came for the bloody Mary  They were out if souvenir glasses but had the mugs so we opted for that  I ordered the CBLT  The waitress suggested adding avocado  It sounded awesome  The sandwich came out and looked good but the chicken was flavorless and there wasn t much bacon on it  The chicken tasted and had the texture of boiled chicken  I would have put it on tacos but never a sandwich  I picked at half  Bloody Mary was good  My companion had the shepherds pie and that was good also  From here our waitress says she s going on break but another will be taking care of us     minutes pass and after several attempts to get the other waitresses attention I get up and get another waitresses attention so we can get our check and leave  We get the check and their is no souvenir glass listed so I ask  and the waitress says I had no idea we even did that  She was going to go ask but I gave up at that point and said never mind  After waiting    minutes and still not seeing our waitress we paid and left  We won t be going back ,2,2016-12-12
Hard to find and not close to MGM arena   food and service good,4,2016-11-13
Lobster Rolls and Junk Chips  That s really all you need to know  Gastropub with about     different beers  many of which I was unfamiliar with which is awesome  The atmosphere is really great and it is in hippest casino on Vegas  But going back to my first line    I ve never had a lobster roll  but now will seek out the P U B  every time I am in Vegas to eat them again  Service was not that great  which is where they lose a star  but everything else was perfect ,4,2015-02-09
WOW the best brown butter lobster roll   Everything about it is perfect   How can I get this in San Francisco   BTW  comes with good slaw too  Highly recommended ,4,2013-01-02
  years on and still very good   Can you drink a beer in   seconds   This is where the Hendrick s Martini became the go to   The guys behind the bar know their sh t and make the place more fun ,4,2012-12-02
I m a local and we went here after shopping at city center   The decor is super cute  food was really good  see pix    The black truffle mayo was to die for  It deserves a sentence all to itself   Order   of those b c you are going to have to share it even though you don t want to  I warned you   Lots of beer on tap  tons of English people eating here    they have HH from       HH is     price wine  beer  sangria  not bad   Food specials are a little lacking  in my opinion     oysters  or     a dozen  or    chicken wings  or     a dozen  not that impressive  average rates at best   I ordered the roasted chicken   would go back to order that again   Friend of mine got the fish n chips  excellent choice  Came with fat fries and this really unusual but delightfully tasty coleslaw that had green peas in it  My other friend got the swordfish tacos   Those I didn t like  but he enjoyed them so that s all that matters  They were covered in cheese sauce so that it looked more like a casserole than tacos  There was no way you could eat them w out a knife and fork   they were too fishy for me   More importantly  I liked the people at the bar  They were pretty much locals but all of them were really nice  They had a ton of bartenders so our drinks never sat empty   they were eager to strike up a conversation too  And they had the basketball game on  nice BIG tv s  score    We liked it so much my girlfriend texted me when she got home about when we are going to go back ,4,2012-01-19
Once again this place still holds strong   great food great atmosphere great service   happy hour is key for early eats and drinks    well great service doesn t always mean friendly   my kids love this place   just wish server was just a bit friendlier   maybe it was an off day for Kara,5,2016-12-28
This is located right next to Aria and appears as if they are attached  but you have to enter from the outside   If you re staying at the Aria  you can bill your food to your room  though     Food is decent though a bit pricey   We got the chili as an appetizer   it reminded me of a Sloppy Joe bc it was pretty sweet   I liked it  though   The lobster rolls didn t have a whole lot of lobster in them   The hamburger  which I did not try  was supposedly very good   I got the chicken pot pie  which I didn t like very much   I felt like it was mostly crust with not a lot of chicken   I did get a Strawberry Ale  which didn t taste like alcohol at all   It was like a mild bubbly Strawberry juice   liked it a lot   We also got free popcorn upon being seated at our table   Service was spotty as our server was difficult to flag down at times   Overall  not a memorable place to eat and pricey  but our meal was comped  so I guess I can t complain  ,3,2010-11-14
We decided to try this place out because we were eating late after a show and didn t want to be anywhere too fancy nor too cheap  ie chain fast casual place   I suggested here because I had seen it from time to time while going through the Crystals center on my way to from Aria  the Cosmo  etc    We were happy to see we came during their late night happy hour  We were starving so got some    wings to start  I am not a HUGE wing person  but these were very delicious and although some may find    wing  pricey  I thought they were a good deal  They give you real blue cheese too   My bf and I decided to share their carvery platter  lamb  which was amazing and came with some tasty sauces  We had several friends meet up with us and our waitress was very patient considering we had all had quite a few cocktails and the constant seating kept changing as our group grew shrunk   However  the chopped salad my bf and I also shared was awful and we actually sent it back because it was so bad  basically  chopped  lettuce and      tomato  That is all I remember being on it   Luckily our waitress took it off the bill so no worries   but one of our friends got a Caesar and wasn t thrilled with it either  so maybe skip the salads all together and just get the unhealthy bar food and meat   ,4,2012-07-09
I like it  Great hangover food  The dirty chips are crisp  creamy and have an adventurous side with the fried liver pieces  I also really like the hotdog and lobster rolls  Overall  a pretty good lunch spot to soak up last night s drinks especially if you re staying at Aria  And don t forget the PBR challenge  It really is a free beer    unless you can t chug  in which case it s    ,4,2015-06-27
Great food and even better service at this causal pub with outdoor seating lodged between the Aria and Crystal shopping center   Our hamburgers were outstanding  great fries and amazing pickles    One of my favorite go to spots in Vegas   Ask for their amazing waiter Rich   and have him pick your beer from their endless selection   He makes every hour spent there  a happy hour ,5,2015-10-16
A great place to start your night  Atmosphere is great  the food is average  There are self serve kegs  dart boards and flat screens  But the best thing about this place is their beer challenge  If you can drink a pint of beer in   seconds  you ll get it for free   Limited two times per night  But be warned  once you start  you might end up staying there the whole night ,4,2012-06-08
One of my best Vegas experiences yet  amazing food friendly service we came to watch the   er game and the atmosphere was perfect,5,2014-09-29
Todd English PUB is a great meeting place  fun happy hour and great BAR food   Gets a little crazy during sporting events and late night on weekends with guys and girls chugging mugs of beer and getting timed   If you can chug within a certain time frame  you get the beer for free  so there are lots of takers    Definitely a fun place to stop on the strip ,4,2011-02-10
Decided to grab a quick dinner   We sat next to the wait station near the bar   Waitress was pleasant  but not efficient   There was a shift change right after we ordered drinks   The waiter who took over was efficient  but not pleasant     We ordered   craft beers   It was happy hour  so they were half price at    each   The regular price is     which is outrageous   I ordered the shepherd s pie   It was good but expensive about       Overall  the food is good  but the prices are high even for this part of the strip ,3,2017-01-20
Alright alright    Customer service can make or break a restaurant and the service here is just not cutting it    We arrived  had our food ordered and no one came back to ask us how we were doing for over half an hour  I would understand if the place was busy  but there were   empty tables around  It was not even busy  Come on   Seriously       Over     minutes before my table even got our food    But my company was good so I guess it made the visit not too bad  but just a note to the management  Try not to leave your guests without any service or food for more than    minutes    let alone       And also very expensive for the tiny amount of food they give you      bucks for   small roast beef sliders that were the size of bagel bites    whattt  ,2,2011-03-29
Absolutely loved this place  Happy hour from     gets you Half off all pints  which means you pay what would be considered average anywhere else      sliders  delicious     wings  also delicious  albeit pricy for one wing  but hey  it s Vegas   Ambiance is great  service on point  and food was great  Only downgrades  Lobster roll was much more roll than lobster  and the cupcake dessert sucked  Other than that  this place was great  Can t wait to go back ,4,2011-11-13
Their take on nachos was really tasty  It has one of those menus where I just want to order everything  We had great service here  Great interior design too that doesn t feel like you re in a mall  even though you basically are ,4,2013-01-23
My fiance and I decided to stop at this restaurant for a quick bite for dinner  After seeing the menu on the outside of the door  we were anxious to see if the food was as good as it sounded    On first approach  the hostess was extremely pleasant and very kind  She sat us immediately at a booth along the wall  Our waitress  I think her name was Hayleigh  came to our table to take our drink order and my fiance and I both ordered drinks from the bar  I ordered the white sangria and he ordered a Manhattan  Our drinks took approximately    minutes to come to the table and when the server brought them out to the table  she made an excuse about the bartender being new and walked away  This did not bother us much except for the fact that we probably would have ordered  nd drinks if they had not taken so long   Before she brought the drinks  the server asked if we were ready to order and seemed inconvenienced when I mentioned that we would like to order an appetizer  However  we ordered the mussels and they were really delicious  Our food came out before we were finished with the appetizer  I ordered the Lobster Rolls and my fiance ordered the RIbeye  My Lobster Rolls were delicious  i cannot express how much I loved them  Definitely a must try if you happen to want to try this place out  My fiance s ribeye was cooked well  however the potato wedges that came with it were cold and soggy  By this time  both of our waters have been empty for a good    minutes  Once we finally got our servers attention  she was annoyed when we explained to here that the wedges were cold  During this time  the table in front of us was complaining to the manager about their food taking a long time  and the manager was a complete jerk about it to them  Both my fiance and I are servers and we have never witnessed worse customer service  The manager was rude and condescending and told the table that they were lying about their food taking a long time  and said  What do you want me to do about it    For this reason  we chose not to speak with the manager because of how rude we saw him being  We then asked our server  who we have seen only   times all night to box up our food  because we just wanted to leave    Worst service I have ever experienced  I will never go back  I cannot believe a place with this reputation allows their management to treat customers so badly  My fiance and I have friends who live in Las Vegas and we travel here at least once a year  With food that is this good  it is a shame to ruin it with such rude and negligent customer service ,1,2014-05-01
We were pleased that our table for    was ready early as we all arrived at different times  Our server was friendly and helpful  I ordered the lobster rolls which were good but the coleslaw that came with it lacked flavor and was not good   My husband ordered the shepherds pie as found it to have grease on the bottom and lacked seasoning  Over all the food was not what we expected and were a bit disappointed ,3,2015-02-14
    lb of thinly shaved prime rib goodness  sour dough bread to die for  and au jus done perfectly   I think I m in love   We also sampled the Dirty Chips    very rich and filling  plan on skipping dinner after these   This was a fun restaurant pub just outside of the Aria Resort   It s impossible to pass by and not want to join in the atmosphere   Lots of great choices on the menu and plenty of beers to choose from   I especially enjoyed the bar table tops that have the self serve keg draw on it   That could be trouble ,5,2012-02-19
So over priced and so overrated  A beer    bucks  a bland tasting Bloody Mary        I realize this is the strip but please  There are too many great restaurants with reasonably priced     And by reasonably priced I mean   to   bucks  I can get a better tasting BM at the bar for free   Sorry TE you have a great menu but your prices are over the top   I will never return ,2,2016-07-21
One of my most favorite places to come in Vegas it s part of the  Aria City center   Always packed   always loud  and always plenty of beer to choose from   I almost always order the prime beef with blue cheese fondue but in a place like this you can t go wrong ,4,2014-05-01
Listened to Yelp and you were right  The lobster roll was great   We came here for a late dinner to make it for happy hour  Great specials   We got    oysters and    dollar beers if I remember correctly  Great food and I highly recommend for a semi casual dinner in the heart of city center ,4,2012-08-02
Fun environment  the fried pickles were yummy    But the salad was overpriced and the server was unfriendly ,3,2013-08-03
My wife and I decided celebrate our   th Anniversary in Vegas  getting remarried by Elvis  and looking forward to a great time with family and friends   After looking at several options for holding an informal reception  we came across the PUB   Obviously being from out of town  and not being able to actually see experience the venue beforehand  was a big concern   Upon our arrival we decided to stop by and see what the place was like   As you may imagine the place is typically  English Pub  d cor  but with the added grandiose Vegas touch  exceptionally well kept  clean  and omitting the dark grubby British aspects  not a bad thing    The General Manager  John Lanata  graciously met with us and spent a great deal of his time providing assistance and making sure that all of our questions were answered   He also invited us to try the menu for lunch  to which we were not disappointed   I ordered the Lobster rolls while my wife requested the daily special  a Turkey club   Both items were absolutely exceptional  see attached    I am a huge lobster fan and this did not disappoint   There was plenty of meat  butter  and seasoned just right  complementing and not obscuring one of natures more subtle flavors   My wife s selection was also exceptional  see attached  moist and tender  with smoked bacon that was pretty amazing     The bar has an great selection of beer  wine  and hard spirits  particularly Bourbon  many of which have been personally selected from small Distiller s that I never even knew existed      Perhaps the most important aspect of our visit were the people working there    Everyone was polite  friendly  and ready to help  Exactly as it should be in Vegas    Mr  Lanata  was obviously involved with his staff and took the time to speak with them often   For our Reception  We had the game area set aside for our guests with Hors D oeuvres  Well    beer  and wine drinks   The game area also has self serve draught beer handles  which several of our guest enjoyed   This small area was perfect for us as it easily held our small party      persons  on an intimate level  but at the same time keeping us within the public atmosphere of room   It was a really nice casual setting  perfect for our needs   The wait staff were extremely attentive  providing us  with plenty of Hors D oeuvres and drinks at all times   All of the Hors D oeuvres were fantastic  Pot Stickers  Ahi Tuna  Shrimp Skewers  Sliders  and Brie and Bacon sandwiches   Overall  if you are looking for a fun  casual setting in Vegas you would be hard pressed to do better   I cannot say enough good things about Mr  Lanata and his staff   We had a great time and I would strongly recommend Todd s P U B to anyone looking for a great place for a great party ,5,2014-07-27
Terrific food  excellent service  great selection of beers    running out of superlatives here     I recommend the carved prime beef  on a toasted English muffin  with black truffle mayo   It was exquisite   You can order the     pound option and there will still be enough meat for two sandwiches  just ask for another muffin   they brought us one for free    The fries were perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned   The ambiance is less pubby than  say  Nine Fine Irishmen over in NYNY   and more upscale  like the other Aria restaurants   Expect to pay a bit more  too   The two of us were seated right away on a late Thursday evening  in a nice booth at our request ,4,2010-04-05
Cool restaurant atmosphere and tasty food  I like the option to build your own sandwich with bread  meat  sauces and side  You ll definitely be able to make a combination that suits your tastes ,4,2012-11-18
I loved the choices of beer  They have some harder to find beer from around the world  The PUB food during happy hour was tasty  The bartenders were fun and friendly  It s a little out of the way and harder to find but definitely worth it  I would definitely return ,4,2015-06-27
A couple of things I dig about this place      free peanuts and you throw the shells on the floor     beer cocktails     good selection of beers on tap   lots of brit beers on tap  and speciality beers by the bottle    hell yes     waitresses have the coyote ulgy thing going on   Unfortunatly we didn t get to eat   Making a point of returning based on the reviews ,4,2011-05-03
This place has a fun atmosphere and decent happy hour prices  The food isn t a steal but the servers are friendly and clearly enjoy working there  The have a couple fun things that I have not seen at a restaurant before  You can sit at a table near the bar and have your own beer taps at the table that just keep track of how much you have had to drink  They also have some hourglass timers at the bar that if you can finish a beer in less than   seconds its free  up to two beers   If you are chosing between slightly overpriced and generic spots to grab a drink this one tops the rest ,3,2014-02-11
LOVE it   They have   pub height tables that have their own taps  They were taken so I was so jealous     With their signature P U B  brew  They give you popcorn in a tin bucket  powdered with blue cheese  so I was quickly appeased  The mussels were amazing in a tomato base and I have got to learn how to make thin crostinis at home  The in house made potato chips are amazing    If you check in here at yelp  you get a free pint of bud light     Yeah YELPERS   ,5,2013-04-19
a super nice place that is exactly what you d expect in this location   i m sure plenty of money went into building the place   the food is terrific and the beer selection is great   a very large space that contains a huge rectangular bar with seating on each side nice stools  bar    bar back   bartenders were social and quick  though the bar was mostly empty   an easy stop for someone looking for a few beers or for a large group wanting the same ,4,2014-11-28
Eh    food is just ok  One of the more affordable restaurants located at Crystals but still    it s pricey for what you really get   Came here for a quick lunch on a Monday  Labor Day weekend  We ordered the chicken pot stickers as our appetizer  It was     but it only came with   pieces  What the         That s it  We ordered salads for our entrees cuz damn    we needed something healthy after   days of eatin  like a tourist  My boyfriend ordered the iceberg wedge salad     and I ordered a chicken cesar salad       added chicken for     Wait   so you re telling me it cost     for a normal chicken cesar salad   WOW          That s sad  I guess in order for you to be  healthy   you gotta cough up some cash  He enjoyed his wedge salad but I thought mine was just ok   Burgers and sliders can range anywhere from         Chicken and waffles were      Fish and chips were       ouch    There are plenty of other restaurants on The Strip that s a better bang for your buck  This is def a no go for me in the future ,3,2015-09-09
Terrific service    waiter provided great recommendations when we couldn t really choose what we wanted off the menu   Casual environment but even those a little dressy fit in   right in between Aria and Crystals at City Center     great location ,4,2012-08-01
At first  I thought Todd s PUB was part of Aria hotel but then I later realized it s actually located inside the Crystals Mall   We were craving some good lunch pub food so why not go to a pub   I ve heard so much about the   second beer challenge that I was hoping on our visit to see some thirsty challengers   No challenges happened but we did order some food  Even on a lunch  the restaurant is pretty packed but we only waited a couple of minutes to get our table ready  Upon suggestion  I decided to try their lobster roll whole the bf ordered their fish and chips   When they say fish and chips  literally expect A FISH and some chips  Granted it was a huge piece of deep fries fish  but it was kinda sad to see just one fish on the plate  The fish and chips were good  But nothing too spectacular  I thoroughly enjoyed the lobster roll  I thought t was way worth getting the lobster roll than the fish and chips  You get   mini rolls with some cole slaw and chips  The lobster roll had some food chunks of lobster in them as well    We left full and satisfied  Will we come back again  Maybe  It s a little on the pricier side  For   lunch entrees and   drinks it came out to be about      for the   of us  But then again  it s Vegas so what do you expect right ,3,2014-09-05
Was not impressed with this place   I had the pastrami reuben and the meat was stringy   chewy   I ve had better ruebens at sports bars for half of what they charge here   My wife had pork belly sliders and it was very fatty and not very flavorful   The fries were good but everything else was disappointing  especially for the prices ,2,2016-03-22
We only drank here because we were eating at Sage  We only had one beer each because this place was very pricey  We had three Bosteele  a Fat tire and a sampler and the cost was almost        They do have a raw bar  Which seemed fresh  The bartender was good  not pushy and was patient with our order    If you have another choice of places to drink  go there  The PUB is a bit overrated ,2,2010-06-07
I m surprised at the other reviews because my friends and I loved this place  We came   times during our   night    day stay at the Aria  We loved it because its a casual restaurant that makes pub food taste and look gourmet  Considering it is Vegas  the price is a lot more reasonably priced than many other establishments in the area  unless you go to Fat Burger or Denny s    I ordered the sliders with skinny fries  The burgers were cooked perfect  just the way i like it  The fries were addicting  especially dipped with Todd English ketchup  Lets talk about the dessert     BREAD PUDDING  OMG  so good  its dangerous  Our waiter recommended it and im glad he did  The other times there  I have tasted the West Coast burger  dirty chips and their wings  all amazing  The mac and cheese howeverm deserves its own recognition  Simply delicious  cheesy and sinful  The small side dish is enough considering how decadent it is ,5,2010-11-02
Well you re in Vegas  so unless you re prepared to get far off the strip you re going to pay a premium for what elsewhere would be be considered mediocre fare   Todd English P U B  is a case in point  spacious and comfortable  with decent food at grossly inflated prices for what it is   Vegas is the home for routine food with the added twist of a  name  chef  and a corresponding  unwarranted  hike in price   Beer selection is fairly expansive but rotating handles are unbelievably poorly described  this is a gastropub after all  and our waitress really had no clue about any of them    The menu describes the  permanent  offerings adequately    The food is fine  the service is OK  the rotating beers are a mystery until you order them  and the prices are horribly inflated   Overall an OK experience once you get over the Vegas sticker shock ,3,2016-10-06
Visited this spot after Zarkana last month since it was close by  The restaurant had a dark ambiance  Low light and upscale looking  It was pretty empty  bright spot it was happy hour tho   pm to closing   All I had was a couple sliders since I wasn t too hungry from my late lunch previously in the day  They were good  not as good as the kobe sliders at Bacchanal but ok  Nothing too memorable about the experience  Waitress seemed in a bit of a rush to take our order since she didn t seem to want to  or didn t think we needed much explaining on the regular or happy hour menu  It s definitely not a cheap place to eat  But I know to expect that dining on the strip  Even with some of our items being happy hour specials  it still came out to around      for    Not sure if I d revisit  but it would be an ok option if I was near it and hungry ,3,2013-10-10
The Chicken Pot Pie is best thing on the menu  Every time we visit Vegas we always have to make a pit stop here for the pot pie  The service is pretty good here as well too ,5,2011-10-06
Where do I even start   I LOVED this place  There were plenty of beer options on tap and the bartenders helped pick out a great beer  or two actually that fit my tastes   We came for lunch and had the potato chip  truffle and bleu cheese appetizer  It was so incredible that I swore off potato chips  I don t think any other will ever be able to compare   We then split the sliders and the beef brisket  The sliders and fries were also very very good  but I prefered the beef brisket  I ordered it with the mini  rolls  and my sauces were the bleu cheese fondue and the TE BBQ  Both were super yum  The brisket was cooked perfectly and was a big portion  If we weren t sharing things  we would never have finished   Give it a chance  I thought it was wonderful and am sad I only go to Vegas once a year to get to enjoy this ,5,2010-03-13
Cool pub atmosphere and good beer  Food is very tasty and the bartenders give great suggestions for the beers  The only bad thing is beers are pricey  but you can t beat the atmosphere ,4,2015-12-20
Um the service wasn t much to my liking  It took us forever to find our waiter to order our food  Aside from that the food was nice and the ambiance was very open  airy  and sporty      Food   Brown Butter Lobster Roll  It is a very hearty and soulful roll of lobster and it comes with some cole slaw and kettle chips  I really did not like the cole slaw  The rolls were okay but nothing special  I think the one inside Planet Hollywood is better in my opinion  Overall a decent place to eat but the food is all pretty heavy ,3,2016-08-03
Very friendly staff everyone was super nov and took are of our every need   very welcoming and made us feel good   Our server Lindsey was amazing and made sure we were well taken care of   the sliders were good   and the Bloody Mary was also good  They make their own mix only thing I didn t like was the bathroom attendant she was very nice but I always feel weird w bathroom attendants I feel I have to pay them and I didn t have cash on me   Overall tho food experience oh and u get a free beer for checking in,4,2014-08-24
Super inconsistent  Staff acts annoyed by patrons who show up during their nebulous happy hour  Hey wads      pm until     indicates infinity  It means you always have a happy hour and never fucking close  Fire your director of communications  Just because you have a raw bar and shitty Belgium beer doesn t validate your existence  Stop being pretentious turds and post some fucking hours that you adhere too    Their claim to fame is a broad tap list that will underwhelm the most neophyte beer fan     percent of their offerings are found at my local Von s  Fire everyone involved with bringing good beer to this place   The  already burnt out by Vegas  moved in a year ago  and ready to shower you in sass  bartender informed us their English muffins are store bought crap    Cool that they have drinking contests  Open a spot in Tempe    Clearly a short lived experiment  Sad and replaceable  The Alabama satellite campus confirms how pathetic the concept is for Vegas  Expect this place to be gone within a year ,2,2016-08-25
No wait to be seated  wait staff was on it and friendly  Great atmosphere  Food was above average  but a little off here and there  Husband got meatloaf and it was excellent  but they put a very spicy and tangy bbq sauce all over it  Lobster rolls were very good but the sauce was too much and too salty ,4,2015-05-26
This review is for when my husband and I were there on New Year s Eve  So  I don t know if this is how it normally is   It s a fun atmosphere  the decorations are fun  and they some of the tables have the opinion of pulling your own beers pretty cool concept   They also do a think were if you can chugg a beer in under   mins   they pay for the beer  stipulations apply I m sure  but people were doing it that night   The service was     they were kind of pushy and not very friendly    And I wasn t impressed with the price  We got two beers  and the dirty chips  The bill was    dollars  That seems unjustifiably  high to me    Won t be back  Too many good places to try to bother returning to overpriced and mediocre ,2,2014-01-17
Food is good and servings are large  The huge sandwich is a deal if there are   or   of you that can agree at         Also be aware there is a seven second beer chugging challenge  If you complete the beer in   seconds its free  Can be a scene  crowded on evening weekends  low key on week days for lunch ,4,2011-06-29
Todd English has some great food    this place in Vegas is no exception   Because it was convenient I ate there a couple of times   Its not Olives but has great burgers and sandwiches   I ate the tuna burger   It was great   I got rid of the bun most of the way through and focused on the rest of the  burger  and dressings   The fries were a bit crisp   If that was not intended  a bit of QC might be added to the kitchen   Because of TE s other places like Olives  I was excited to try the pickles they brine on site   They were OK   Nothing to rave about   expected a bit more   Be sure to see that you can get a free beer if you check in on Yelp there     Another time I had a Pastrami sandwich   They said they make the pastrami on site   It was really good   I asked if it was big   they said it was New York deli sandwich big   Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches at Jewish delis in NYC are often   inches tall   That was what I was hoping for   In fact  I was on my way to Carnagie Deli in Vegas until I saw that TE had the pastrami and the waitress said it was NYC big   It was more like Applebe s big   Very tasty but not   inches tall   Its a very good restaurant   I would walk a mile and make a reservation to go to Olives   I would walk through the lobby to go to PUB   Hope you enjoy ,4,2015-10-23
Average Vegas food   Not much to write about here     They have some decent beers here  but the brunch here is quite lackluster   They should just stick with their sandwiches  which are decent if you stick with pastrami and their roast beef     The service here is also a bit depressed  and lacking in energy   You can do better in Vegas   Come here for a beer at best ,3,2014-08-24
One of my favorite places along the strip   A large beer menu is available  along with a wide assortment of other cordials and wines   Traditional British fare is offered  including bangers and mash   I selected the fish and chips   This entree comes with mint and pea slaw  along with tartar sauce and fries  natch    The fries are thicker and tossed with sea salt   Slaw has a nice balance of ingredients  nothing overwhelmed the other   Fish is fried perfectly  and large pieces to boot   Bar staff was friendly and accommodating   I also ended up with a free beer  it was plenty busy between a new trainee and vendors making deliveries   I left him     ,5,2017-07-19
I probably wont be coming back here for their raw bar  but they make a pretty fantastic bloody mary  We ordered a dozen oysters from the oyster bar but they came out very dirty and not shucked well  When I asked the waiter where the oysters were from  he answered  the ocean    I normally would ve found this answer amusing  if he wasn t dead serious and couldn t comprehend the idea that I was asking for the region  But I guess at    per oyster you get what you pay for  We ended up not eating most of them   We each ordered a deconstructed sandwich  I had the duck which was not bad and my friend had the lamb  which to me was pretty gamey  tho my friend didn t think so   The place has a large beer selection with a full bar as well  I had them make my spicy bloody mary with top shelf vodka and it was probably the best I ve had  Although  it came out to about     for the drink  My friend just had a vodka on the rocks  That being said our bill came out to about     total for the dozen oysters  two drinks and two sandwiches   I doubt I d go back for a meal but may make a pit stop to catch a drink ,3,2013-05-08
When it first opened in       I visited at least twice  with different friends  And I distinctly remember that we all enjoyed it  The atmosphere  the food  the beer selection  I know there were a couple other times I had the intention of going  but decided on other restaurants in City Center or Aria  It was good  not amazing  and not enough to compete with new restaurants and bars popping up in the last three years with similar menus and or themes   I know a lot of people say this and it s a tad clich   but I really wanted to like this place again  My brother  Marcus L   fianc   Teresa S   and I were leaving Zarkana and decided to stay in City Center to eat avoid traffic  Since I was the only one in the group to have been to PUB  it seemed to be the perfect spot  We were seated right away and pleasantly surprised that we were there for the start of Happy Hour  their second Happy Hour is   pm to closing daily   It features    Chicken Wings     Oysters     Sliders  and     off pint draft beers and glasses by the wine  We decided on    sliders and an order of Waffle Fries      for the group  My fianc  and I both ordered a pint of Fr li Strawberry beer     during H H  while I got a Caesar Salad       and he got Bangers   Mash          The service was   interesting  We weren t entirely pleased  but fortunately  it wasn t horrible  It was just odd  Our server just assumed we knew what Happy Hour entailed  to our defense  the little     paper doesn t explain details  so we were forced to ask multiple questions and follow up questions  Which would have been fine  but after answering one question  the server would immediately say   I can come back if you need more time   leaving us with   Um  um  well  uh  and trying to quickly phrase our next question  It was so uncomfortable  But  other than our ordering experience  the service was good throughout the meal  The person who brought out the food was really nice and our server came to check on us three times   The food was extremely prompt  so that was great  The Sliders were only shrug worthy  They were flavorless with a sad amount of caramelized onions  some seeming almost non existent  and barely enough Thousand Island dressing  Also  only some of our order were cooked Medium Rare  like we requested  The Waffle Fries were delicious  but I can t give a restaurant much credit for something that came out of a bag box then fried  especially at     My Caesar Salad was decent  didn t love the dressing   but made me extremely sad having paid     for the small bowl  Not worth it AT ALL  The Bangers   Mash were just okay as well  The sausages were okay  but the mash was weird  It had large chucks of potatoes on the bottom that resembled a kind of hash  then a small amount of mashed potatoes on top of it  then the gravy and sausages  The description doesn t describe the potato chucks  so perhaps it was an odd part of the gravy  So  mysterious substandard potatoes that took away from the dish  got it  No one was really impressed   Our bill was just under       tax and tip included   ouch  When you consider the type of eateries in the valley that serve superior tastes at much lower prices  it s hard to consider this worthwhile   As for the Happy Hour deals  I m not sure if the wings are truly cheaper than a regular order and the oysters are EXACTLY the same price you d pay outside H H  it doesn t even leave anything to the imagination because the menu literally says    each   And the sliders are basically the same price as the regular order  unless you don t want fries  the regular order       comes with three sliders and skinny fries     as a side order   Stick to the     priced draft pints and eat somewhere else ,2,2013-09-06
This place is awesome   My husband and I went to Vegas a few weeks ago and our waiter from our hotel in the Mandalay suggested we try this place out  So we go the next day and man oh man did we enjoy ourselves  We got there at       am and left after     pm  We had such a great time sitting at the bar  Janelle  Javier Jared and Dat made our experience so much fun that we didn t want to leave  They were so personable and attentive  The drinks are awesome and they have great specialty beers  We ordered the chicken wings  macaroni and nachos and it was all delicious  I love the vibes of this place    Coming here was the highlight of our trip  We booked another trip to Vegas in June and we are excited to come back here ,5,2015-03-06
Great beer choices  Had the sliders  and they were surprisingly good   We went with a large group and they were able to handle us with no problem   We were there celebrating a birthday and they brought her out a cookie ice cream sandwich  Very good   On future trips to Vegas we will try to stop by ,4,2015-08-21
Todd English s P U B  was a fun experience that my friends and I made sure we had while we were in Vegas  Known for it s   second beer challenge  I d say this place has a good bit more to offer other than chugging cheap beer   The pub has a fairly extensive beer menu that will accommodate even the most picky beer drinkers  me   I m not a huge fan of beer in general  but I was able to find a couple things I enjoyed after checking out the menu  The bartenders were helpful and were fun to interact with while doing the   second chug    We sat outside which was awesome in January  Our server was a cheery lady so that was good  I got the pretzels with cheese and they were damn good  My friends got a couple orders of the west coast oysters and they were raving about them so I gotta recommend those as they are less than   days removed from the ocean when they hit your table    This is a fun stop if you re in Vegas if you want to experience a little bit of Todd English ,4,2016-01-26
 My mothers   th birthday pre celebration on        I love this place  Been here multiple times  Located directly next to the Aria lobby  Great hotel by the way  I will leave a seperate review for them  Great food and a wide selection of beers wines  Their house specialty if fish and chips which my mother had and she loved it  I stuck to the happy hour specials  Everyday        wings    sliders half price beers and wines   I thouroughly enjoyed it  Great envirement if you want to catch a game  Multiple tvs  Well done  Service was hit and miss  Our server Tony or Robert  check had Robert on it but I believe he told us his name was Tony  was really good  Showed a real passion for his job  On the other hand the hostess that seated us around      on      seemed extremeley  disinterested  and that is being kind to this lady   Will,4,2016-12-06
Todd English s Public Urban Bar is located at the City Center Aria Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas   For years I have wanted to go to a Todd English place in Vegas   he has three of them  and so this vacation my wife  Simone and i did   The first problem I had was actually finding the entrance  You can see the place from the inside of Aria but the only entrance that i could find was from the outside walkway  At any rate  when we got to the P U B  the place was rather large and it was packed full of people  our waitress was able to squeeze us in at a table once again right beside the restrooms  this always happens to me   While I took advantage of being so close to the crapper Simone took a look at the menus  The P U B features an open kitchen so you can watch the chefs making the food  This is always a good thing as it helps pass the time while you wait for your meal and also gives you a good indication of the quality of the place  The menu is extensive with a complete carvery menu for those meat lovers that includes turkey  beef  duck  chicken and more  Also a raw bar and many grill choices  Simone and I started with an appetizer called Duck Buns   These were extra large Hoison shredded Duck filled steamed dumplings  They were topped with scallions and served with Ailoi for dipping  They were pillowey and soft on the outside and the duck overflowing from them was steaming hot and tender  They were a very good start to our meal   Next up were the entrees  Simones choice was  of course  a salad  The chopped Salad to be exact  and that is what it looked like when it arrived   A bunch of vegetables and lettuce  chopped with dressing  Simone liked it  I didn t bother to even take a picture  that s how excited it made me  but i suppose its hard to make a bunch of rabbit food all that special  Perhaps stupidly so  I went a bit more adventurous with my meal  I went for the Brown Bag Lunch  Artisan Bologna Sandwich on simple white bread with melted cheese and Mayo and a side of chips   I have not had Bologna in years and about   hours later  I would remember why  but i digress  The Bologna was sliced thin and grilled until the edges were crispy then served on white bread with melted Swiss   When it arrived at the table it looked kinda pornographic but I dug in anyway  It was definitely artisan and homemade  not your lunch meat variety Bologna  It was kicking with lots of spice and garlic  Good  but perhaps to spicy for my already pickled stomach after a week long battle with gluttony in the City of Vegas   Being the trooper that I am  I pushed through and finished the entire sandwich and then of course had to move on to the dessert menu   We went with the Mona Resee dessert option  basically it was a tasting plate that included homemade Twinkies  a cupcake  red velvet cake  a cookie and even some cookie dough  Simone and I both enjoyed this and Simone took some with her for the rest of her late night chocolate fixes  But this is not where this review ends   as mentioned earlier   I feel the need to share with you the aftermath of my meal choice    The Bologna bit me back  at around midnight  The word Fire comes to mind  Not just your average heartburn situation  this burned EVERYWHERE  And it hung on  Three Zantacs  and a night of getting to know my hotel throne and Todd English and his meat were still with me  It took me almost the next twenty four hours to feel well again and it made for a rather rough last day in Vegas   sorry to the hotel janitorial staff   I wish I could honestly say that I will not hold it against the P U B  but I probably will  I can tell you for a fact my Bologna days are over   Even doing this review today my stomach turns just a bit at the memory   Maybe someday I will go back to the P U B   but who knows  Sorry Todd  I so wanted to love your new place    but it stayed with me for way to long  Thanks for the memories   Two stars for the PUB    ,2,2012-03-14
This is a great spot for happy hour  They have great beer specials and an extensive beer menu that will make any beer lover smile  And if you think you have what it takes to slam beer like a pro you can take the challenge at the bar race and against the mini hour glass to win a free pint  I have actually witnessed a girl who won three in a row ,4,2014-05-29
When I goto Vegas  I have to stop by the pub and have my lobster rolls  With all the fine eateries in Vegas  this is one of my favs  Great food and atmosphere ,5,2013-06-09
I have seen a Youtube video about their        bloody mary   and I am a bloody mary fanatic  Wife and I met my son and his new girlfriend here for brunch and all of us were terribly disappointed   The Bloody Mary comes with a ton of stuff   celery  pickled beans and asparagus  a regular pickle  a bacon slider  a large shrimp  cheese  pickle  a couple of chicken wings  etc  The slider was dry  the asparagus was one of those overly thick pieces that were tough to chew  the bloody mary wasn t spicy and didn t have much vodka  The chicken wings were the star so we ordered a   additional orders   which never showed up  Waitress was truly asleep at the wheel   Wife ordered a Cobb Salad   impossible to screw up  Son s girlfriend ordered Fish and Chips which were greasy  we ordered some kind of Potato Chip   Beef Ragu thingy   which was pretty tasty until it got cold and then turned into a slimy mess   All in all  this was an epic fail ,2,2017-06-25
Came here after we check in aria  Nice pub  The staff was very friendly  They give you popcorn before ordering So I started with a flight of beers  then I had the lobster roll  Omg the lobster roll just melts in your mouth  I believe it s the best I ever had ,4,2017-01-13
We came here to unwind before the masses come over for  th of July weekend  I ve walked by this place for years but this is the first time venturing in  Everything was perfect  They serve my favorite beer here  Blanche de Bruselles   The Prime Rotisserie was tender and delicious  We ll be back      June        Sorry  taking one star away for inconsistencies in their food    July       Love your St  Bernardus Beer and your oysters ,4,2015-07-01
Do not order the fish and chips  yuck  There was one sliver of fish which was like jerky and the rest was greasy batter  The place was over the top noisy  I would not go to this place again ,1,2013-11-12
OK  first rule when you re sitting at the bar here  Throw the peanut shells on the floor  not on the bar   You ll thank me later for this    I was at a highly technical conference that was held at Planet Hollywood  where else   and had a couple of nights on my own  First night  I wanted to see Monday Night Football at a bar and  after Yelp consultation  ended up at PUB  It was great  I had a well made Manhattan to start and some sort of exotic beer with my lobster rolls  The lobster rolls were excellent   lots of big chunks of lobster with brown butter on three slider rolls  The next night  I went back and had the tuna burger  Again  a fantastic burger with lots of rare tuna and some wasabi oriented sauce that was just perfect with it  I sat at the bar the second night as well  Only down side was that the bartenders seem very busy and you might sit a moment waiting for another drink  It s also a pretty noisy place  so don t go here for a romantic meal  Prices are a bit high  but unlike a lot of places on the Strip you won t walk out feeling ripped off as the quality of the food is very high ,4,2012-10-04
Always fabulous service and of course amazing oysters  Never thought in Vegas I would go to the same place multiple nights yet we always find ourself here more than once each trip  Atmosphere is great as well ,5,2017-01-22
Good beer selection and pretty descent food  The happy hour prices were good for Vegas ,3,2015-02-01
The ambiance  beer selection and staff were wonderful  The beer price is steep   I didn t try the food  A fun place to kill several hours watching the Olympics  I will be back to try the food menu and continue drinking my way through the beer menu ,3,2012-08-06
Good place   Prices seem just a little high at first  but once you see the size of the portions  all is understood   Splitting things is definitely recommended   Good manhattans  loved the dirty chips appetizer   Sadly out of the lobster roll  so I went with a plain pastrami selection with rye bread that was really good   Juicy flavorful pastrami without too much saltiness   The other sammich selection was a grilled bologna that was quite tasty as well   We definitely should have split one of the entrees though   those dirty chips fill you up   And  service was very good   it was busy as poo due to the world cup and nickle PBR night  yet everyone from hostesses to waitstaff was friendly and attentive ,4,2010-06-24
Good drink selection and service   The a prime Rib Chili was good  not great   If it were chunky style   with someway to tell he meat was actually prime rib  it would have been better   Campbell s Chunky Steak chili is as good  if not better  Overall  a good experience ,4,2014-05-07
Came here with my boss on a work trip  Great ambiance and aesthetically pleasing  When you walk in there is an open seafood bar   Raw Bar   some bar tables with taps built right into them  and a big selection of food  My boss and I each had yummy salads  The prices were reasonable  considering the town we were in  Very convenient location in the hotel  I loved the customer service  she wasn t snobby or pretentious  she seem happy and willing to help ,3,2013-08-05
We got a complimentary Corona lite thanks to the Yelp  Check in   Score   Our server was really nice and made me laugh which is always a bonus   The food here was just ok   The pretzel sticks were warm and buttery  but old and slightly stale on the inside  I wasn t blown away with by sliders  the buns were burnt  and the Lobster Cobb came with raw onions after we requested no onions   Still ok  but we weren t blown away   A good casual option at Aria since there aren t many casual options there   My advice  Go for the beer and or happy hour and stick with fish chips ,3,2015-08-02
Happy Hour on A Friday  Parking    There is always parking at the various self parking lots at Aria or Monte Carlo    Establishment    Decor was pretty standard for a bar  Service was a pretty slow  My favorite were the quotes on the place mat such as  I feel sorry for people who don t drink  When they wake up in the morning  that s as good as they re going to feel all day   Frank Sinatra     stars   Food   Was there for Happy Hour and had the chicken wings which I consider just buffalo wings for    each nothing special but I hate when places serve chicken wings covered in buffalo sauce  Just call them buffalo wings please     stars   Also the beer was worth the money during happy hour since it was half off pints and wine glasses  They have a very extensive beer list for whatever you desire  I had Oskar Blues Dale s Pale which was enjoyable  You could get a cheap beer like PBR or Bud Light for           stars   Had the Roasted Chicken Pot Pie what made it stand out was instead of using a flaky pie crust they used a huge cheddar biscuit which was good because it soaked up the veloute but unfortunately the meal was just that a biscuit soaked in veloute with very little chicken and vegetables and for         stars   Overall   I feel the price point for this place is rather high for the food  Yes the portions are appropriately sized but I feel there was a lack of content  May give it another try just because there was a   second chug challenge at the bar which sounds interesting ,2,2014-12-20
Would have been five stars for us if they hadn t lost our reservations   Rude never works    To the restaurants credit they were able to accommodate our group of eleven  This was the best dinner we had in Vegas and I want to go back  Fresh oysters  fish and chips and my favorite Hangar   vodka  Thanks to manager to help us feel welcome  That s points ,4,2014-10-14
Nine Irish Men in New  York   NY is much better  Todds is a bit gimmicky and the food is not good   My wife and i ordered roast beef sliders  the bread was old and stale  the roast beef was average and the mystery cheese sauce was just that  a mystery   don t go here  go to Nine Irish men instead ,2,2010-11-04
Don t do the breakfast  Not sure how the rest of the food is but the breakfast egg sandwich was buttery and globbed with cheese  The mimosas came after our food and the waitress wasn t that amazing  Just no  Won t be back ,2,2015-07-26
Food was good but can t get past the     beers  Oh  go to  happy hour  and enjoy half off  thanks Todd ,3,2016-08-03
These was my third trip to Todd English PUB over the last   years  and the first with my wife  as opposed to only my guy friends   arguably it was our best meal of the entire trip   We had two couples dining  and were seated immediately by pleasant host staff fairly early on a Thursday night  before the place was really busy   We had water to our table within   minutes  and a server who was covering for our server started a drink order for us    The cocktails were very good   They have a very refreshing margarita with cucumber  which is made all the better by the fact that it is NOT syrupy sweet   They have a HUGE beer selection  and suffice it to say we were all feeling no pain after our first round   The menu is loaded with options  but we went mostly with comfort food including an excellent shepherd s pie and chicken pot pie  as well as very good salads  chicken parmigian sliders  and more drinks   My wife tried several of the oysters from the raw bar  and said they were excellent   Our server was well versed in the menu  wine and beer list  etc  and attentive without being intrusive   Towards the end of the meal the restaurant was definitely filling up and noticeably louder   Overall  an very good experience with good service  great bar  and very good food ,4,2012-02-04
Great vibe  and great sounding beer list  but      As soon as we sat down  nice atmosphere  by the way   the waitress breathlessly told us that they had          beers on tap   Only    they only had one of seven seasonal beers   O kaaaayyyyy     so I guess that means they have    beers  How about      Nope   The next half dozen choices we came up with  they didn t have   So in actuality they had AT THE MOST    beers   Our problem was that the rest of the beers we could choose from we had already had  or they were IPAs  and that s a beer designed by people who hate beer   and we wanted to try something new   The waitress was very apologetic  and we finally found one we could live with    We only ordered an appetizer  the dirty chips   Tasty  and even if you think you don t like chicken livers  don t worry    they re fried and don t taste much like liver  and there s only four pieces around the side  so you don t even have to eat them if you don t want to   At some point someone whom I assume was the manager came over to apologize for the lack of beers  I THINK he said something about changing the beers and menu hadn t changed yet        but he also did something that turned this from a slam review to a  you know  I d go there again  and tell people to try it out    He comped the beers we had  and asked if we would like to try something else   We thanked him and told him there wasn t anything else we wanted to taste   But he came up with a Belgian that sounded good    but instead of the little tastes we thought he d bring over  he came with two full sized glasses  it was a tasty beer  too    which were also comped   Things go wrong sometimes  but how you handle it makes all the difference   This was deft handling   I say try the place out   It s a great place for a little bit of food  some good beer  and great vibe ,3,2012-01-31
Unfortunately this place is a typical strip restaurant   Lots of flash  but very little substance and poor value     By flash I mean it is a loud and party atmosphere   Lots of beautiful people from nearby Aria  low cut dresses and stilleto heels   Unfortunately I was sitting with my back to the bar area so I didn t get to enjoy the views   I did  however  get the chance to try their curry moules et frites and the sweet potato fries   The mussels smelled great with a heavy curry scent wafting up from the small cast iron pot   There were about       small mussels in a curried stock drizzled with mayonaise and parsley   I am not sure why they put maynaise on it  since it did not add to the flavor or richness of the broth   They might have been trying to be European  but then why the curry flavor   Anyway  the real let down with the dish was that no bread came with it   Our waitress was nice enough to bring me a few slices of sourdough  but you think it would have been included with the dish   The fries were thin cut fries that were a little dry and not thick enough to soak up the soup inside the pot   The sweet potato fries looked and smelled promising  but they were just too salty   If you got one that didn t have any salt on it  then they were great   Service was great  my ice tea was almost never empty   If you are looking for atmosphere  beautiful people  to pay for Todd s high rent at this place through mediocre food then this is the place for you   Otherwise there are better pub bar deli type establishments around ,2,2010-08-30
The food ran from good to excellent  The best was the Shepherd s Pie  you have to like cheese  there s a lot of it melted over the top  and the Bubbles and Squeak   The prime rib chili was okay   My complaint  the meat was ground  so it was close to a ground beef chili which is substandard to me   Onion rings were good  you get six really hefty o rings   My biggest complaint  the beer       for a small glass of an average import   Rediculous   Thankfully  we were comp d ,4,2017-01-30
We went here for dinner on a Saturday night after a long day of gambling and laying out in the pool  I know  such a hard life we have   They seated us right away  we were expecting to have to wait   and our waiter  Alex  came to us within the first   minutes of being seated  This pub is awesome  for all you beer loving drinkers  they carry about    different types of beer on tap and have a pretty large list of wines as well   I had the bison burger  my boyfriend had the chicken roasted pot pie and our friends had a shepards pie and the swordfish enchiladas  The bison burger was really good  it had the perfect amount of blue cheese and spice  The burger had a kick and it was so good and perfectly cooked  The chicken pot pie was really good as well  My boyfriend said that the vegetables were really fresh  It was well balanced and the chicken was cooked just perfectly  The swordfish enchiladas were yummy and the fish was very fresh  the salsa was homemade and flavorful  The shepards pie did not disappoint either  The mash potatoes were creamy and the flavor was excellent  We ended up having to wait for our food a bit longer  and we thought it was standard because we had ordered items that would take a while to make   but our waiter had told the manager about it and she came by  apologized for the wait  it really wasn t long at all  and offered to have us pick out drinks on the house  That is stellar customer service   We will definitely be coming back here whenever we visit Vegas ,5,2011-07-11
Great craft beer selection and knowledgeable servers  Didn t try the food  but it looked good ,4,2015-05-20
I ve always sat at the bar  Selection of drinks is good in my opinion  Bartenders have always been nice ,4,2013-03-04
Chocolate covered strawberry     beer   Yea  that s right and oh was it so right     Great gastropub in the heart of the strip   Love the Aria hotel and this is just a welcome addition to it   The beer selection is off the hook and the food     the food was equally as amazing   Had a half dozen of the east coast oysters and the bleu cheese burger   Again  it was all amazing   Would definitely come back again next time we re in the city to try more of their fine pub fare   They have beer pong and other fun games should you choose to spend the day there watching games and chilling out ,4,2010-12-10
Had just eaten at a couple high end restaurants  the Sage notably  and had the worst service ever and had to pay for it     Expecting the same pretentiousness all over  we were pleasantly surprised when we showed up without a reservation and the hostess was a doll and our waiter equally nice   Not to mention  our food came fast   I love nice people and I completely sucked in all the smiles and graciousness like I was starved for it    The food was hit and miss but I can recommend the happy hour sliders and the bloody mary s    The bloody mary s are a meal in itself    Meaty with the right amount of spice  tart and tang    The beef sliders don t look like much when they come out but the meat is juicy and seasoned well with a dollop of carmelized onions   more please    Completely pass on the chicken sliders and the pretzel    They were tasteless and the pretzel was dry      This place has a nice  warm  low key pub atmosphere you expect to get at a local joint    That s hard to accomplish in a place like Vegas     Todd English also has another restaurant named  Olives  in the Bellagio and it has the same ambiance but is more upscale so I think it s a vibe he strives for      There is indoor seating and outdoor seating    The outdoor seating is right at the entrance to Aria resort but you don t feel like you re hanging out in the middle of everything    It s nice lil spot for people watching and you ll see a lot     ,5,2013-08-02
Todd English has done it again      Great place  amazing menu and atmosphere  where else can you play beer pong with food like this    Highlights of the menu include  reuben sliders  tuna burger  it is more like tartare put together than ground tuna meat  and the bison burger   Definately one of  if not the  best places in vegas to put down a few drinks  watch a game and eat some great comforting pub grub   Proves once again that you can never go wrong with a Todd Enligh restaurant ,5,2012-02-25
Todd  Todd  Todd I was expecting so much more from you  I was so dissapointed in this place not to mention that we spend over     and i left it to rot on the plate   Bloody Mary was excellent and i liked the additon of the chedder cheese squares  Oysters were on happy hour and very affordably priced  Lobster rolls were very good but by the third one the sauce was a little too rich for me so this is a must share item  NOW to the ALL time WORST burger I have ever had  Please refer to the picture i posted and you will be able to tell just from the texture and the look of the cheese that this thing was awful  This burger was supposed to be medium but it looked and tasted dry and charred      I think not   Me and the BF split the burger and by the time i got to mine he almost ate all of his so i couldnt really send it back ,2,2014-04-07
Seems like a cool place to chill and grab a few drinks at  Came here with some friends a few days ago while staying in Vegas and I was impressed by the look and feel of the place  They have an every day Happy Hour menu as well as beer pong and darts  They also have a   seconds or less challenge where you can participate in chugging a brew down in   seconds   I made it in       Didn t get to try the food but my fiance ordered the buttered lobster rolls w  aoli sauce and I took a bite    Not impressed  My friend who recommended the place said the burgers aren t too good so i just stuck to my free budlight you get when you check in and also tried a craft brew that was pretty good but I don t remember the name ,3,2013-04-25
Quick lunch   two apps and drinks   The onion rings were good  I especially liked the sauce though one person found it to be too spicy   I did not   The dirty chips were excellent  but the chicken livers were over cooked   Beer selection was good  but a gastropub should have unique vessels for drinks   Cider in a Guinness pint glass is just    wrong   Service was fast and attentive ,3,2011-12-08
A slightly upscale twist on a classic English pub  Located conveniently to Aria  it s a nice option for a meal just outside the casino  The menu is heavily pub faire with fish and chips and burgers that are quite good  and a craft beer menu to match  With a ton of tvs it s also a nice spot to watch a game  The fries are pretty fantastic too ,4,2018-07-13
Everything sounds good on paper  I ordered the pastrami Reuben  and it lacked flavor  like it hadn t been cured very long  the appetizers are great  we had the corn dogs and pretzels and both were great  the service was a bit lacking  especially for not being very busy ,3,2015-05-07
Amazing my husband and I frequent it every time in Vegas     The sandwich board is the best we get a lb  of whatever meat we want and share it  ,5,2011-09-09
After a rough night in vegas this place was the solution to all of my problems  Except for all of the money  That s gone forever  Regardless  after my friend was reprimanded for trying to jump through the window because he couldn t find the entrance  we were greeted by the best bartender i ve ever had  Aggie   She treated us as though we weren t still drunk from the night before  Best bar I ve been to in Vegas ,5,2017-05-27
Although my bf doesn t drink  he does on occasion  especially when he is at The Pub   My bf likes to stick to his Hefeweizen beers  while I like to go for the fruity ones   like peach and strawberry flavored beers  We actually like going here for the chill atmosphere of everyone having a good time   We ve tried the Dirty Chips  Duck Buns  and the Moules Frites as appetizers on   separate occasions  The Dirty Chips came in a huge portion  but I didn t like how they incorporated the fried chicken livers with it  Yuck  The duck buns are just like the ones in Chinese restaurants  nothing really special there  When we got the Moules Frites  we thought we got the wrong order  because we thought that it was suppose to be fries  It turned out to be mussels  which we should have read in the menu   but it was good  We devoured the sauce    mmmmm  We ve also tried the Bison Burger  which wasn t too bad and the Roast Beef Sliders  Sliders were not too bad    not too dry and a good size to go along with our huge appetizers    We will definitely be back again  but know not to order so much next time ,4,2011-01-18
round two and todd english s PUB is still churning out great food   Ordered the fish   chips  and the clams again    The clams are still phenomenal  Juicy  flavorful  tender  and HUGE  I wasn t even hungry but I kept dunking the bread back into the sweet ambrosia of a sauce    Fish   Chips looked scary at first because I ve had too many horrible ones that looked like the ones you get from PUB but boyyy was this delish   Tender flakey fish and a crunchy crust  The chips were SO SO  but the slaw that came on the side made up for that  Usually i don t like slaw but this one had peas  and green beans in it with a light and tangy flavor   Next round will be the raw bar ,5,2011-09-03
Good place to catch a game as they have TV s all over the place   Good draft beer selection as well as a full bar   On weekends  they have a bloody mary stand though I didn t try it   They have a   day a week happy hour with half off drafts and some food specials   Ended up coming twice during my last Vegas stay   Have had a buffalo burger  chili  and wings  all which I was satisfied with   The prices are more than they should be  but its Vegas so what can you do ,4,2013-12-16
I would go back  The food was good and we were there for happy hour so it was well priced  Also the   second beer challenge was fun to watch  We got fish tacos  and sliders and lots of beer ,4,2014-05-14
it s tough to find a quality place in a new casino in vegas and not overpay   after a bit of looking I believe this is the place  good happy hour  great food and selection make his place a home run   the Aria casino,4,2013-01-21
When you stay in Vegas you hope for at least great service  Well night one started off bad with a nasty waitress which was quickly switched out with a pleasant one  We came back   days later for late night happy hour and what a mistake   NO SERVICE in a place that s busy  They said sit anywhere we sit in the bar and then    min  later we were told we can t sit there cause section closed  We were moved to a table and    min  later we finally get approached to start our order  Don t come here if service is high on your list cause there in NONE    It seems like a great place to get some English chow and great beer but it rates low on the list for the way they treat the customer  I don t recommend and won t return ,2,2012-08-31
Judging by the other reviews  maybe we were here on a really great day  but my boyfriend and I truly had such a wonderful time that we came here twice in one weekend  We were home visiting my parents for Memorial Day but did   night at the Aria  After checking in we wanted a quick bite but didn t want to ruin our appetites for Hakkasan later so popped over here on a recommendation from the front desk agent  Obviously Todd English has a renowned reputation and resume to match  but judge this for what it is  a casual pub with a luxurious twist  He already has a   star elegant restaurant on the strip at Bellagio  Olives  so why compare    It s a fun atmosphere with outdoor seating in front of the pond outside Crystals shopping center and the Aria lobby  Inside is decked out with red leather booths  a large circular bar  and expansive tables  They have a sports theme and happy hour deals  so we ordered the wings which were a dollar a piece and were really really yummy  The perfect blend of crispy and tender  spicy and mild  dunked in blue cheese sauce  Then we split a lobster cobb salad which I believe is one of their signature items for good reason  We both had huge portions even though we split one order  and they were very generous with the lobster    The next morning all of the breakfast places at Aria were teeming with lines of tourists and we just weren t in the mood so we came back here  I had a dish that I may have possibly come up with in a dream   Bagel tacos  shell made from crispy thin bagel slices  filled with scrambled eggs  lox  sour cream  and caviar  served with a side of mixed greens tossed in a champagne vinaigrette  Whoaaaaaaaaa buddy this was amazing  T had a corned beef hash topped with poached eggs that was served in a personal sized cast iron skillet   There were women walking around who were literally busting  BUSTING  out of their red gingham bustiers hawking customized bloody marys which were pretty cool  We didn t order any but they had a paper checklist and you could add everything from herbs  peppers  onions  veggies  to oysters  lobster claws  bacon strips  etc  Would absolutely go back next time I m in town  Casual atmosphere with excellent food ,5,2013-06-11
It s nice to sit outside on a cool day  but was disappointed with a few things  Service was poorer than expected  My friend had ice tea and I had water and the whole time we didn t get our refills  I actually had to hunt them down to get me more water  Onion rings are killer great and the only reason I gave them   stars instead of    Had lobster Cobb and majority of the lobster meat was stringy innard like meat which I suspect might be from the tiny legs    There s claw but no tail meat whatsoever  It s really weird  When I buy lobster  I don t even bother outside of the tail and large claw    Seriously couldn t believe they served parts that I throw out ,3,2014-10-08
Overpriced crap   Experience  The staff was very friendly   I loved the ambiance and decor   However  I don t go to restaurants for the ambiance and decor   Food  They do a great job on the sides  but fail miserably on the main entree   I ordered the following      Bison burger  they put way too much blue cheese  it over powers the burger   I had to cut off the top of the patty  because it was making me nausea    Steak tacos  the steak was over cooked  which made it too chewy   The grilled corn and black bean mix was really good  but I don t like spending     for corn and beans    Side of mac and cheese  great  but it takes a lot to mess up mac cheese    Chicken parm sliders  decent  but nothing special  Overall  I tried this place   times  because I really wanted to like it   Unfortunately  I would have to say   strikes and they re out     For the price I expected more  not crap bar food I can get from Uno s Pizzeria ,1,2011-08-10
Monster portions that are fantastic is the short story    If you are going to have to single out a day to visit   make it the weekend and get the fully loaded bloody mary that can serve as your entire meal ,5,2014-11-19
Went here for a very quick happy hour special    hours before our flight      wings   pass on these  they re not very good        flight of beer and sliders  x  oz flight   excellent  Beers are high quality and the four in our flight were not even listed in our extensive menu  and   sliders   cheesesteak  asian slaw   salmon  turkey  all were excellent and very filling together    Service was just OK  we felt neglected and it took a long time for our food come out  However  it was very busy for a weekday afternoon  and the complimentary gorgonzola popcorn at the beginning kept us occupied while we waited for a server ,4,2012-11-18
Delightful  Delish   Located right off of the Aria   Me   my BFF  best sister in the world  were plowing around Vegas and spotted the Todd English Happy Hour special on a SUNDAY  whhhheeeeee    They feature a       promo for    sliders     oysters     chicken wings  We took advantage and OMG  The wings   sliders were fantastic  we didn t try the oysters   We sat at the bar and had top notch service  watched the Olympics at our request  and chatted up all kinds of friendly patrons and staff  What a wonderful place   I think we could have turned it into our very own version of Cheers  Extra thanks to the manager  Matt  He was personable and seems to really love his job and taking care of his customers and staff     Ryan   Lindsey at the bar are fantastic  Best service we have received in Vegas to date ,4,2014-02-17
Cool place to stop in for a drink  A variety of good drink options  There is a beer chug challenge  if completed  your drink is free  They allow     victories   beers per person per day  Too early for me to attempt but I enjoyed their Bloody Mary s  Bartenders were all very nice  Food looked tempting  hopefully next time in  I will be able to try ,4,2017-03-20
Went to dinner here with a party of    and the service was great   The beer is a little pricey though so prepare to spend a little there   I had the Chicken Pot Pie and it was amazing  served in cast iron pot and piping hot with tasty crust on top   Also had a side of macaroni and cheese and was also very very good and creamy   Will definitely go back to this place again  ,5,2011-06-07
Average  I ve had the burger as well as the seafood stew  Both were good  but nothing out of the ordinary  What irked me about the restaurant is the service  I was contemplating giving a   star simply due to the ridiculously terrible service  The waiter today was nonchalant and simply going through the motions of appearing to be helpful  The manager was the worst  Our table of six and the table behind us were watching the bear s game  With only   minutes left in the game  it got switched to some other game that was just starting  It took them about    minutes to switch it back and the manager insisted that all ten of us have been watching the other game this entire time and that the game has not been switched  Seriously   You re going to question the judgment of    of your paying guests and refuse to change the channel when you are supposed to be a sports bar  Ridiculous ,3,2012-12-31
If this was a inexpensive egg joint I wouldn t even bother with a review  but    We went for a late breakfast early lunch  Bacon and eggs was      and toast was extra  Poached eggs came out like hard boiled eggs  Poke appetizer was mostly cucumber  Food was WAY overpriced and not very well prepared  The Cobb salad was good  Service was just okay   nothing special  just doing his job ,1,2017-07-23
Todd English PUB is a nice place to have a beer  watch some sports  and eat some snacks while resting your feet after wandering around Vegas for a few hours   Prices are a bit steep  though this is a celebrity restaurant with  fancy  pub food   The honey and I ordered some  specialty  ales  and there is a decent selection of beers available   Spoiled by the Bay Area craft beer culture though  I didn t think that Todd English PUB really deserves to bill itself as a specialty beer kingdom    The honey and I ordered the dirty chips  which seemed like such a great idea when we ordered them and first started eating them  but quickly turned to regret   Everyone s descriptions of the dish are spot on  great when the cheese hasn t congealed  with the added bonus of chicken livers    but not so great when everything turns cold and soggy   The service was friendly and accommodating   The hostess cleaned up and prepped a booth for us after we specifically requested one  and our server was cheerful  upbeat  and didn t chase us away after we lingered a bit too long   All in all though  this seems like the  upscale  smoke free  place to grab a beer and a basket of fish and chips and relax   I would try this place again  but without the dirty chips ,3,2011-12-10
Although I didn t love the happy hour sliders  I really enjoyed the lobster rolls  And the beer list is phenomenal ,4,2011-12-19
Stopped by this week for happy hr specials     sliders means a slider not two not three just one mini burger   And I mean mini   Oysters were good   service great     A bit high on the        Oh well it s Vegas   ,3,2012-05-12
Being in Vegas their are a lot of celebrity chef restaurants  We found our way to Todd English s Pub  We got their      pm and it was a little confusing how to get into the restaurant   The entrance was not marked very well  we sat down and glanced at the menu  The first thing that caught my eye was the duck buns  and they were fantastic     They were prepared in the style of Chinese pork buns  They were stuffed with shredded duck in hoisin sauce and finished with a wonderful cucumber zitzi sauce type of concauction  I settled in ordering the prime rib French dip version meal and my wife had the chicken pot pie  They were great  I finished my sandwich in two seconds while my wife took her time in eating her pot pie because it was huge  Overall I was happy but they just because we were in Vegas everything has to cost an arm and a leg  The bill came out to     for just the two of us  ouch    That was with no drinks ,3,2015-06-26
The atmosphere was second to none  The food was great  The only draw back was a bartender named Mark  This PUB is a great opportunity for singles  as long as Mark isn t there to throw down the CB  Other than that  I would go back anytime ,4,2011-03-04
Service was horrible  Ordered a drink for one person  didn t even ask if anybody else wanted to drink and he left  Drink took forever to arrive  We got tired of waiting it just paid for the drink and left and did not get any food  Will not be back I,1,2017-02-25
My girlfriends invited me out for a night on the town    I am always a little hesitant to go out on the strip on a work week    however they mentioned something about Nickel Beers    I was shocked  there is a place in VEGAS that doesn t charge you        a drink    I was totally in    When we got there it was really busy and we had to wait in line  Once we got in the place was so crowded  When we finally got served at the bar after several minutes  we ordered as many PBR Nickel Beers as we could  I mean who could go wrong with a beer that only costs   cents    I m not a fan of PBR  but for   cents a beer    why not     They have an outdoor patio where everyone smokes at  and on the inside the bathrooms for men and women are combined  well just the sinks are in the same room  and they have a host in the bathroom who is really funny    I had a really great time  and definitely plan to go back in the future    Tuesday night from   until midnight is when they serve nickel beers  I would advise you to get there early if you want to sit at the bar ,4,2011-06-20
The bar staff is anxious to please  well trained  professional and a total dellight  The bartender  Eleanor is outstanding  The limited happy hour makes some of the pricing tollerable   I can only assume that     beer is in line with what the traffic will bare and what the excessive high rent requires  Definately worth a visit  expecially if you re on vacation   It would have one more star if the prices were more reasonable ,3,2012-09-10
Stopped in to check this place out for a quick bite and a couple drinks and we were pleasantly surprised  The staff was very friendly and attentive  Great beer selection  the food was great as well  I tried to go light with the sliders  the portion size was ample for the price and I left full and happy  I will be returning  that s for sure ,5,2017-01-14
This restaurant is amazing  The service was friendly and attentive  the Bloody Mary s were over the top with lobster  bacon  shrimp and anything else you can imagine  Everything we saw coming out of the kitchen made us want to come back and try later  The drinks were hand crafted with fresh ingredients plus they have a value packed happy hour  Oh and the breakfast sandwiches looked spectacular on house made brioche buns  Yum ,5,2015-01-03
I came here for the crazy Bloody Mary I had seen on Instagram and I was not disappointed  Would definitely recommend ,5,2017-07-18
Moscow mule      COCO mojo       Probably my least favorite Moscow Mule to date  It was mostly ice  the drink was gone I a matter of sips  and it was lacking in flavor  possibly because it was mostly ice  I know this is Vegas  but this was a bit ridiculous  The Coco mojo was probably not worth     but ok  Coconut rum drink  not that special    Those things being said we ventured back I later  we were staying at the Aria  which I HIGHLY recommend  and this place is nestled just out the side door  this time we tried several apps  and some new drinks  I m not usually into  adult shakes  it mudslide type drinks because I think the alcohol is usually lost in the sweetness  That being said  their Irish shake is THE BEST  I could really taste the Jameson and it was delicious down to the last drop  I recommend all their apps  the only down side here was they were much more filling than we expected  we had dinner reservations later in the evening and this definitely hindered our appetite later  Oops  So for next time  I know what I m having  and what I m not ,4,2015-04-15
The best service experience at a PuB  The hostess was nice  the busboys busgirls  were great but out server Lindsey was fucking awesome  Everyone  Was sweet  friendly and hospitable  The food was ok  But the service definitely reigned ,5,2014-08-24
Impressed for sure   The Dirty Chips were freak n bomb  I couldn t stop snacking down on them  Reading my friend s review  i decided to get the     pastrami  w  bread  and black truffle mayo and the horseradish  And it was pretty damn good  The black truffle mayo was a great dipping sauce  Sadly the sauce didn t last long since i was dipping everything in there   Next time I ll request   black truffle mayo  And the pastrami was also really good  Tender  The     order was still to much for me  haha   Beer  I don t remember what beer we got  but they have a good selection  I just remember the pitcher of delerium tremens cost      haha  Service  Good  Not bad  I ll be back for sure  I want some more dirty chips    haha,4,2011-08-24
A good choice for happy hour on the Strip  half off drafts     wings     oysters     sliders from    pm and    midnight    The whole menu looked pretty good  but since we had late dinner plans I limited myself to only things on the happy hour menu  The sliders and oysters were the most impressive  the oysters were fresh and served with several sauces and the sliders tasted much better than your average run of the mill hamburger  The wings were pretty disappointing  very little meat and a buffalo sauce that could have easily come out of a jar  Especially at    each  you can definitely do much better for wings elsewhere so it s probably a good idea to avoid those altogether   The beer selection is HUGE but slightly pricey without the happy hour discount           Make sure to pick something that you haven t tried before  Ask your waiter for help if you need it   If you re into chugging  make sure to go to the bar for the   second challenge  If you can chug a beer in under   seconds  they ll ring a bell for all to hear and your beer is on the house ,4,2013-02-22
Your first impressions when you walk into Todd English s P U B  in the new City Center are that your walking into a high class brothel   There are three hostesses  all gorgeous and perfect   s   One is white   One is black   One is Asian   They re wearing tight tops and very thin mini skirts    Hoochie mama    Why   I don t know   My only guess is that it s Vegas baby   Don t let this deter you from going a few more paces inside   I know this is not your usual pub scene   Hell  maybe it is   It s definitely not my usual pub scene  but to tell you the truth  I kind of liked it   In fact  after the entire meal was done and I walked out of the place  I wish every pub was like this one   It s another Vegas celebrity chef monstrosity but without the stuffiness   Use your cloth napkin and put it back on the table   Who cares   No one s going to frown upon you for bad etiquette   It s a pub for crying out loud     Beyond the three gatekeepers there is a gumball machine filled with ping pong balls used for beer pong   Personally  I d love to see beer pong played in a place like this   I know it s casual  but I don t think it s that casual   The beer selection is wonderful and delicious   I tasted one of their cask selections and an Anchor Steam   Then I had their chili and fish and chips   For dessert  a strawberry shake     Is there something that I could say that was wrong with the food   No   Maybe ask for some more bread with the cauldron of chili     The waiter was definitely not lingering over us to leave within    minutes   I feel the staff is trained for patrons to graze and relish over pub food done well   It is on the pricier side for this kind of fair  but you have to think to yourself   It is Vegas and there is no pub anywhere else that features three perfect    women when you walk in    The only bitch I have with the P U B are the restrooms   The good news  there are toilets actually inside the restaurant so you don t have to go outside and meander through a smoke filled casino   The bad news  there s a guy waiting for you to exit the stall to put soap in your hand and give you a paper towel   What a crock of shit   I know how to get soap and paper towels for myself buddy   Don t patronize me with that bullshit   It was one o  clock when I ate here   There does not need to be a bathroom attendant waiting for me to be done with my business in the very early afternoon   The excitement really went limp after I experienced that one   Overall  the food cheers you up in a heartbeat and so do the Charlie s Angels in the front ,4,2010-08-25
We were staying at Aria and we stopped in on a Saturday night and had some delicious eats  My husband got the most AMAZING Chicken Pot Pie I have ever had  I couldn t keep my hands off of it and I was so sad I didn t order it for myself  He was so annoyed with me moaning and groaning at how fabulous it was  I was tempted all weekend to go back and just order one to go  so I could enjoy it in the privacy of my own room  It was THAT good  I got the fish and chips  they were fantastic  but totally were a second thought after I had a taste of the pot pie  Our friends got the mini sliders  BLT  and corn dog nuggets that were all wonderful as well    If you re into Bud Light and Coors Light or simple beers like that  you won t be that happy with the beer selection  There are tons of beer  but the most simple beer for you would be a Corona  I love to have different beers  so it was nice to have one there   The ambiance is good  it was a fun place and I would go back in a heartbeat  Perhaps good ole Todd  would want to send me a pot pie in the mail      ,4,2011-08-26
It s been a few weeks since my vacation and I realize I still haven t posted a review  I keep going back to thinking of places I ve eaten at while at Vegas and Pub keeps coming back to mind  Both for service and for the quality of food served  There are other pubs by other famous chef in LV but the staff have a bad attitude and the food was average at best  I m talking about a British pub by a famous chef who I won t name  This pub is so awesome  The staff at Todd English s pub are totally helpful and nice while on top of their game serving us  Refills faster  food served up hot and giving sound advice for both food and beverage knowing the menu very very well  What pairs well along with details of each dish  having actually tried the most of the dishes and being honest if they have not  We went for a late dinner and were so impressed that we went back for brunch the next morning with the family ,5,2016-04-13
Checked out this place on a recommendation from a family member who eats at this place whenever they come to Las Vegas    The food wasn t bad  but definitely was over priced  The staff is pretty friendly  and the environment wasn t too shabby either  Unless you feel like spending         for appetizers  I would pass   ,3,2014-03-17
We only had to wait about   minutes to be seated  but that was about the only good thing about this place   The staff was not very friendly and it was difficult to recognize them with their plain cornflower blue t shirts   We asked for separate checks as soon as our server arrived   He replied   We ll deal with that at the end    Okay       so  we ordered  and the menu was VERY expensive       for a    oz  domestic draft deer   I thought that was ridiculous   The entrees were also p ricey  I paid     for a grilled cheese and fries   The food was OK  but not worth the money   Then  to top it off  when we asked for the check  he gave us   check with     gratuity added   We reminded him about separating it   He then went back to his register and took about    minutes to slpit everything up and process our payments   YES  I understand that splitting checks is a pain  but honestly  it s more and more common these days  especially in a tourist area like Vegas   The servers and establishments need to adjust to their market   I am a local  and will NOT be going there again   I thought for a     bill total  the servers should at least be wearing a collared shirt    ,2,2011-03-25
Ever since I tried their dirty chips  I ve been dying to come back and have them again   It s been a couple years  so sadly we found out they no longer are on the menu   Tried the Junk Chips instead  along with their prime rib sandwich   The Junk Chips just don t measure up to what they had with the Dirty Chips   Too wet and similar to nachos     please bring back the Dirty Chips    Sandwich was delicious ,3,2014-09-26
I had fun here  they don t take my drinks or food too seriously in Vegas  but these guys do  They have a lot beers on tap  and they can give you a lot of details till you find the right one for you  Seating at the bar is an added advantage since you can actually learn something new about beer  there  I said it  welcome to Vegas    Ask them about the   second challenge and see if you can drink for free fro the rest of the night  Enjoy some peanuts till you get the food  and make a mess  it s OK  Then go to the restroom and meet some girls or guys whatever  there  I said it again  welcome to Vegas    Burger and short ribs chili were good  but you are here for good times above all  Stop by id you are in the Aria Cosmopolitan Crystal shops area ,4,2016-04-07
We had been dying to try out Todd English PUB  When we arrived we had no reservations and it was a Saturday evening  We were seated right away  The hostess told us what her favorite thing on the menu was which is the brown butter lobster rolls  She explained them to us and it sounded so good that I thought I totally wanted to try that  So I ordered the lobster rolls and my husband had the fish and chips  Our waiter answered all of our questions we had about the different types of beers  He was very knowledgeable  The beer is so tasty  SO many to choose from   When my food arrived the presentation was lovely and I couldn t wait to dive in and eat it  IT was the best lobster roll I ve ever had   I am still dreaming of that delicious lobster roll till this day  Hopefully I can find a place in So Cal that has a lobster roll as good as this one  because if not I will be driving down to get one before the end of this year      We loved Todd English PUB   A must try if your visiting Las Vegas and love beer and good fish ,5,2012-03-05
Todd English P U B was passable for taking out of town visitors staying at Aria  Even though they had hand crafted and self created Bloody Marys  I still think my top   are     LBS    Peppermill    Hash House a Go Go  Bloody Mary s tried       self created and the Todd English Meat   Potatoes  which takes a great picture   Fat Girl Seating  Not bad but the tables are close together  but to their credit they do have armless chairs   it is sturdy  Food  boring  It was just ok  Broad selection but their brunch menu only had   items  My mini corn dogs were still cold in the middle  I m guessing from being frozen and then warmed up    the tacos  I shared the plate  were tasty but way too wet    types of sauce    the hash looked good  but was with lox so you know I didn t partake  We  deconstructed the grilled cheese sandwich  The Parm sliders were ok but the sauce was bland    My overall commentary  Thank the goddess it is not on my visa card  On the plus side  they have to go cups ,3,2013-04-22
Casual atmosphere  less than insane prices  a formidable collection of beer  beer pong and darts  and finally nickel PBR Tuesdays    I think all of this easily adds up to a place worth checking out especially if you happen to find yourself at Crystals  City Center or within walking distance  If you are a beer lover  then it is worth a cab ride for sure   I have eaten here on   occasions  and each time has been a pleasant experience  This last time service may have been a little slow  but I rarely get too worked up about service  as I was a crappy waitress in a past life    I have sampled several of their appetizers  but honestly  I think the real value and real tastiness lies smack dab in the middle of the menu  This is where they showcase their carvery  You pick some meats  some bread and some sauces  and then you go to town making sandwiches  They roast all of their meats  and it shows  The turkey is so tender that it would fall apart if you stared at it hard enough  The pineapple chutney could be eaten straight like a little sweet salad  but I usually go ahead and throw it on my sandwich  I get the challah bread  another winner  My husband went with the salmon last night  Yes  they have salmon  I am pretty sure I heard him mumble  delicious  in between stuffing his mouth  With the     lb option you get enough meat and bread to make a very nice   inch sub equivalent  My turkey was      Once when staying at Aria my husband grabbed a     lb turkey to go  and it was enough for a light lunch for the two of us   If you are looking for fine dining  probably not the place  but if you want a more casual place to throw back some beers and sandwiches  this is the magic spot ,4,2010-11-29
Great beers and food  Happy hour prices are comfortable  We visit each time we come to Las Vegas and note the consistency is remarkable,5,2016-11-26
This place scored damn near a   with me but   s are very rare in my opinion so I give this place a    Luckily I don t judge a book by it s cover because when we entered the hostesses seemed to have better things to do than there job and didn t even great us  they just looked at us  really    We may have been a little overdressed because it was Sunday football and I was wearing a suit and my wife a dress but what the hell  Anyway enough of that the rest of our experience was great  The beer selection is one of the best of seen  not because the amount of beer that they have which is impressive  but the quality of beer  All I have to say is Black Butte   this was already one of my favorite beers and the one that started me onto the path of beer greatness    years ago but to have it straight from the cask is a glorious experience  The food was high quality pub food with a twist  I had the prime beef and I have to say that this is a must if you eat meat  I am usually not very impressed with prime rib or anything like that but the flavor of this meat was better than any i d had before  Be aware that while this place is called a PUB  the prices are closer to that of a nice restaurant but IMO well worth it  If and when I go back to vegas this will definitely be on my list of musts ,4,2011-12-29
If you re here just for dinner and a beer or maybe brunch  then there s a good chance you ll enjoy yourself  If you ve come to drink more than two beers  you might be safe if you bring an extra Benjamin  Although they have a top tier beer selection  they ve quite simply priced me out  It s understandable for the price point for a cask ale or for a bottled specialty brew  but for common microbrews on tap  Boston Beer  Sierra Nevada  New Belgium  Anchor  that you can find readily and locally  the mark up is preposterous      for a pint of Fat Tire or Sam   Yes  I am completely aware and cognizant it s on the Strip  in Crystals  and it should be expected  but as Chris Carter would say   C Mon Man    My brother and I came here after a race during late night happy hour  Happy hour is the best time to have multiple beers because drafts are half off the average         price tag for a pint  Happy hour specials also include a dozen oysters for         wings  which include the wing  drum  and tip   and    sliders  These food prices are a minute discount from the regular price and you re not really getting that good of a deal   We enjoyed the food that we did taste  The East coast oysters were served with a mignonette  straight horseradish  and cocktail sauce  The wings had a more tangy kick and the sliders were a decent size with sweet grilled onions and a sauce on the patty  Dennis was our server and he did an excellent job and had good knowledge of the beer list as he offered me a Stone Brewing milk stout after I found out that they were tapped out of the Dragon s Milk  After we finished eating the apps and drinking a couple of beers each  our tab was sitting at      We didn t feel like going broke without even catching a buzz  so we passed on entrees and called it a night   I don t doubt that the James Beard award winning chef s food is delicious and I would come back to sample more but I would go with the game plan to not drink more than one beer  If I m on the Strip and looking for an even larger beer selection with pints that are literally half the price  I ll head over to Yard House in the LINQ ,3,2015-12-23
The PUB is one of these places that s really fancy  yet decorated up to be pretend divey  They pull it off nicely  and you actually feel pretty cool for hanging out in this place  I went on a Monday evening and it was pretty crowded  so I m sure it s jammed on weekends   The beer is the main attraction here   excellent selection all day  every day  but you really want to be here late night Tuesdays for   cent PBRs or any day for happy hour        when all drafts  wines  and well drinks are     off  Yes  that s right      off  That s a good happy hour at any place  but especially at one located within Crystals  or  as I like to call it  the Rodeo Drive of Las Vegas   Aside from that  they go for upscale pub fare   fish   chips  sandwiches  pot pies  etc  Their specialty is the  carvery   where you order a meat      or full pound   a bread  and some sauces to make your own rustic style sandwich  Among my group we had the grilled bologna sandwich  the fish   chips  and the corned beef  All were excellent  although highly priced      for fish   chips    Service was good  and they found us a table in the corner so we could have a little bit more room for the Baby   Overall  this is definitely a place to bring visitors  but I wouldn t come back on my own unless it were happy hour ,4,2012-01-11
We came partly to catch a basketball game but mostly for the beer challenge  A pint of beer  under      in   seconds  I could never do it  but a couple friends did  Apparently you can only try it twice a day  In terms of food  I had the lobster roll with coleslaw and loved it  Even though it s lobster and Vegas  I still think it s a little pricey at      It s also not a dish that will fill you up  I sampled a bite of the Perfect Cure  waffle fries  beef patty  chili  eggs  and the Pub Hash  corned beef  and both were so so  They are heavy dishes so beer pairs perfectly  I might come back with friends to watch a game and grab a beer  but I wouldn t call the food here a highlight ,3,2013-04-29
This is a great place to order a burger and beer   My girlfriend and I ordered a pitcher of sangria which is amazing  a couple of burgers and sliders and enjoyed our time people watching while sitting outside   We had a great experience and our waitress Samantha was outstanding  If you don t know what to order leave it to her and she ll make great suggestions because that what we did  I definitely will be back soon ,4,2013-05-15
We came here for a quick dinner after watching O and before heading out to clubbing  We first wanted to come here cuz we liked to sit outdoor  but we got there right when they stopped seating outdoor   The PUB was not very crowded  We quickly ordered our food so we could eat fast  We also checked in on Yelp and got free beers  I don t know why it took the server forever to bring out the beers while it was not many tables and many other servers were just chilling on the side   We order   sliders which we hoped to come out with fries  but they didn t  The sliders were pretty good with flavorful meat  tomato  shredded lettuce  caramelized onion  thousand island sauce  We also had Bangers and Mash which had   grilled sausages and creamy mashed potato  The sausages were actually pretty good although they didn t look appealing  I don t like creamy mashed potato   so i didn t like it ,3,2013-11-17
Came here because my kid wanted fish and chips   We thought how can a so called English pub screw up fish and chips but this was one of our surprise sin Vegas   My   year old who usually inhales fish and chips kept procrastinating which is when I decided to try a bit of the fish   The batter had a really funky almost bitter after taste  The chips still had the potato skin on which is not a crime but for the prices you are paying I expect proper British chips   the sort you get at the chippy down the high street      To their credit  the shepherds pie was excellent   Really good portion with nice flavorful mince at the bottom    That was their only saving grace      The other thing we ordered was a chicken pot pie   The only good thing was the peas and carrots on top  The chicken was kind of tasteless and the pastry   if you can call it that  was a breadth doughy mess   I expect a good puff pastry or even a decent shortcrust pastry in a chicken pot pie    Service was kind of slow even for Sunday night  Oh Yea   and the happy hour was a joke      per chicken wing ,2,2016-06-13
The beer options are massive  those that have sampled Olive s will be intrigued  but after   visits  there s a huge problem   the service is terrible  One thing that s happened every time I ve walked in from Pocket Park  is this dialogue with the hostess were I basically have to spell out that I m a diner  I would like a table for my party  and we want to EAT HERE  I don t usually walk into a restaurant to sight see  Please please  say hello  ask what I m here for  a reservation accepted or to be made  or an inquiry about getting seated   DO say hello to patrons  DO NOT text  talk with waiters  then go back to your paperwork duties  It s a constant complaint that has been discused on many blogs  podcasts  and with my friends    tries  something s wrong there   It s weird   I know  Anyway  expect even lesser service at the tables  you ll see some tables get pop corn  huge bread baskets  yours might even be one  but others will get just a quick pass from a waiter saying hello and then asking for an order  Then   prepare to wait  On all three ocassions I ve waited at least    minutes for the entree  That s rediculous for a PUB    The food is okay  the mac and cheese is fine  the bangers and mash consists of bland potatoes and bland sausage  even by english pub standards  The fish and chips is outstanding  The beer selection amazing   Just know what you re getting into here  this restaurant  after being open over three months does not have it s act together  And  the staff clearly acts like they don t care    If you love Todd English  I do  try this place  but otherwise skip it   it s not in the same class as his other establishments  I m pretty dissapointed ,1,2010-05-01
    for a draft beer   Crazy  We were so excited to be back after not having been in a couple years  Food wasn t good and one tiny beer was way over priced  Service was so so ,2,2017-03-06
Man I had high hopes for this place     Fundamental service issues plagued our visit    I made reservations and yet had to wait     minutes before we could be seated  We were seated at the tables near the bar and I asked if we could be relocated to a booth however the hostess said that they were reserved    Funny  I could have sworn that I too made reservations   This is my pet peeve of restaurants  Why make reservations if you are made to wait and still get meh seats    The restaurant seemed to be terribly understaffed as our server was handling     tables  It s not that I want to be waited on hand and foot but the average laps in time between service checks was no less than    min    Once we did manage to order our food  it did not take to long for it to come out  ALL of our food  appetizers   entrees  came out at once  Why is this a problem you ask  When you are serving items like their Junk Fries that have an extremely limited window of edibleness before it all turn into mush  So we found ourselves rushing to stuff our face before the chips became soggy while at the same time trying to enjoy our sandwiches  They must have messed up when the entered out ordered because the couple next to us had a similar order and their food came out in the normal staggered affair     On to the sandwiches    I had high hopes for the lobster roll and man did it let me down  First the lobster meat was warm  Not too sure if that was by design or not since       of everyone else serve it chilled  Secondly the claw meat was overcooked and rubbery  You could tell the  sauce thrown on the sandwich was literally thrown on the meat since one the rolls was smothered in sauce and the others has much  much less  Lastly the roll was half assed  One side was nicely toasted and the other  cleverly put on the inside  was not  consult my pics if you don t believe me   Off night or careless preparation      The     grilled cheese  Gricheactom  It should be relabeled as a panini and NOT a grilled cheese  It was grilled on a press and lacked any of the toasty buttery goodness you would expect from a grilled cheese   This is another dish that has a limited window of enjoy ability  Giant pats of brie inconsistently loaded in the sandwich and gigantic tomato slices quickly turned this sandwich into a mess  as well    Sorry Todd English  both of these creations missed the mark for me    Overall  there were too many basic restaurant     issues on our trip to overlook to validate anything higher than a    rating    Ending on a good note They have a great beer selection and if you check in via mobile yelp they offer a free Bud Light ,2,2013-08-11
Love the new feel and vibe here  The new chef  Chef Adam is incredible  He came to our table to introduce himself and the new rebranding of the establishment which was so cool  Food and service was great   I d definitely recommend this restaurant  ,5,2018-01-04
Ive been here many times over the last couple years and used to love this place  the happy hour was awesome with all beers on special   But as of last week they only have a couple beers that are on  happy hour  including PBR and Bud Light for     like that s a good deal   Atmosphere has changed since new ownership took over and it seems like this place doesn t have the same vibe anymore   ,1,2017-06-02
Pub not   Museum feel  open  patio dining  woodsy  with the feeling of it s the place to be   With over    draft beers  and a menu as wide as it is deep   awesomeness   A bit overpriced for the beers       and food is my guess for its overall low ratings   I got a free pint of bud light  Yelp check in offer   and a half pound of beef brisket carvery          Super tender  and super good   Came with choice of bread  and   sauces of choice  creamy horseradish and the mustard trio    Sports on the TVs  cool music  and a barrel of peanuts which I went ape for   The girls working here would be rated  normal   are wearing Daisy Duke type outfits   At the bar  professional yet fun bartenders steal the roost   Especially when double happy hours are promoted   p  p    p  a   All in all  a great outing  Thumbs up ,4,2014-01-02
Wonderful service   Hard to find in the mall   The craft beer selection is excellent  but a bit more than market value    The food   sliders   Shepherds Pie and  potato chips   were  well just pub food   Pretty much on a par with most decent bars or so called gastro pubs    I thought a designer chef would be better ,3,2014-04-28
Dined here last Sunday evening and happy to say we had a great experience     Fish and Chips yumm   Not the best I have ever had but delicious   The coleslaw with peas was great   Pastrami sliders delicious     Mini Corn Dogs   Good but would be improved with some type of fun dipping sauce   Shrimp Ordered by the piece   Very large and delicious   Drinks   Half yard of an interesting IPA Speak Easy Big Daddy IPA   Great   Atmosphere Decor Love all of the TVs and well lit room bar   Also love that the windows open up into the entry of Aria   Lively and fun atmosphere   The only downer was the service   A few different things      They brought the wrong entree for me  but to my delight  I had my correct order within two minutes       They brought our popcorn  complimentary  after our appetizers   Would have been nice to have as we were looking over the menu       Our server was pretty indifferent initially   After I started asking him questions about the restaurant  Aria  and surrounding properties  he opened up and was better   I am eager to return   This is a nice addition to the Strip ,4,2010-10-02
This is a place with the best service in Las Vegas  We actually felt welcomed here  They have a great beer selection and good bar food  We had their wings that were crispy and spicy  which we enjoyed but wished they were little bigger   They were mini wings  We will be back next time when we are in Vegas again ,4,2013-05-02
Todd English provided an enjoyable outdoor setting for a late afternoon lunch  The lamb pita sandwich with Greek salad was delicious and substantial  And saved me from a dinner of airplane food  However  I would have spiced up the raita  Surprised there were no Oregon beers  Prices much higher than expected  Definitely not your    lunch ,3,2016-10-22
First time here for dinner   When staying at the Aria or Vdara  this is a tradition usually for lunch   It was busy on a Friday night  but we only had to wait about   minutes   Checking in on Yelp we got a free beer   Corona Light  free is free you know   They have a great menu with a little bit of everything for everyone   We got the fried pickles as an appetizer   Thin  hot  delish served with   dipping sauces   Then came our hot dogs   All beef beauty about      with an amazing bun   It came topped with melted cheese and a sprinkle of scallions   It was served with skinny crispy fries in a funnel   I took     of the dog and a small handful of the fries back to the room  I highly recommend this Pub   Not quiet for a romantic evening  but you can do that later,5,2015-08-01
Terrible service   Put out on the small patio and left to the dogs   Put out in the patio and had terrible service   We sent a salad and a burger back and were still charged for them   Only three tables on the patio and we were forgotten   Inside was packed on a Friday night   They have a snobby beer list  no Bud Light or regular beers       a beer and you can get what you want ,2,2015-04-08
Came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon  got seated right away  Ordered the braised clams and corned beef   Food came about    min after I ordered   Never really been to this kind of styled pub before   The food would ve been good if I had a few beers on an empty stomach   I guess this isn t a place I would normally go to  A little to salty for my taste   The service was pretty good our server was attentive     I probably wouldn t come back   Just not my kinda place,3,2013-02-11
I loved the atmosphere of this place  everything had a theme and was so cute   The staff was very friendly and stuck around and chatted with us  however  the lobster rolls were horrendous   I m from the east coast and this is not what we call a lobster roll   I was expecting lobster salad made with the tail  some celery  vinegar  and mayo on a hot dog bun   INSTEAD  they have warm claw meat with aioli in a large roll   It was way too bready for my taste   I did get the chocolate cake  whoah   they should warn you it is the size of an infant s head    I think   people could enjoy a slice each and be satisfied   I would definitely come back  but I d order something else ,3,2011-04-07
Really great food  but steep beer prices at     for      oz craft beers  I ordered the lobster roll which was sooooo buttery and delicious   filled with giant chunks of lobster  a little mayo  and plenty of seasoning and butter    The restaurant was not very busy which is great if you want a quieter place for dinner off the beaten path in the Crystal Shops right at the entrance to Aria ,4,2017-03-06
From a   being horrible and a   being awesome   Food     Service     Atmosphere     Price      The food here was pretty bad and paying  x what it was worth made it taste a lot worse ,2,2014-02-18
Large place and  inviting pub feel  Beer selection is over the top   probably     on tap   I like Belgium beer and put together a flight of   that I hadn t had before  Impressive selection  Food was good quality but finished product was okay  Fish and chips was    and good   Not    good but it s Vegas  Would return and if I got food I  would try something,4,2016-09-24
At the last minute on a Friday night near City Center decided to try and get reservations at a restaurant   All the ones I wanted were booked  so I called Todd English PUB and they were able to give me a reservation   We got there  the place was packed but we were seated right away   Our server was very friendly and helpful   It took awhile to get our drinks from the bar  which kind of sucked  but the place was packed   The mussel appetizer we had was tasty and the  shrimp cocktail  was awesome   Just an FYI  the shrimp cocktail is not your typical item   The price is per shrimp and they are huge     Overall our entree s were good   Though nothing spectacular to right home about   Just good solid PUB food     It was  A  OK  for a last minute place to grab a bite before heading out ,3,2011-01-17
We just love this place   We first found the PUB two years ago and really enjoyed the food  the people  the atmosphere  etc       we were last in Vegas this past January and stopped in with a group of   of us   Everyone really enjoyed it as usual   So when we returned on June        we knew we had to plan on which day we would return   So we decided Sunday so we could enjoy the bloody Mary bar   My husband went for the ultimate and I just selected my own toppings from the menu   We might downsize our Bloody Mary toppings next time so we can enjoy more food from the actual menu   My husband had the Cioppino  which he as been craving since he last had it in January    It was everything he remembered   I had the lobster Cobb salad   It had a lot of lobster   I really liked it     So for our last day we were trying to decide what to do for lunch   Should we try Bobby Flay s burger palace       Nahhh  we can get burgers at home   We came back to the P U B     They didn t have Miller Lite which I normally drink so I saw a cider ale on the menu   I asked about that and then the server recommended a Pineapple Cider ale   It was soooo good   now I ll have to see if I can find it anywhere    We split   appetizers for our lunch    The shrimp cocktail whichh as a nice cocktail sauce  The crispy pickles with   dipping sauces and the Mussels     All three were very good and plenty for us to share as a lunch    My husband wasn t sure about the mussels   He s been converted   He loved them  We love the P U B  and will look forward to return on our next trip to Vegas  ,5,2014-06-18
Came here last year for a Bloody Mary and I remembered that it was one of the best that I ve ever had  so I decided to bring my husband back with me this time around to give it a try   We both ordered the bloody mary and an appetizer to share since we just came back from lunch     Bloody Mary   there tomato juice is so fresh and you can definitely taste all the spices that goes into the drink   It s topped off with a pickled carrot  green bean as well as an olive and piece of cheddar cheese   Definitely a must try here     Fried pickles   this was deep fried and came with   different sauces  It was like a blue cheese  thousand island and bbq kind of sauce   The pickles were sweet  not at all sour  so I really enjoyed it   My husband loved the Bloody Mary and was happy that we made the right choice in stopping by here   We were staying at Aria Hotel  so it was conveniently located right in between the lobby and mall   The staff was friendly and I absolutely enjoyed our bartender   We will have to come back and try the food next time ,4,2015-07-24
Happy Happy Happy Hour  From     M F half price pints and wine by the glass you cant go wrong  With a wide rang of beer on tap here are my favorites   Anchor Stream   A San Fran Beer with a toasted malt flavor and a hop finish  you will love it Guinness  You can never go wrong with this stout on tap Pyramid Audacious Apricot Ale  I m usually not one for fruity beers but this is an exception  Amazing Ale with a burst of Apricot and hints of lemon and wheat  Delirium Tremens  Belgium  This hoppy beer that sits at a      alcohol content is amazing  crisp yet yeasty you will love this beer  But be careful  its strong     Now for the food     You can never go wrong with starting out with the Beer Battered Onion Rings  they come with this spicy ranch dipping sauce that truly makes the dish  Ive always wanted to try the dirty chips too  kettle chips with bacon bits scallions and chicken livers    ill def try that next time  I had the West Coast Burger for my entree  Its a turkey burger  with sunflower sprouts  bacon  slaw  avocado and dressed with honey mustard  It also came with huge fries  So yum  My friend ordered the New England Fish   Chips  They were truly authentic and amazing  We also shared a side of Mac   Cheese    don t judge us it was worth the calories haha  The decor is beautiful as well  Surrounded by windows and natural light It was a nice escape from most pubs that are dark and dim  I also noticed they had beer pong pool and darts  How fun  The bartender told us about the drinking contest they had  Drink a pint in under   seconds and its free  Now i would never try this but I m sure it would be fun to watch    All in all this place is a fun change of pace from the typical Strip Restaurant  I suggest it highly ,4,2012-09-02
I loved it the first time  Liked it the second  It seemed more like a diner this time  Fast paced  Bright lights  No true ambience  The food was okay not really great  The restaurant needs a face lift  We had a high table  pub style the first time we came  It was near the bar and it was interesting  We sat in the cattle herded booths this time and it was really boring   Funny  the lobster roll was probably the same  but seemed just blah this time  The service was okay as well  Not much more to say about this visit  Probably won t return for a while ,3,2017-07-13
I went there with my husband   years ago and it was a   ish    We waited a  long time on a middle of the week  off season mid day very slow     My daughter and I went last night the dinners were cold and we were completely underwhelmed  I got the lobster rolls  I have to admit the bread part was magical nit the rest especially the bland  nasty oniony cole slaw yuck  My daughter had hangers and mash    no gravy and ice cold ,1,2016-02-03
Wanting some decent food around midnight without having to pay Mastro s prices  four of us wandered into Todd English P U B   We were seated quickly on the room on the side and given the Late Night Menu  good from      pm     am    Looking around  they seem to have the raw bar in the middle with the small  slightly darker and more pub like room on the side  an outdoor patio on the other side  and a more well lit dining room in the back   There s a mix of polished cement  tile  and wood throughout   It s modern yet still warm   The beer menu here is fantastic   It s not as extensive as some places  but they have a great variety of quality beers with excellent descriptions   I had the Wexford Irish Cream   For those who love cream ales and rue the day that Caffrey s was bought out by Coors who stopped importing it to the US  then Wexford is probably the closest thing you ll find   The food here is good too   Not the most amazing food in the world  but very tasty   We shared a bunch of plates     Caesar salad  Pretty standard   Very good croutons     Grilled soft mini pretzels   These are about the size of a long cigars     Corn dog puppies   I m not usually a fan of corn dogs  but these were fantastic   Amazing  light  yet tasty breading   They came with skinny fries which were unremarkable     Kelley s roast beef sliders   KM asked for them without wiz  which made them a bit dry   Passable  but average     Chicken parm sliders   Just how chicken parm should be but on a small bun   Good stuff     Man of steel burger   Cooked just right   The potato bread bun was a nice touch   The only downer here is the service was sort of off   For a place that was less than half full our waitress took way too long to make her rounds ,4,2010-12-14
I think we should have stopped with just having  bar  food and drinks   The hot wings were pretty good but then we got our entres   One of us had the chicken pot pie which was ok but very watery and someone needs to learn how to season and I got the fish and chips   They were so greasy you could literally ring them out  We wound up sending that back and not having them try to make another one  ther was no taste as well  someone really needs to season the food   I think it would be reAlly good bar food but way to over priced for the food in the restaurant   Not sure we will come back ,3,2013-07-22
Very disappointed  Service was spotty  The food was not good  We had sliders that were thin patties with too much bun and the meat was bland  We also had chicken tacos that were also bland  the Mac and cheese that was recommended was ok  But the really nasty part of the experience was when one of the waiters was eating blue cheese out of a ramekin while working  then used the same fingers he stuck the cheese in his mouth with to put olives in a martini  Todd English should be embarrassed to have his name on this place  I do not recommend and I will not go back ,2,2015-04-22
I used to come here all the time for their lobster rolls because they were the best  but ever since the MGM took over it s just not the same  barely any lobster and I swear they got way smaller     The Bloody Mary was ok     def a meal but the Mary itself wasn t that tasty     I used to love this place but now portions seem smaller and it s just not as good   Wahhhhhh,4,2017-04-22
I appreciate P U B  esp  since the strip has few bars with long beer lists   That said  the selection at Burger Bar is longer and better   Nonetheless  my husband and I enjoyed stopping here for to try some new beers  and the bartender was friendly ,3,2010-05-24
Good bloody Mary bar  not     good  but good  Great strawberry mojito  well worth whatever I paid for it  They drew me in with their fried bologna sandwich  Totally gross  I know  In my defense  I grew up with fried bologna sandwiches and have nostalgic memories attached  The bologna wasn t fried enough for my taste  The Texas toast was too buttery and way too much mayo ,2,2013-01-07
We walked in for a pint b c it was HH   which is a fantastic deal  Bar was packed with diners and March Madness fans  Overheard it was just as busy at St  Pats  We got some bar seats from a couple that was leaving  So that was a plus  Not sure how long the wait was for a table   Was in amazement at how hard everyone was working  Especially our bartender Ralph  Who you MUST seek out when your there  Honestly he earned this place its  th star  Great atmosphere  Food looked good  we had reservations elsewhere that night    Was coming out at a good pace  Cask conditioned beer HUGE plus  Good selection of other beers too  Everyone was having a good time  Especially entertaining to watch people attempt  the   second beer challenge    And all this coming from someone who is in the biz and hard to please ,5,2013-03-24
Vegas stop     after we drove in from LA was to grab dinner here  Oh man  absolutely delicious  Started off with a cup of Franziskaner  for someone that doesn t super enjoy beer  it s great   really light  not bitter at all  and I tried something from the raw bar for the first time  a littleneck clam  Served on a plate of ice with cocktail sauce and malt vinegar with a line  it was so freaking good   The menu had a carvery section that seemed to be their specialty and was the only thing that wasn t too cliche sounding  or crazy sounding   so I ordered the half pound of pastrami  The meat was so thick and delicious  By far  the best sauce was the black truffle mayo   The horseradish sauce was alright too   I want to say that the atmosphere kind of felt like the Yard House  Lights turned down really dim  TV screens all over the place  a bar in the center where people were milling around  slightly loud  but you could still talk to the people at your table without raising your voice ,4,2010-06-19
No longer Todd English   Most of their menu is gone    No raw bar   No pot pie   Prices are expensive        Ruben was OK   Service was great but I want more options   Food was slow to come out when empty   I was a fan   Good bye ,2,2018-01-14
As a local  I don t venture to the strip often  but Todd English PUB has become one of my favorite places to visit when I m there  I am a huge fan of craft beers  and the selection here is superb   What makes it even better is the knowledgable bar staff  I have been here three times and have been extremely impressed with the bartenders during all visits  I ve been helped by Charlie  Lawrence  and Kelly  These guys are all awesome   They re incredibly knowledgable  helpful  fun  and you can tell they care about you enjoying your experience    Again  the craft beer selection is impressive  but Charlie and Lawrence were insanely helpful in selecting delicious beers for my palette  If you like whiskey bourbon  Kelly stirs a deliciously mean old fashioned  I ve had the buffalo wings and the bangers and mash  Both were delicious and I d definitely order them again if there weren t so many other items on the menu that I can t wait to try    Todd English has a late night happy hour  and while you re there they have some great new live entertainment   The band is Good Day Olly and they re two guys who play a wide range of acoustic covers  And I really do mean a wide range  Wagon Wheel  Britney Spears  Queen  a super fun hip hop mashup  and so much more  They really interacted with the crowd and even had a request board where you could write down songs for them to play  thanks guys   Beer  whiskey  and live music  what more could a girl ask for ,5,2015-11-01
I have wanted to try this place since it opened  I m a fan of good burgers and great beer selections  and this place looked like it had both  Finally had the chance to get there  and man  was I disappointed    First of all  the beer list describes a    PBR  yes  no joke     for PBR   with the following    light to moderate body  nice even crispness  clean palate throughout with a great wrap up of dryness in the finish    How about    the stuff we drank in college because it was only       Now that s an accurate description  and I wouldn t have to pay    for it   To their credit  if you go after     beers are half price  so you ll end up paying what a beer actually should cost    We ordered some wings  because  after all  every good pub has good wings   Ten minutes later  a server walked past our table with a plate of wings  no reason for us to believe they were specifically ours  and he started arguing with other servers  After a couple of minutes  he threw the wings down on the table next to ours and said   congrats  you got free wings    Another server then asked us   did you guys order wings    Yes  we did   we replied   At this point  the guy picks up the wings from the table he had just given them to  for free   mutters something about us  and throws the plate down on our table   What did we do to make him so angry   All we did was order some wings      Burger was fine   wings and fries were all mediocre    Overall  service was horrible   Nearly the entire staff seemed disgruntled      We were waited on by four different people  none of whom seemed like they wanted to be there   It took twenty minutes and three requests just to get the bill   I d suggest going to Applebee s instead  the food would be about the same  the beer would be priced appropriately  and I think your servers would be a little happier   Or head down the strip to BLT Burger ,2,2012-04-20
Food was delicious   The fish and chips were super fluffy and full of flavor   The bloody Mary was amazing   The mix was definitely housemade   The beer list is spot on   Service was a bit slow  it wasn t extremely busy   Would return and recommend to friends ,4,2016-09-13
The food was pretty OK  it was kind of plain bland  I liked the fries  Cool vibe inside and the service was friendly  It s very dark inside  I received a free beer for checking in on yelp too ,3,2013-12-22
This was such a great find  My boyfriend and I stopped in today for happy hour  Still functioning on east coast time  the           PM time slot was really dinner for us  We were attracted to the large menu and half priced draft pints  Little did we know that they are also doing a  Twelve Beers of Christmas   with a new draft every day until Christmas for        So amazing  We scored Winter Lager  Sam Adams  for ridiculously cheap    you just don t find that on the strip   We ordered twelve oysters from the raw bar to start and they did not disappoint  Fresh horseradish  cocktail sauce  lemon wedges  and another sauce which was Asian inspired accompanied them  Super fresh  salty  and a decent size made this Carolina girl  read  oyster snob  a fan  I also ordered a wedge salad and was really impressed by it  Bacon vinaigrette  bacon pieces  fresh tomatoes and avocado  chopped egg  and blue cheese equals serious wedge perfection  I ate the entire thing  My boyfriend had the grilled bologna and thought the sandwich was great  The only downside was that it said it was served with kettle chips but they were no where to be found  Service was attentive at the bar but also a little sporadic  so he chose to just let that slip up go and not ask about them   Overall  the food was great and the fact we found       draft beers is a miracle  We ll be back  as in tomorrow  to see what is next on their  twelve beers  list   Happy to have found this place ,4,2014-12-15
Perty classy joint but yet casual  lots of beer on tap and the food was was really good,5,2012-02-28
A good pub  not great  We really liked the shepards pie but were disappointed with the organic chicken pot pie  The chicken seemed overcooked and the portion was a bit small  We liked the beer on tap  The vibe here is good and it does approximate an English pub  minus the curry  We would try it again ,4,2010-12-22
Stumbled upon this place for lunch  reasonably priced and food was great  The lobster rolls were so buttery and toasty   just delicious  Todd s tacos were very good too  Good place to take a break and enjoy a good meal ,4,2015-05-20
Ah  Todd English P U B   how you have failed me   When this place first opened it was awesome   The decor is nice and they have little hourglasses attached to the bar  which is part of their free beer promotion   If you can drink a pint of beer in   seconds or less  it s free     Now  let me be clear   I do not have that skill with any sort of liquid   But some of my friends do so it was fun to go with them and watch   The promotion used to be unlimited   But  as these things go  the rumor from the staff is that someone ruined it by chugging    Guinesses in a short amount of time  bringing up questions of potential alcohol poisoning and lawsuits   So they limited to   beers   Fine   That s reasonable   But then they limited to   beers for no apparent reason  Now the promotion  which part of their logo and permanent decor  is limited to   beers     Their other promotion    cent PBR night  has also gotten lame   At first  when they started it in April  it was so laid back   We d sit at the bar and order the   cent PBRs  served in   oz plastic cups  during the requisite hours  Tues after  pm    Now  even if you spend      at the bar beforehand  they make you get up and go outside to get a wristband   I get that the promotion has become popular but  cmon   If we ve been sitting at the bar already  you hopefully know we are of age   Just give us the damn wristband instead of making us go out in the cold to get it   Oh  here s an interesting incident   During   cent PBR night  the staff made a group a girls get up and give up their seats at the bar to a guy who wanted to order food   The guy was extremely uncomfortable with this but the staff was insistent    they wanted the sale   The guy made up for it by being nice to the girls  buying them drinks  besides   cent PBR  etc   But WTF   Finally  the food has gone way downhill   The dirty chips used to be extremely craveable   Last time I got them  the portion size was smaller and they were nasty and soggy     The staff here has been really good to me   They d make recommendations and let me try drinks beforehand that they thought were questionable   I even got some free refills on cocktails and beer   It was a fun place to go and chat with the nice bartenders   I like the staff and really want to like this place  but I think management has cut corners for some reason and screwed it all up   Alas ,2,2010-11-23
This place was really nice  I got the duck legs and wife got the lobster rolls  Both very yummy  Plus got a free beer when I did this Yelp review  It s kinda hard to find and get to but worth the trip  Not your typical pub but the food options were great ,4,2014-10-27
Sat at the bar and had the worst service I ve ever had      This place is so overpriced its a joke   The only good thing is the cheap oysters ,1,2013-04-11
One of my new favorite spots on the strip  Lots of unique beers to choose from and great food   The chicken pot pie was very filling and rich   If you love rock music this is the place   Everything from Pantera to Journey   I will be back ,4,2016-01-17
Really overpriced pub food and drinks       for four people eating sandwiches and having a cocktail  Good sized portions  I had the chicken and bacon sandwich  It was decent and comes with a ton of fries  The salads are huge ,2,2015-04-15
Great food  fast service and free comedy relief  Thanks Richie Baldino  We had the Fried Bologna Sandwich  which was great if you like fried bologna  I do    We also had the Buffalo Burger on Richie s suggestion  also very good  but you d better be hungry  it s a ten ounce burger ,5,2012-10-08
Let me begin by saying I m not a big fan of bloody Mary s  so after a long night of drinking I guess this was the perfect remedy for a hangover  and boy these were damn good  You can customize it to your liking anyway you want it and they have tons of topping options it s crazy mad  I also had the oysters not bad for   bucks a piece I would so come back here next time I m in town,5,2014-11-12
Love this place  Bartenders are super nice  especially Agi  They have a great oyster bar and lively atmosphere  It is right between the Aria and Crystal shops  Great place to hang out  Haven t tried the food yet but it looks great ,5,2017-01-14
Service is crummy  And the food mediocre   The pub burgers so so with shredded iceberg it s more McDonald s than    upscale     and cheese will cost you   bucks more   Compound the lackluster service  mediocre food and     taps and it s a pass ,2,2015-12-21
This is the best bar ever  Our waitress  was wonderful and the food was great too  Definitely coming back when I come back to Vegas ,5,2017-01-14
Stopping at PUB for lunch while on vacation wasn t a planned move for us but will definitely be a scheduled stop next time my boyfriend and I are in town   We weren t famished when we showed up and really just wanted a little lunch to hold us over   I ordered the fish and chips and couldn t have asked for anything better   The fish was HUGE  really  and fried perfectly   It was served with a highly complimenting malt vinegar aioli and  English style chips    My boyfriend ordered the hot dog and he couldn t stop talking about it   I m not a big hot dog kinda gal but I did try it    twice  Our biggest problem at PUB was trying to decide what we wanted to order   They have such a great selection we really can t wait to go back ,5,2011-09-26
We stumbled upon this place walking around Crystals and honestly it was delicious  Our server recommended the lobster rolls and pastrami Reuben and they didn t disappoint  Very tasty  They offer a bucket of popcorn as a small snack before your food arrives  We had the fried pickles  but what was interesting was that these pickles were sweet instead of salty so it created a nice fusion of flavor with the dips  Overall  a fun and delicious atmosphere,4,2016-08-11
I m sure the food is great  and I would have loved to have experienced it  We tried to eat here late this evening  and were told by the host and hostess  who were very nice  by the way  that the outdoor patio area was closed  but we could order food and drink at the bar and take it out with us  That sounded great  since the entire reason we picked this place was because of great reviews online regarding the outdoor seating  We approached the bar and told the bartender what the hosts told us  He proceeded to act like a complete passive aggressive tool  didn t offer us menus until we asked and was just plain rude  We walked out because of this bartender s poor attitude  He missed out on what could have been a nice tip  We  however  didn t miss out on anything because we found another great place to eat outdoors on the strip    One that actually has nice  professional staff ,1,2016-04-14
We were headed to the Aria Cafe for brunch lunch  but the line was ridiculously long and we weren t feelin the wait  so  we headed back out of the Aria and into Crystals  the ginormous bloody marry peaked my partner s interest  so  in we went   It was closer to lunch  but I was in the mood for breakfast  so  I went with the challah French toast  It was delicious  My partner ordered the chicken fried steak and loved it  Prices were about what we expect for strip eating  We plan for it  so  it s all good  We left very satisfied  That was a plus   Service was spectacular  Ask for Melissa  she is absolutely phenomenal provides the best service in Vegas ,4,2016-07-05
If you want great food and a cool environment  Come here  Chuck took care of us and he was amazing  Ask for him and he will take care of you ,5,2015-10-18
I brought a couple clients to a lunch here today and had drinks and entrees  I noticed hallway through my lobster salad that there was soggy paper towel in the salad  How disgusting    This is supposed to be a high end place   So I didn t make a big deal because I know mistakes happen but I was grossed out and didn t finish the salad as my clients finished up eating  They even made a few comments about it and I said it s not a big deal  I mentioned to the bidder and the server that my salad had the paper and pointed it out  They both basically said is there something you would like me to do  If I knew my company made a mistake I would just correct it ink stead of asking the customer to ask me to correct it  Maybe comp the salad  So I let it go  then I decided a few hours later to call and complain  because the bill was      for three people for lunch with one drink     So I talked to the manager tonight who basically asked for the servers name  didn t really address the fact that my salad was complete trash      salad   And basically blew it off with the comment   I will make sure the chef knows to make sure there isn t paper in salads   Help me understand  why do you need to tell your chef to not put paper in the food  I would have expected the manager to say  I am so sorry  come in tomorrow and I will take care of you  Or maybe a gift card or an apology or maybe something     I got totally blown off  I have several trips to Vegas annually and go out to eat  x a day  needless to say  they won t be getting one of those meals in the future  Mon ami gabi on the other hand was delish today at breakfast  I think I ll go there for lunch tomorrow and dinner on Thursday ,1,2014-02-26
Came here for lunch with a few friends  The place was packed   The staff were friendly and place was clean and very nice decor  We sat at the bar  I ordered my drink and I wasn t to hungry but I tried the duck bun  It was supper good  It came with four bun   My only complain would be if they can use less sauce on the duck  Overall would definitely come back and drink some more ,4,2013-08-18
Went there twice during a recent business trip and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere  fantastic beer selection and good happy hour deals    As far as food is concerned  I didn t try much because the summer heat in Vegas suppressed my appetite  but what I did sample was tasty  Some of the best Buffalo wings I ve had  and only a buck per wing during happy hour  On my second visit I had the delicious chicken parmesan sliders   a few raw oysters  only    each all day long  flown in fresh from Vancouver   Beer selection was the best I ve seen in Vegas  although very overpriced with craft beers going for around     pint  Go during happy hour and they re much more reasonable at half price  I drank Dogfish Head    min IPA  my favorite beer  and the Speakeasy IPA which was solid  FYI  glasses of wine are also     off during happy hour   Great music selection  from Beastie Boys to Zeppelin   attentive bartenders  and quirky but classy decor    I D U G  The P U B ,4,2012-07-01
Awesome food and beer selections  Awesome prices as well  Tiffany our bartender was the best I have ever seen in my life ,5,2015-09-11
Great beer selection  The lobster rolls are amazing  Service is just ok  Hung out here with my husband and watched some sports on our mini get away  Had a good beer flight but kinda pricey  Then again it s Vegas and everything is expensive  Good knowledgeable bartender  girl with short blonde hair and tattoos    And then there was a crabby bartender who looked like a mean Russian dude  Good hang out to chill at the bar and watch sports  Nice outdoor area to people watch ,4,2012-05-01
We went in on a Thursday night  The service was AMAZING  Matt was the bartender and he was super helpful and cool  He recommended the lobster rolls and they were pretty good  They were a little heavy on the bread and claw meat but overall pretty good  We also had the corn dogs and wings  Both were very good  Beer selection is not great  but I m not a fan of any imported beer  I just have a taste for American beer I guess  but overall  a great place to spend a low key evening in Las Vegas ,4,2012-10-12
I loved Todd English PUB   It seems like some places that blend nice and casual fail terribly and some succeed wildly   I think Todd English PUB does the latter   From the beer flights to the tile walls to the tv s with sports to the chicken pot pie on the menu  there are real pieces of casual flare everywhere even though it is located where the Aria hotel meets the Crystals shopping area  two of the nicer complexes in Vegas    But don t let the casualness fool you  the food is not lacking   The shrimp cocktail is really good and especially the cocktail sauce is amazing   The beer flights are fun and depending on your taste can be really good     I had the ckicken pot pie for dinner and to be fair  I love chicken pot pie almost anywhere I can get it but to also be fair is was really freakin good   Overall  it is a fun place that IMO takes the best of a casual food atmosphere and blends it with really good food which I love   I especially love it because all to often I feel like I end up at places that use the casual element on the food prep and make their atmosphere nice but stuffy and thus fail on both sides   I also love that they serve PBR ,5,2010-05-28
Beautiful restaurant and the beer was ice cold and served with a smile  The bartender had a very nice personality and was very helpful when asked questions about the area  We will definitely go back for lunch dinner ,5,2017-05-15
Came in for Happy Hour because of     savings on fresh oysters  beer  draft   bottled  domestic   imported and snacks  PUB extends Happy Hour prices to table seating in addition to cozying up to the bar which always seems  packed in like sardines    Everyone is so friendly and service was fast  We felt like we were somewhere in England surrounded by white tiles like the underground trains  Yet  you knew this is just transplanted decor as hard rock bleared  adding to gastropub ambience   After slurping down oysters and beers  we ordered pub sandwiches  You have a choice of     pound or   pound portions      pound was plenty enough  The pastrami was not your typical deli style thin cut slices but was served as tender chunks with your choice of fresh baked bread and   sauces  Gosh  I couldn t resist truffle mayo to accompany my sandwich  Meanwhile  my husband chose the     pound crispy duck legs  you get   legs   thighs   He shredded pulled the duck meat off the bones and filled the bread  He also chose the truffle mayo  although the maple soy glaze would have worked well with the duck  Yummo   In the end  we stayed for   rounds of beer   were filled with our delicious selections  I m so full  I need to lie down   We d gladly return to PUB during our stay in LV but  we re running out of time and want to hit the casinos ,4,2013-10-28
This place was pretty decent and probably would have been better had we fit it into our eating schedule better   I do t remember this place as much as others well because I had more to drink that night    and I was really tired   I do recall the food being good  and a good place to watch the game   The only other memorable thing was the black beer  the free one   was knarely ,3,2015-01-25
Not many people know that this place is the home of the   second beer contest   Basically  if you finish a beer  of your choice  in   seconds or less  you get it for free   The glass starts on the table and must end on the table   Kind of nerve racking because they are banging on pots and pans while you are drinking  along with the pressure of the   second hour glass   If you ve never tried it before  I d recommend you get a Guinness because it has less carbonation  therefore easier to down   How did I do  Let s just say I ve accomplished one of my goals in life haha                           To update this review  they are no longer accepting guiness for the challenge   You must choose a   dollar beer that s off of their menu   I recommend the Irish cream   It s the easiest of the allowed choices                            Oh and as a sidenote  be careful when you do this because my friend was so anxious that when he knocked the glass up  he got whiplash from it LOL   He was hurtin  for   months hahahhaha   He s never gonna live that down for the rest of his life     But anywayz  on to the food  I had the bison burger  medium  and my girlfriend had the roast beef sandwich on an english muffin served with fries with your choice of two dipping sauces  she chose the truffle mayo and bbq sauce    The bison burger was very tasty but I should have ordered medium rare because it seemed a little overcooked   The roast beef sandwich                       That s cussing in a good way because it was       fantastic      Meat was tasty  a little salty  but the black truffle mayo neutralized some of that salt  and the pickled sides it came with were a nice touch   I would have given this place   stars except that this place is quite pricey   But what do you expect  It s basically center strip vegas in an upscale hotel   Beers are upward of   dollars     so make sure you DONT fail on your seven second beer binge hehe ,4,2010-08-04
Excellent pub  We started with the crispy mozzarella and fried pickles and both were great  We shared the Pub Burger and we re very pleased  Double patty with saut ed onions  pickles and  special sauce    very good  Our server was attentive and kept our glasses full  I would highly recommend ,5,2017-12-28
Delicious     The lobster roll sandwich was amazing   The potato chips was okay and the coleslaw  Oysters were sweet and perfect  they have the special hot sauce  naked cowboy  just for the oysters  French fries are also amazing   Definitely perfect combination with the amazing lobster roll  Also beware of the bangers and mash  it is hearty and will fill you  The sausage size was massive and the mash potato contained cube size potato and large bacon bits  Share this meal or come starving  Love this place ,4,2015-07-05
Hands down the best service  during rush hour weekend lunch  Our server  Trisha treated us like family and catered to our needs during such a busy weekend  We had party of   and all our drinks were topped off and she kept checking on us to make sure we were having a good time  I ve been to a lot of pubs and this one ranks among thebest ,5,2013-04-15
I m still dreaming about this place   The dirty chips  pretzel bites and french fries were ALL delicious    the best I v had in my life   the lobster roll   Amazingly devinely dream worthy   Service was     a tad bit pricey  but expected on the strip  esp in Aria ,5,2011-06-17
We should have heeded the warning by the lack of stars    There are so many great restaurants in Vegas that it was a shame that we wasted a meal here  It was that lackluster   I would have preferred to go back to The pub at Caesars Palace which is usually our regular  lunch the day before we leave  spot  But it didn t open until       and our flight was earlier  This place opens at          Another tip that this meal would be uninspiring   The server gave a squinty face when my husband asked about   dishes    Husband   How about the bbq meatloaf     Server   eh I ve heard mixed reviews  Husband   the pot pie   Server   eh it s ok  Pretty bland  Husband   is anything good here   Server   hmm   let me think   So I had the fish and chips and my husband had the buffalo burger  Mine was as expected   fried  Although it was especially greasy  It was also very under seasoned  The English pea coleslaw was pretty good    The burger was mhuh  Same thing  Greasy and under seasoned    Everything was way overpriced      I know  I know   It s Vegas   But it seemed even more overpriced than some      Bloody Mary s and mimosas were        You could get some fun add ins like bacon and okra kind of stuff for more money    Server was sweet but had    tables so It took forever to get our check and the tables around us seemed to be waiting as well  She certainly kept her cool under pressure  It was impressive ,2,2015-06-08
This place was a surprise for me   My wife and I had just arrived in Vegas  were starving  and went into this place without much thought   We were pleasantly surprised by the good drinks and great food   We ended up coming back here again for lunch later in our trip     The shepherd s pie here is excellent  with lots of flavor and great texture   It s not the typical browned  ground meat you get in most other places   The fish and chips are great too  although not particularly different from any other good fish and chips place you might go to   The lobster sliders are good but I thought they skimped a bit on the lobster   One thing any of age person has to try is Todd s sssSweet Tea   This bourbon cocktail is amazing  and very dangerous   I could drink these all day  and will probably come back here on my next Vegas trip just to get this drink ,4,2012-06-25
Mediocre food  Had fish and chips  Fish was overcooked and coating was charred  Chips were soggy and flavorless  Kitchen was SLOW  It took over an hour from when we were seated until we were served our entree  This might be a good place if you want to drink a lot of beer and don t care when your food arrives or what it tastes like ,2,2011-04-16
We came here because I heard they served a mean lobster roll    Let s put it this way  I d never order the lobster roll again  It was more like a roll with a bit of lobster  You are served   of them on a thick Hawaiian type roll   The duck buns to start were great  as was the complimentary popcorn that lasted about   seconds    The atmosphere is open and large but overall I d didn t love this restaurant and highly preferred Todd English Olives at Bellagio for lunch ,3,2011-10-23
So good Its one of the reasons I came back to Vegas  Just to taste these lobsters rolls again  Phenomenal food  I got the lobster rolls   loaded with chunks of lobster with a Devine aoli and buttery rolls  And they don t cheap out either    rolls super filling  My boyfriend got the Ruben and it was sooo delicious  Also our server was dynamite he found the very first beer I actually liked  He got along really well with my boyfriend and bonded over IPAs lol I hope he sees this because he was a great server  Made our first night  my Bfs first trip  my second  back in Vegas wonderful ,5,2016-03-12
Great drinks and great service  My boyfriend and i went in to drink and watch a Fulham  soccer  game  and we were so pleasantly surprised  They bring out small buckets of popcorn to start your meal  like an italian place would serve bread   Considering that it s a beer heavy bar  I thought it was a great idea  I had one of the nicest waitresses I ve ever had here  I expressed that I wasn t sure what I would order  if anything  and she pointed out what other people were eating and what she liked too   I also thought the placemats were such a great touch  They were pieces of paper with funny  booze related quotes printed all over them   Here was one that cracked me up   When I read about the evils of drinking  I gave up reading   Youngman,4,2012-02-25
This is the best spot in town for a brew  Great selection of draft beer  including several Belgian ales  British ales  US microbrews and seasonal ales   Good bar food also ,5,2012-01-23
What a great vibe this place has     Whether you re dying to try and drink any of their    beers in   seconds so that you can get it for free  eat a famed deconstructed sandwich via their  Carvery  menu offering  sit outside and enjoy the colored water show from the fountain  watch a game at the bar  or just relish the view of the throngs of people walking in  out  and around the place  TEPUB is a place with the pace for enjoyment   I ordered a burger with a GINORMOUS hunk of Humboldt Fog and homemade kettle chips   De lish   I tried a piece of my friend s pastrami meat from his sandwich and found it unreasonably salty   But  then again  I m not a pastrami fan to begin with so I may not be the best tongue   The place scored major points for the extremely attentive bartenders   Those girls are awesome    I was detoxing and rehydrating before consuming more alcohol and I swear  as soon as I drank a glass of water  it was refilled before I could ask   And she just kept checking on us   it was fantastic service   I can only assume that tables received the same attention   You need to go to City Center anyway just to walk around this extremely cool concept of a little City within a City and  when you do  be sure to stop off at Todd English ,4,2010-03-21
Honestly the worst experience we had in Vegas   Waitstaff was SUPER slow  It took us an hour and a half to eat sub par food   My girlfriend ordered a salad to start and beef sliders  I ordered the Carvery   beef brisket on sourdough   An hour after we ordered  drinks long gone and waitress nowhere to be found the food shows up  No dressing on the salad   Sliders were bland  Meh   The Carvery  oz of brisket and   pieces of sourdough that they couldn t be bothered to toast  and   minuscule little sides of sauces    you get to choose    was underwhelming  How bout some fixings  tomatoes  lettuce  what not to maybe make a sandwich  It also came with some gross pickled veggies   BOTTOM LINE  Skip it and do tapas next door,1,2012-10-14
For the money    never again    So its Pub food  and apparently when you put the name Todd English in front of it that means the price is x  of the norm  A     hamburger that although the novelty of it trying to look over sized with the heavy stack of vegetables doesn t help the lack of seasoning in the meat  The fries that came with it were meh  And the shepherd s pie was decent and much better than the burger  but at     i would have much preferred quite a few different options that were not more than a few steps away in Crystals or Aria  After   glasses of house wine  dinner for   was      with tip  Not even a meal i would put in my  decent  list of places that i have eaten  I wouldn t return even if my bill was half what it was  Save the effort and try something else that is near by ,2,2016-04-18
Started with a delicious Bloody Mary  then on to the beef sandwich with Swiss cheese and carmelized onions   Delicious   Hubby had the fish and chips and it was a hardy portion   Overall very good but pricey ,4,2017-09-24
Todd has changed a bit since I last visited   MGM has taken over and it means fewer items on happy hour  but other than that it seemed like before     So  from having all beers on happy hour   now there is a select few only  Too bad  but  hey they still have that extensive beer list  and the atmosphere is the same ,4,2017-07-11
I stopped here for lunch today with my fiance and two of her co workers   We were staying at the Aria and weren t yet ready to head to the airport and so decided on this place   What was nice is that whenever I checked in here on Yelp I got a check in offer for a free bud light   While I am not in any way a bud light fan and often avoid it  I love anything free and so eagerly accepted my beer   Since it was a nice day we decided to sit outside and so I cant really comment on any of the decor inside of the restaurant   For lunch my fiance and I decided to start off our meal by splitting the fried pickles appetizer   We were pleasantly surprised by the mound of pickle chips that came out and were also impressed by the choice of three dipping sauces  a BBQ  a Blue cheese and my favorite  a spicy sauce    The pickles were fried nicely and had a good crisp to them and I enjoyed pairing them with the different sauces   For my lunch entree I decided to go with the Caesar salad after a week of gluttonous eating while my fiance decided on the lobster Cobb salad   She was nice enough to let me enjoy two of the claws and the lobster was good being sweet  tender and seasoned perfectly   My Caesar salad was decent sized although I was a little confused whenever it came out topped with tomatoes   Yes it helped dress up the presentation but I have never seen tomatoes on a Caesar salad before   The salad was also loaded with dressing which I personally love but know that many do not   It tasted decent enough but wasn t anything terribly exciting  not that I was expecting it to be   The bottom line from me is that I would head back here again in the future   It had a great location with outdoor seating in between the Aria and Crystals and some of the food was really good too ,4,2013-09-25
Very disappointing beer list for a  pub   the menu looks intriguing at first  but the more you read  the more you realize around     of the list is typical brands and there are not that many of them  Food was well below the quality of the immediate area   wings were more vinegar than spice and the junk chips were not as unique as they appeared on the menu ,3,2015-02-12
I loved it here mostly because I was not paying for anything and    people ran a       tab but  the drinks were great and the food was pretty good  Do get   Dirty Chips  Mac and cheese  Pretzels  and Duck Buns  I had the brisket platter and it was soso but I was so full from appetizers and drinks they did not get full respect    If you can pound a pint in   seconds it is free and they have nickel PBR on tuesday  So I will be back   I loved it and I love Aria ,4,2011-01-19
Alex was one of the best servers ive had in a long time  Very knowledgable but not overbearing   We liked Alex and the atmosphere  but the food was average  if not a bit overpriced   The second time we visited  again there was good service and good beers available but the food was underwhelming   When you put your name a restaurant in Vegas  the food better be the main event   The chicken pot pie was okay   Good but didn t blow me away   My wife and sister in law had some carved meats that later gave them both heart burn   We sent an appetizer back  and the manager came over to check in on us   Good service there   Instead of removing the item from our bill he wanted to take care of us and sent over a deep fried halibut   It was this enormous deep fried piece of fish that looked like a football   Not what we needed   It was a good piece of fish  but man that thing was a huge fried turd   Overall  I d say go for the beer and location  but eat dinner somewhere else ,3,2011-04-18
This is a great modern iteration of the classic pub    Todd English has brought gourmet to pub and the result is a fun and tasty experience   The beer selections are fantastic   Lots of interesting options  now including Napa Smith Organic IPA     Food   Must try the pretzels with cheese  the pot sticker apptzer   Also sliders and of course fish n chips   We had table of   and ordered a bunch of stuff to share   Go into this thinking  pub food with flair    Will definitely be back ,4,2011-10-20
I didn t have a good experience at this restaurant  First  I think the name  gastropub  is thrown around a little loosely these days  I noted a few items hinting at creativity  but mainly the menu is bar appetizers  burgers and some British food  Creed and Maroon   on the sound system  and enough  flair  on the wall to make you feel like you are in a British TGI Fridays  not a hole in the wall British Pub    Went for lunch and the place was not packed at all  Despite seeing several servers walking around  waited a good    minutes for a water and a menu  The following was ordered  buffalo burger medium  substitue horseradish sauce instead of bleu cheese  and sweet potato fries     minutes later  place is almost empty  food arrives by a different server who puts it down without saying anything and walks away  Food consists of a small patty of well done meat on a very large  somewhat burned bun  I am not sure of there burger weight  but putting it on a bun twice the size does not help with any sort of illusion  Large hunk of bleu cheese  but no horseradish anywhere to be found  No one is around and I am starving so I scrape off the cheese and just eat it  Anyone who has had buffalo understands it has a different flavor than beef  I cannot verify this  but I am pretty sure I DIDNT have a buffalo burger    No one checked on me even if I had wanted to say anything  The next time I saw my server he was delivering my unasked for check    This  pub  is exactly the reason I avoid chain restaurants whenever I can    Since I want to be a little nice  if you do want a good beer selection  and even some ciders  this place might be up your alley  Also  the sweet potato fries were good ,1,2011-06-07
Great lobster rolls  The service was excellent  I often recommend Todd English Pub to friends and clients for a great lunch ,4,2016-08-27
There aren t very many low key places to eat   hang out on the strip so P U B  was a welcome change of pace at the end of a long weekend   The place is pretty huge but somehow still manages to have that cozy red British pub vibe   Service is very friendly and accommodating   We had a very large party      yikes    and they were able to seat us together   Two servers took care of our table  and we had no issues with the ordering process or the bill   Impressive   I would say the only place P U B  fell short was the food   With Todd English lending his name to the place  I expected better   The menu reads amazing  but when the food comes out  SURPRISE   It s just typical pub fare   My veggie less Chicken Pot Pie was a flop  as were the not so fresh Fish   Chips   The lobster rolls were sort of bland and borderline soggy   The best thing I tried at the table was a basic Shepherd s Pie    Maybe the carvery is the way to go  choose a meat  bread  and sauces   but it comes with zero vegetables so you have to order those separately     Price wise  beers run around     a pint for most of the microbrews  BUT if you can chug one in   seconds or less  it s free   Hmmm  maybe we should have come here at the beginning of the weekend instead   Expect to drop around     for a beer and a meal here all in    That s practically chump change for dinner in Vegas  plus you can wear shorts and flip flops ,3,2011-07-06
We love Todd English  We usually stay at the Aria so it s out go to for a quick bite  The    oysters with the BEST atomic cocktail sauce and the Lobster Roll are our favorite    This time we also tried the Angry Clams which were amazing     Chorizo  wine base  butter  spice and lobster what else could a girl ask for      But wait it s served with grilled buttery bread     The lobster roll comes with   mini buttery grilled New England type buns  The lobster is more of a butter base rather than mayo which I prefer  Never disappoints ,4,2016-07-06
This restaurant had a friendly  clean  eclectic environment   There were many good food and drink options  We took advantage of the   wings for    deal  you could order as many you wanted at that rate  We bought sliders which were half off     a pop and an entire size ceaser salad to share  I had a couple half off Blanco sangria s and my husband ordered the two for one beer deal  Prices for the specialty brews were little high  but OK if you are just looking to sit around and sip with friends  We enjoyed going to this restaurant so much  that we decided to repeat the experience the next day ,4,2017-01-22
Stopped here for some oysters before Cirque s Elvis show   They were    each and they were beautiful  OMG  we could have eaten them for days   The sauces they came with were delicious too  Can t wait to go back and try other dishes ,4,2012-06-08
 In Todd We Trust    Although that is a hilarious sentiment  its something I can stand behind when it comes to the food at this restaurant  Yuuuummy   I went for lunch here on New Years day with my bestie and my appetite firmly in tow   We tried everything   even PBR in a wine glass   There is nothing I didn t like   from the pork buns to the sliders to the Lobster poppie  for which I am currently Jones ing      My only complaint is  now that you got me hooked on PBR in a wine glass and that gooey lobster delight  what am I going to do now that I can t get it here in New York  Todd  P U B N Y C   Brilliant  I want     ,4,2011-01-21
The checkin clerk at the Aria recommended this place and it was our first meal in Vegas   Lobster rolls are a must have here   They are so buttery and fresh   The barreled beer is something to try if you never have   Being from Portland and being an Oregon beer  Deshutes   I couldn t resist    Warning  it comes warm and is a little bitter  but a good change if you enjoy the micros     second beer drop and it s free  limit two   Guy next to us dropped one and got it free  he wanted me to join in his second  but by no means am I a speed drinker  but he insisted and paid  but I only got through half   The best Bloody Mary anywhere on the strip  wife made us go back three times just to get these   We had at least one at each of the resturaunts bars we went   It has two entrances  one in the courtyard between Aria and Crystals  the other is inside Crystals,4,2013-03-08
Had dinner at Tod s English Pub Monday Night  Stop by at late night Happy Hour        pm  for Half Price Sliders and drinks  Got seated quickly  waiter then informed us that they stop Happy Hour  Which we stated was on menu board out side entrance    Waiter said sorry so we changed our meal  to prime  rib sandwich  Onion rings and Blood Mary  and there Salad and glass of wine  Food came quickly and was Average nothing outstanding  Bloody Mary was Below average I always on look out for the best Bloody Marys   There was Bland and not not Flavor   So dinner was just OK    then when we got check waiter told us SORRY that they still have Happy Hour but he didn t know about it    TO TODD ENGLISH MANAGEMENT   your servers should know what going on in your restaurant  during thier shifts   TOO many other good service restaurants around for your Dollar,2,2015-09-02
I tripped across this place while looking for somewhere to eat  I read the menu and saw they had  Firestone  Beer  that was all I needed to see  The food was pretty good  I ate at the bar so service was prompt  I looked through their other beers and was extremely impressed  They have the Best beer selection in all of Las Vegas that I ve seen so far  It is pretty expensive though  I highly recommend this place any anyone who knows good beer ,4,2012-12-14
We loved our server Melissa    The All About Mary Bloody Mary was fabulous     It was my friends birthday and we went there to celebrate   It was great    Will go again   ,5,2016-08-29
Great atmosphere and beer selection   I ordered the sausage and pepper sliders which were outstanding    My buddy ordered lobster rolls which were also good   Only complaint was portions were a little small   Great place for lunch  late night snack and beer ,4,2010-08-16
Staying at the  Death Ray   Vdara   and wanted someplace for lunch   The City Center  complex  has turned  apparently  into a home away from home for us    last time we were at the Mandarin Oriental  and  Crystals  is the adjoining shopping center mall where Todd English s P U B  is located   My wife and I checked out the menu prior to leaving Berkeley  and knew this would be a great spot for lunch         Todd English is like the under the radar Bobby Flay   Aside from the Home Shopping Network  or is it QVC    you really don t see him on television much  but between Olive s  Figs  and who knows what else  he s everywhere   But this is his first and  to date  only PUB  or Public Urban Bar      Countless beers on tap    I think over       including some cask conditioned ales  yes    the food is close to perfect  and the portions are HUGE   Lynn and I made the delicious mistake of ordering too much food  and thank heavens reinforcements arrived to help us finish   We had something called  Dirty Chips     America s answer to nachos  this is sinfully good and truly dangerous   Kettle chips tossed in bleu cheese  bits of amazingly delicious bacon  scallions  and served with fried chicken livers       just add beer and a football game and you re in heaven  albeit on a rapid descent to hell  if your doctor ever finds out     Seriously delicious  but don t order this unless you can share it with at least three other people    And if you try it on your own  make sure to have one of those defibrillators they have in airports at the ready    The iceberg wedge with bleu cheese and a bacon vinaigrette  avocado  tomato  and chopped egg is a classic  and served ice cold  the duck buns  three to an order  with shredded duck  hoisin and scallions were better than they had a right to be  delicious  though better at a true dim sum palace  to be honest    And then  we moved onto the mains         Lynn had the pastrami sliders    three excellent little sandwiches on rye parker house rolls  with kraut  swiss cheese and served with skinny fries       OK  I had one of the three   I opted for the brown butter lobster rolls    three rolls filled with freshly shucked lobster  warm brown butter aioli  served with slaw and kettle chips    as if we hadn t had enough of those already   All this paired beautifully with pints of Chimay white  in the proper glasses  BTW     a very filling  but very delicious lunch   In fact  it s almost noon as I write this       maybe I ll have lunch there today  too   Two more notes       Good for kids   as always  will depend more upon the kids than the restaurant        As for the bathroom attendant       yeah  that has to stop ,4,2010-10-15
Very good food and good beer   Cozy atmosphere  and good service   Felt like good ole Chicago ,4,2012-12-15
Great place to stop in for a beer and some great pub food  but the bill will definitely creep up and kick you in the ass     for a Pabst Blue Ribbon   Shah right  Thankfully the Yelp  check in netted us complimentary Corona Lights  which went extremely well with the free popcorn  We ended up trying the Junk Chips  Bologna Sandwich  and Lobster Rolls  The Junk Chips were fantastic   tasted like a Sloppy Joe on steroids  refusing to release its grasp of my fingers and stomach  The Bologna Sandwich wasn t really what I was expecting  Housemade meat was far from reminiscent of legendary bologna I ve had in Louisville and Michigan  Too much bread and an unpleasant horseradish mustard sauce really brought the sammie down  The Lobster Rolls were more than I expected  A stout amount of lobster was packed into the three rolls  making for a pretty filling dish  Flavorsome seasoning and sauce helped the rolls achieve solid heights  Definitely worth checking out for an original  jacked up approach to traditional pub fare  but the gouged food and drink prices  I d hesitate to stop back unless I was on a serious heater ,4,2015-06-02
Love the happy hour specials here    wings and half off pints of beer      Also the duck cakes are amazing     junk chips have to be my favorite     Only draw back I would say is  consistency on wings     One day they are huge one day they are small     Other than that great place to grab a drink and have fun with friends,4,2013-10-18
Well the wife and I have been to Todd English Pub on about   or   occasions  Overall  the pros are their happy hours  when draft beer and wines by the glass are half price  They also have some food specials during happy hour  It s also a pretty happening place  because people from everywhere flock to get cheap craft beer on the Strip   The decor is nice and sitting at the bar is my preferred choice if it s available  As a whole  I have never been excited about the food here  The service is great  but other than the raw oysters and the fries  nothing really stands out as far as food  My other pet peeve is that they don t really replace their beers when they kick  unless they have another keg of the same beer  Invariably  I wind up ordering a few beers only to find out that they are out of it    Oh well  cheap beer on the Strip is still cool  but I will likely eat elsewhere ,3,2014-03-31
Decent service  High prices  Good proximity  Decent food     My beers were a great deal  Two    oz domestics for   bucks  Now  my husband unfortunately ordered two IPAs for    bucks a pop  would have been   bucks at the most in good old Kentucky  We quickly found out these were Vegas prices     The fish and chips were average  My prime rib sandwich was good  Not legendary  Both meals were more than    bucks each  Ouch  Granted most of the food I had in Vegas was so  so AND expensive  ish  for what it was     Lots of TVs  Easy to find a seat  Near a lot of the main attractions  A good place to have a meal if you want to eat close to your hotel or for a snack ,3,2016-11-04
Went in  waited   minutes for just water n utensils  Another    minutes for the waiter to tell us they ran out of the  filthy chicken  appetizer we ordered  and another    minutes for Chicken Wings to arrive  Confirmed  Delirium Tremmens on Draft for      Ordered it  sat next to the bar saw the bartender poured it  Salivated for another    minutes just for our waiter to bring it over  while the other servers just stood there and watched the game and chat  Food ain t bad but the service is not even remotely representative of  strip  quality  It s amazing how they are overstaffed and no body is doing  hit  Bottom line  when you re around Chrystal Mall or Aria  GO EAT ELSE WHERE before shopping ,2,2010-03-31
This was probably the best meal we had while in Vegas in August        not to say you should expect this to be YOUR best meal  just ours because it seemed like we ate crappy food constantly   the Aria Buffet was BLAH  Jean Philippe pastry was okay  and the Aria Caf  was average   We didn t want to venture too far from where we were staying because it was brutally hot   Lesson learned  we will seek out better food next time   We came during happy hour which was great  half price beer  We each had the pub burger  it was flavorable and HUGE  and the fries were really good  One beer each and one burger each  which tip  set us back only       I call that a fare deal ,4,2014-10-06
We went back for happy hour the day after our first visit   Pints were half price and cheap er  beer always make me happy   We ordered the Oysters Rockefeller and they were amazing   I could have eaten the spinach topping with a spoon  I really enjoy the atmosphere of this place   It was comfortable  sports were on tv and the service was quick and friendly ,4,2011-12-14
Hands down The worst food I ve eaten in Vegas  Wish I would have taken a photo of my food  Had chicken wings come out that were cold plus the carrots and celery looked like they had been sitting out for a week  When I went to tell the server she grabbed the dish before I could even tell her my problem  Making me believe she already was aware of the quality of the food on my plate ,1,2016-02-27
Two words  Lobster Rolls  Go for the lobster rolls   Warm  buttery goodness just waiting to get into your mouth  Complete legit  The waitress had said that people come there for these little buns of deliciousness and now that I ve tried them  I am definitely doing the same even though it is a little pricey   If you don t like the coleslaw that it comes with  you can always substitute it with something else for a small additional cost  I got a side salad instead    The service was great at the bar  It has a pub atmosphere obviously  but it didn t feel loud or obnoxious  Great place to just chill with your friends with a sporting event on the tv while enjoying a beer in one hand and roll in the other ,5,2017-07-12
    beers on tap  well no rotational and seasonals  oh but  we have none of those today  how bout a cold Especial until we can decide   sorry just ran out  well how bout a beer menu of what you do have   You guys giving up on us   Yes  but obviously we weren t the ones who ve given up  And we walked a mile for this place posing as a pub ,2,2015-09-19
I was in Vegas for   days this month and every day included at least one visit to Todd English P U B  My husband and I loved the food and the atmosphere unlike most restaurants and bars in Vegas  Todd English actually has windows  and light  We didn t feel like we were in a cave or that is was the middle of the night in the middle of the day  Just an overall fun atmosphere with great staff to boot   Onto their food    they know how to do bar food right  The Lobster Rolls are a must warm and buttery with big chunks of fresh lobster so delicious  We also tried the loaded chips that are HUGE and very tasty  The footlong hot dog with chili looked ridiculously good along with pretty much everything else that came out of the kitchen  They also have an awesome Bloody Mary cart on the weekends where you can create your very own bloody with anything your heart desires pickled green beans  bacon  cheese  carrots  celery  housemade infused vodkas    the list goes on  and on  and on these creations are like a meal in a glass and the perfect way to start a day in Sin City  Lots of TVs  good crowd  definitely worth a visit ,4,2013-10-21
This place is located right between Aria and the absurdly expensive shopping mall in Citycenter   I ve had uneven experiences at Todd English establishments  which is becoming more and more common in celebrity chef places   But P U B  was excellent   What a cool place to get a casual meal  have a beer and maybe watch a game   It s similar to other gastro pubs I ve been to  but the execution was excellent   The carver concept   essentially a make your own sandwich board   was simple and good   Pretty much everything we had was very good to excellent   The chocolate chip cookie that came with my friend s artisan bologna sandwich  I stole a piece  was surprisingly sub par   The only other reason P U B  didn t earn the fifth star was the service  it was kind of unfriendly   All in all  I really liked this place and would definitely go back   I hope they can keep the performance up ,4,2010-11-21
Recently got away from the hustle and bustle of LA  to find myself in the gamblers mecca  Upon my recent Vegas trip  I decided to try a new place since it was close to where I was staying  The restaurant was very nice with an oyster bar at the actual bar  I met some really cool individuals here  Drinks kept on flowing and all the bartenders seemed to really be happy to be there  I tried their beef sliders and they were super juicy  I d come back again ,4,2016-01-11
Time to update    Keeping this at a solid   stars    the Happy Hour specials   p  p     p   a  are excellent  Half price beers  great beer list   and    oysters  Sign this girl up  We tried to go here at   pm one night  but they told us the kitchen was closed  so just note that the   am end on the happy hour may not be      accurate   I had the lobster tacos   some oysters during this visit  The tacos were OK  next time I d get something different  but the oysters were fresh   were really great  Our server was super nice   we had a great time for our  last supper  in Vegas ,4,2014-07-18
Ate here twice during a recent visit to LV    Great food   great staff   Super helpful in navigating significant drink and food options   Typical overpriced LV though  Perhaps        inflated just because it is inside of ARIA ,4,2014-11-22
As a vegas local  this is my favorite place to go on the strip  The food is absolutely amazing  and fair priced  And the staff is knowledgeable and attentive  By far  Tim has given me the best service I ve received at a restaurant in vegas  Sit at the bar  ask for tim  and order the oysters   You won t be dissapointed ,5,2015-09-07
Great place for a beer and food   Crappy soundtrack    Feels like I am riding in the car with my nine year old ,3,2015-05-06
I wouldn t go here unless I only wanted to drink  Very loud  The fish and chips were overcooked and the turkey from the carvery was disappointing  The sides of pickles  coleslaw and fries none were worth eating  They do appear to have a large beer selection ,2,2011-03-18
Came here for lunch  Great atmosphere  good food  nice staff  overpriced for what it is  We had a great time  really enjoyed ourselves  I had the fish and chips  he had the prime rotisserie sandwich  Both were good  just pricey as it is on the strip and a big name on it  Worth going to once ,4,2017-09-05
Hung out at this place twice during a   day stay at Aria   Cannot beat the happy hour prices and selection   Honestly I m so thankful we found this place when we did so we didn t have to pay the typical vegas drink prices   Also loved the discounted wings for happy hour  nice sized     The rest of the food was a bit pricey for the quality  but that s Vegas for you   Had the tomato onion salad which was fine    overdresses and small   The patra minis were tasty but also just ok   But the drinks make up for the shortcomings   Service was great too ,4,2013-11-19
I went there for my Birthday   I wanted casual  fun and also good   I got what I wanted   This is PUB food on steroids   It has an extensive beer list and traditional pub food but with a gastro spin   I was there with three other people and we all left fully stuffed and satisfied with everything we had   The waitress was very friendly and let us take our time with having a few drinks and then ordering appetizers and going from there ,4,2012-07-27
I wish this would open in NYC   Came in with a big group for lunch  but ended up staying for a few hours  They have beer taps built into tables  modernized comfort food favorites  and an extensive beer list  Typically  I would order beer at a pub  but I couldn t resist the strawberry mojito  It might just be the best I have ever had  Food was delicious too   I definitely reccomend PUB ,4,2012-08-23
This place was amazing  Would have been   stars  but their drinks were over priced  I guess they feel they have a captive audience  but there are other pubs in Vegas  Service was excellent   both attentive and friendly  Servings were generous  especially on the apps there was enough for a group to share  Had the fried pickles and lobster roll   Delicious  I will definitely come back when next in Vegas ,4,2014-04-04
I m still at   stars for this place  Love the decor and atmosphere  but everything continues to be just a ok   The beer list  while good  is actually a bit underwhelming  In fact  I think it has shrunk instead of grown  But it is one of the few places around Vegas where I can get a Timmermans   After them being out of wings the first time I attempted to have them here  I finally did actually have them on my last visit  They were good  but not great  I liked the presentation of them  The breading was eh  The flavor was decent  but not spicy enough  The blue cheese was great ,3,2012-01-31
Where else can you find a     pitcher of PBR   served by a pretentious bartender    The prices are ridiculous and the service isn t too good either   Even happy hr isn t worth it   Didn t even get to the food whats the point ,1,2011-09-22
  stars for food    minus   star for service   A customizable bloody mary menu    sign me up over and over again    I m a new fan   Came here for my final meal before my flight back home  and one person in our party was insistent on finding a place to eat that would allow her to watch her beloved Eagle s game so we walked around a while to find a place that fit both and could fit us in around the Aria  where we were staying   and Todd English P U B  was the perfect fit   Despite a packed restaurant  we were cordially greeted by a nice hostess and were seated after a brief    minute wait   Water came quickly to our table  however it took ages for our waitress to come to our table   After she took   orders from our table  she walked away having being pulled away to take care of another table s check who had been waiting over    minutes to receive their bill so they could pay and leave   So we ended up having to wait even longer for our food to be ordered   When the waitress finally came back after waiting for another    minutes one person had a question about the brunch items on the menu  mind you we came in     hours before brunch ended on Sundays  and our waitress again stopped taking orders and walked away as she didn t know the time and how late brunch wasn t offered  hello it s on the menu    we had cell phones and watches to give you the time    Finally our waitress came back and we were able to get our orders in  and we made the brunch window  and a few of us had fun customizing our bloody marys   The waitress who took our order for the bloody marys was super helpful  she guided us through everything and answered the ton of questions we had   Luckily  the time for our food to arrived was minimal   I ordered the lobster eggs benedict and it was super delicious and beyond stuffing   My bloody mary was amazing   I normally am not a huge fan of bloody mary s  but I m glad I reserved judgement and tried it out   So for anyone who wants a place with casual dining and great food I would highly recommend it ,4,2013-10-03
I go to Vegas     times a year and have enjoyed many of Todd English s restaurant s all over the country   This was my first visit to PUB and all I can say is WOW   I didn t know what to expect from this place but it became clear to me how perfect this restaurant was in every way   The location is great  easy to get to from Aria  the Crystals  the Cosmopolitan and the Strip   The atmosphere is casual and it is perfect for Vegas   It envelopes you  takes over you  and is easy to get into the relaxed  casual  PUB atmosphere that so many other restaurants try so hard to replicate but none get as good as English   But don t be fooled  because I haven t mentioned the food yet  and the food is the STAR of the show   I had an order of dumplings that were better than Wing Lei at the Wynn   The burgers are delicious and the entrees as good as any of the more  formal  restaurants around town  including English s own Olives at the Bellagio   So even if you are not a drinker  this place is for you   But if you do drink  the beer list is incredible   This restaurant fires on all cylinders and is now permanently on my must go list for any Vegas trip   It is equally appropriate for guys night out  a couple s date  a family dinner   solo dining   No other restaurant can do all that ,5,2011-11-30
Todd English s PUB is a fun place to visit in Vegas  They have a great beer selection  draught   not your typical American crap lagers  This was the first place I tried Innis and Gunn  a Scottish beer  and they served it at the perfect temperature  Of all the other places I ve had it  no one comes close to serving it right    The happy hour prices are awesome      off draught beers  Prices are otherwise high  lots of draughts start at        but  as previously mentioned  they are good beers  lots of craft and European beers   You also get to sample their draught beers  so you don t have to blindly commit to a random beer you may not like  I have only sat at the bar  so I have never eaten food here  I can t comment on the food  but it appears their raw seafood bar is popular    The service at the bar has always been the same  Every time we go  my gf and I  our bartender will take a while to actually serve us  not too long  but longer than expected with the number of patrons that are present  and they won t be too talkative  However  the longer we stay the nicer they get  They are very informative on their beers and offer samples to the beers we are interested in trying  We have not met one bad bartender and we  honestly  have loved each bartender that has helped us  In fact  even the dishwasher at the bar was informative and very helpful as well    The only reason I give this place    star is for the price outside of happy hour  I understand it s Vegas and it s located within their high end mall  but the prices are still extravagant  The PUB at Monte Carlo next door has a great selection of beers also  but they are not nearly as expensive  Regardless  this is a great establishment with great beer and wonderful service  I would recommend this place to anyone and have made this a place that I will frequent anytime I m in Vegas ,4,2013-12-29
My wife and just had lunch   Fantastic experience  The food and drink were excellent    What so much made the day came from two of the most positive  customer focused  fun people I have ever had the pleasure to meet   Eleanor Armstrong and Laura Berger   Definitely would recommend   I will return and expect another terrific time   Be sure to ask for Eleanor and Laura ,5,2012-08-15
Todd English is alright  Sure  they have a lot of microbrews  however  I don t think I ever spent more on a microbrew before  It is best to come here for the twice daily happy hour to get     off beer on tap   The food is also okay  I ordered some chicken sliders  which were just okay  My girlfriend and I also ordered some appetizer  but I can t remember now ,3,2012-05-29
A big  meh   I don t see why people are raving about this place  I like bars and pubs with  beer foods  but this ain t it  Nothing I ve tried impressed me  Ok  the size of the foot long hot dog was impressive  actually  it s more intimidating  but the taste left much much to be desired  The fries were mediocre  And I m a fries lover  Pass ,2,2013-02-22
Great venue  pretty good service   Great menu   Las Vegas prices but not out of sight   We sat outside for dinner and were comfortable even though it had been a hot summer day   Prime rib sandwich       excellent   Lobster rolls        also excellent ,4,2015-07-29
Stumbled out of our hotel and into this place   Nice and relaxing pub with a great beer selection   Shawna and Aggie kept us entertained and beers in hand  Cant ask for much more ,5,2017-05-27
Good service  Wide range of choice on menu  Food well prepared and delivered promptly  Background music a little loud  Overall  well priced  value for money and good experience ,4,2015-01-05
Fun atmosphere  the food was great   everything on the menu was delicious including the cocktails   Will definitely come back,5,2015-12-22
My review is based on happy hour which they have twice during the day  During happy hour   prices are really good on beer  As they have a huge selection of beers   this is the place for beer nerds  Moreover   they serve sliders and oysters as part of their happy hour so no worries if hungry    I really recommend sitting by the bar since it may get lively there   Also   they have the best  free  peanuts    The servers are fair and nice  I got served late and got my beer for free  Not bad   eh ,5,2016-08-05
Would have been great except the don t accept Todd English Gift Cards    makes No Sense to me   ,3,2013-05-11
What an awesome place     Our waiter was super nice   Even though I just forgot her name  lol   SORRY       Lots of fun    Make sure you go there during happy hour for discounted goodies   ,5,2013-02-25
I love the dirty chips  If i split that with a friend i usually cannot eat anything else  some of the other appetizers are lacking     the fresh fish is a     The beer selection is awesome  somewhat over priced  i have to say thats the only reason i dont go there so much  if i could I would   nom nom     Staff has always been friendly to me  it gets busy  but we all have to understand what its like when a place is packed things will take some time ,4,2012-10-14
I have been wanting to try this place since it opened  so when my friend was in town visiting and we were going to Haze that night and needed a place to have dinner first well it just seemed that  the stars have finally aligned for me   The place it s self looked nice   I know it s called a Pub  but by the looks it is definitely a restaurant first     Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu   I had the Lobster roll and it was good   I was expecting something different it ended being what you would call maybe Lobster roll sliders still good  but not what I expected   For dessert I had the chocolate cake and I must say it was very good extremely rich   The highlight of my experience was on my way out I took the beer chug challenge   To be honest that was probably the main reason I was there   Well it was a victory for me I got my free beer   I will definitely be back and with the pressure of not having to take the challenge I m sure it will be a greater experience ,4,2011-02-16
This place was amazing   Started with fresh oysters  half East Coast half West Coast   I could have eaten a dozen more   delish  Was torn between the lobster buns and the duck sliders   chose the sliders and they were to  die  for   Tasted like the meat had been marinating for days  full of flavor with a taziki sauce on the side that went very well with the sliders  My brother loves a challenge and of course murdered two beers in way less then the   seconds given    seconds or less free beer    drink max  lol   he could have went all night   Weather was great   all around awesome   ,5,2013-10-19
I really hate giving these types of reviews but when its  that bad     It was about  pm on a Saturday afternoon there was a good amount of people in the place  but it definitely wasn t busy  Even though it wasn t busy it still the the lady behind the bar took forever to get me a menu and even longer to ask me if I was ready  I ordered my beer  I ordered my food then sat there for about another   min    Finally when my food came it looked amazing and all of the bad that just happened didn t matter     until I bit into my burger  It might as well been made from a solid block of salt  it was that salty  When I say that I m not exaggerating when I say this  I ve never had anything that salty in my life    I ask the woman for the check  I didn t ask them totake the food back  she noticed I had only taken one bite and at least took it off my bill  without my asking   At least she tried to make it right but it was too late  I was starving to begin with  and I left just as hungry     It sucks because my local friend said it was a good place to grab a burger  just not for me    not that day at least  Maybe I ll try it again but not any time soon ,1,2011-05-30
BLOODY MARY all the way   Normally when we go to Vegas we stay up way to late drinking adult soda s and the next day I barely have the desire to live   This year we hit this pub every day between about   am  pm for a nice rich bloody mary   The tomato juice is thick  robust and full of flavor and the pickled vegetables they use are incredible   It was by far the best bloody mary I ve ever had and I will gladly look forward to hitting this place up in future trips   Good ambiance  clean pub and great service ,4,2015-03-24
BEST lobster roll I have ever had  This beats what we have in the Bay Area  I loved the bread I loved the lobster  whatever else was in it     was amazing  and the cole slaw   AMAZING  My friends and I went here a few days in a row during EDC week and we just had to do it over and over and over  Lol  The waitress last Saturday was really nice to us  but I forgot her name  Anyway  I would definitely come back ,5,2015-06-26
was five stars all day long     and then you guys took sweet potato fries off the menu    why          please bring back the sweet potato fries     ,3,2017-07-02
This is my  rd time at Todd s pub  This time we came for happy hour  Loved the chicken wings and the oysters   Wife had the lobster cob salad  lots of lobster on top  Unfortunately our waitress was horrible  I hate when they become so nice when they bring the check ,3,2013-11-09
I love coming to this place  They have a great selection of beer and the food is great as one would expect from a Todd English establishment     The beer selection has a lot of good permanent and rotating choices from prominent breweries   The service is great and the bartenders are knowledgeable about the available beers   As far as food I really like the Lobster Roll and the burgers   Can t go wrong with burgers and brew   You can snack on the peanuts while you wait for your food ,4,2015-07-07
Stopped by here to check it out while walking around on the strip with my husband   We had just come from a high end stop  so that might have influenced my perception of this place   I saw several copper cups lined up on the bar  so I went with a Moscow mule   I actually enjoyed the drink because the ice was crushed to an almost slushy like consistency    We ordered pretzels and they were not too great   Took a while to come from the kitchen and they were a little hard  so it appeared that they were not to fresh   Shortly after we arrived it was last call  so that was all we got there   There are many items on their menu that we didn t try  so on another visit I might have a different opinion   Not sure I would come back here for second time voluntarily  though   I m being a little generous with the four  I think a     is more accurate for our experience ,4,2017-07-18
We struck gold again at Todd English  Sat at the bar  were greeted by Ryan the bartender      However  Eleanor and Garrett were very accommodating and very very nice     We had oysters on the half shell  shrimp and drinks   amazing   The service was out of this world  and so friendly  The food was amazing but the company with all of the bar staff made it incredible   Definitely will be coming back when I m in Vegas ,5,2014-07-25
Vegas buffets are glorious and all  but i didn t feel like losing all self esteem before going out one particular night  so I came to check out Todd English P U B  Good food  Great beer selection  Tons of TV to watch any games while you eat  However  prices will keep me from visiting this place too often in the future   The environment is loud and fun  I really liked the place mats because they had quotes praising the awesomeness of alcohol  My favorite was by Frank Sinatra saying  I feel sorry for people who don t drink  When they wake up in the morning  that s as good as they re going to feel all day     Now the food  We came for happy hour  so the sliders and oysters are HH prices   Sliders        The meat is cooked great  which is sometimes hit and miss when dealing with sliders  The buns are soft and buttery  Great slider  but   dollars is a steep price to pay for such a small thing   Oysters        I was unimpressed with the oysters  They didn t taste fresh  and it felt really water y  No brine y or sweet burst of flavor  The cocktail sauce was good  but I think a good oyster needs to be able to stand on its own   Lobster Roll         Soft  toasty and buttery texas toast  Succulent lobster meat  The lobster roll was fantastic  Again  the price is steep at      but of the three things I tried  the lobster roll was the most worth the price   Also  beers are half priced during happy hour  which is great because the selection is extensive ,3,2013-01-23
Came across this pub on accident    We tried going to wolf gang pucks  unfortunately they were closed and we came here   They have an awesome happy hour and our waiter chris oneil was superb  We would definitely cone back and dine here again   Lobster roll is on point and the burger was so juicy   Definitely give this place a try ,5,2013-11-28
The worst food and service ever  Mada a complaint never got a call back to correct the bad service ,1,2016-08-17
Great service  great food  but came for happy hour  mainly oysters  and the food is the same price as the regular menu prices  Misleading  Local  probably won t come back ,2,2015-06-05
Great food and service  I love their Dirty chips and lobster roll  It is on a pricey side  Happy hour between    to   PM and    to Midnight    Highly recommend this place ,4,2013-08-14
PUB is Such a great find  They have custom     bloody mary s so Evan and Andrea seemed to enjoy spending    minutes with the kilted  Bloody Mary Girl  picking out their combo  Perhaps this had something to do with her giant bazoombas  Mor me     hours of straight Vegas binge drinking and the very thought of tomato juice  vodka and spicy made last night s   a m    th meal  begin to re surface   I was really happy I ordered the     lobster roll  it was unbelievable  So much lobster smeared in this flavored butter on crispy bread and with a small accompaniment of fries  though they did give me the wrong kind of fries   I will be craving this meal until my next Vegas trip  Hey Evan  can you pick me up one to go on your way to L A  ,5,2013-08-07
The  Best  Brisket  EVER  Seriously  that stuff is dreamy  Smokey  savory goodness  And a huge huge portion  ALL the food here is in gigantic portions  I could only finish about     of my meat  but the rest of the table happily finished the rest  You can share almost everything on the menu  I saw one of the footlong hotdogs go by  that thing was a bit over a foot and about an inch and a half in diameter  Also  service was great    but the brisket    ,4,2011-04-01
When on the Strip  happy hour at the P U B  is hard to beat  especially when Jaimee is behind the bar   With an infectious smile  she serves up half price pints of delicious brews    including my personal favorite Ballast Point Sculpin IPA   And she makes the seven second challenge  try it with Boddington s  especially fun    so much fun that I did it two days in a row  winning both times   Thanks  Jaimee   Mr English   Give her a raise ,5,2014-11-21
Todd English s Las Vegas  Consistently a great beer bar  On   different visits spread out over a few years  the beer selection has been well worth the walk trip from wherever in Vegas you are staying  Craft beer fans will be satisfied with the mix of local and national craft beers of all sorts  from Belgians to stouts to IPAs to rare releases  Drive has been also friendly but we have always sat at the bar   Food is above average gastropub fare with sliders  etc  good enough to make that where you eat as well as taste fine brews,4,2017-12-31
What a cool place   The vibe really nice  the barstaff is super friendly  This pub has a lot of different things on the menu that all seemed really good  Our bartender recomended the roast beef sliders which were really yummy     and they have quite a draft beer selection      Being a local  this is definetly going to be a place where we ll come often to hang out  ,4,2010-07-11
Free bud light when you check in with yelp     Dollar hot wings after    pm     Skip the oysters because they were not plump and fresh   The sliders are ok   In general  this is a low maintenance place to grab drinks and some food if you are staying at Aria   It s nothing fancy but it s good fun ,4,2013-12-21
Two for the slowness of the kitchen  A one appetizer and two person meal was a two hour event complete with us needing to talk to the manager  They comped a meal to make up for it  but it was just lunch  Is it that hard to keep it together   Wings  as expected  I got the chicken sandwich that was served cold and the bread was so buttery I didn t eat it  The skinny fries were excellent  My bf got the iceberg salad that was typical and the sweet potato fries that he really liked  Great beer selection and with diet cola being       a glass  you re better off buying a beer ,2,2012-04-15
Pretty expensive  The food was pretty good  yet overpriced  The beer was way over priced   even for happy hour  We actually found a pub closer to the T mobile Arena that was a bit cheaper,3,2016-07-18
Never going back    Seemed like a chill place but some waiter waiter was extremely rude you don t need that spend your money elsewhere ,1,2015-09-29
Great happy hour from    pm   another that starts at     All wine  beer    champagne by the glass is half off  Pretty much can t go wrong with any of the food on the menu you choose however  the stand out for me are the lobster rolls  Amazing ,5,2014-07-31
Good beer and whiskey selection  Very limited happy hour and food is meh  The     avocado toast feels out of place  the menu is definitely not good for a full meal but just to keep you going as you drink  Lots of TVs but this place doesn t have a  special  feel anymore ,4,2017-12-23
Lobster cobb salad left a lot to be desired    OVERPRICED for what you get  To be expected really in Vegas ,2,2015-08-21
Get the lobster rolls  They are amazing  Sweet  buttery  juicy goodness     I eat a lot of delicious things  and these made me want to eat nothing else for a week  And feed them to all the people I love  They are that good    try them  Just save me some   I did see a giant beer glass with a mini Corona sticking out when I was there last  which seems to be a trend in Vegas  I couldn t figure out if it came from TEB  If it did  I would have to dock them a star  Hopefully it was from somewhere else on the strip and the trend disappears by the time I go back ,5,2012-10-08
The Lobster Rolls are the best we have ever had  Lots of chunks of juicy lobster stuffed inside this crispy buttery bread  Waffles fries were amazing as well as the cole slaw  And also the bloody mary was completely flavorful and perfectly spicy ,5,2014-05-01
Prior to my visit today this place was a must  That was when you could fill out a Bloody Mary card and build a Bloody Mary with a ton of different toppings and infusions  We were told today that they stopped doing it that was an you can buy one of two options  It wasn t the same  The service was good so no complaints there but not a must stop anymore ,2,2017-01-08
My husband and I are here because of the close proximity to the Aria and we just didn t want to take lyft again  We started with clam chowder and Caesar salad  Soup was pretty tasty but not worth      Caesar was eh   then we shared the fish and chips which was      They were kinda disappointing and the fries were cold and soggy  Our bill was      and not worth it at all  Stay away ,3,2017-08-11
There s only so much I can judge a place by when my order consists of  Corn Dog Puppies  but this is where we are in life   Todd English P U B  got my attention when someone sent out a tweet mentioning their Tuesday night PBR special     cents per   ounce PBR   Basically they re giving it away   I didn t go during this event but I might return in the future to check it out   Instead I just went during a less than peak traffic period to get a taste for the place   It s located in the bowels of CityCenter  which now features hit and miss iphone  G coverage    An improvement over the  might as well just leave the phone in the car  coverage    Things I liked    The staff is super friendly    They serve Molson Canadian    A good range of bar food appetizers  to seafood  to burgers and fries    Free popcorn while you wait   Things I don t like    Kinda pricey     for some mini corn dogs and a few fries  But I guess I should have expected as such dining at a new place with a celeb chef name at the most over the top location on the strip    I know the place serves fish  but does the smell need to overpower the venue    Kinda felt like the staff is pressured to upsell   I just want a brief snack appetizer   Don t need to be questioned repeatedly if I want to order more stuff   I could see myself coming back if I had some money to burn and want to have a good meal   I saw some dishes being taken to other guests and the presentation looks excellent ,3,2010-04-21
Went to Todd English while at a trade show  To my surprise they have a drink challenge where you can win free beer  Aggie our bartender was awesome and attentive  This is a place I will definitely come back to next time I m in Vegas ,5,2017-03-09
Another good experience at Todd  This place is a little out of the way being tucked back up in the Aria  But it is certainly worth the extra steps for those not staying on site  Like any good pub  they have a wide selection of beers  Plus lots of variety on their menu  Service this trip was good  but not great  The food continues to be top notch ,4,2014-11-04
I was in Vegas for work   but wanted to have a nice meal    my fiends and I came here as a sort of last resort after  lemongrass  had disappointed us with having a broken down kitchen     we saw the        Beer   sign at this pub and decided that sounded great   We waited for about    mins to be seated  even though it wasn t even that crowded    our server decided to come to our table after   more people had already come and did stuff   I kinda wish the bus boys would have been our server instead because this girl was awful  I get that sometimes you really don t give a s  t about your customers sometimes  as a server  I was a server for several years  but at least PRETEND  Put on that fake smile    This girl didnt even care that she made it completely obvious that she didn t care about us   She clearly cared more about the    top full of males who would tip her based on the fact that she was a remotely attractive female      After sitting there for    mins  we were finally asked if we d like drinks   we excitedly asked about the    beer    oh   we re actually out of that  and she didn t really give us any other options    thankfully YELP  Actually had a  free pint beer  check in offer  but it was of BUD which I HATE  but oh well   my        hot wings were the quality of Buffalo Wild Wings   which I could have gotten for about half of what I paid for these   don t get me wrong   I LOVE Buffalo Wild Wings   but if I m paying that much for   hot wings   they better be the best wings I ve ever had   which they weren t      at all    My friend ordered a     Burger with Bacon   it came without the bacon   which she had to mention   it also came Bleeding   and she s ordered it medium well     My other friends  portobello mushroom burger  on the other hand  was completely over cooked  It looked like a burnt piece of cardboard   We asked her to box our leftovers   She proceeded to throw them all in ONE bag        I specifically said  can you keep the blue cheese with my wings   please   no blue cheese was in my to go box     by far the worst eating experience I ve had in Vegas   I ll be going to that burger place at the Aria next time   with the brisket bloody mary s and burgers that are worth the high prices     Todd English P U B    pfft more like   Todd English A S S,1,2013-07-17
Disappointed that the fried baloney sandwich was not made from baloney   Rather  it contained a chunky  house made mystery meat that had no similarity to baloney   If we are going to get all creative  diners deserve fair warning and accurate descriptions   Fun atmosphere ,3,2016-03-10
Delicious food  Service was a little slow  I got the lobster rolls which were not stingy on the lobster  The fries are amazing ,5,2014-07-20
Back again for work and had some free time  Decided to have a pint at Todd English P U B  Sat at the bar and learned something new  they have a   second challenge  If you drink a pint in   seconds without spilling too much you get it for free  They have sand timers welded on the bar just for that purpose    The bar tender was very accommodating and helped me chose a yummy red ale  Friendly with everyone but not intrusive    This is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to relax with a beer while in Vegas ,4,2015-03-13
Deep down  I was hoping to glimpse the model gorgeous owner  Todd English  After meeting him at his original Olives in Boston at a private function that he hosted  I still remember what a gracious host he was   even though I couldn t get past how good looking he is in person  Ok   oh yes  I was going to write a review on The Pub     Fresh fresh seafood    as soon as you walk in  you see the shrimp and oysters on ice  Raw bar heaven   Great beer selection  moderately priced and great service  Skinny and fat french fries  you have your choice  I like that   Tuna   have it a lot of ways and each way is excellent  Our table had tuna three different ways  the burger  the ahi tuna on wontons  the tuna stack  Outstanding   Very busy  This is a place where you can get in out in an hour  catch a show  blow your money at the tables and then come back again in the morning for their killer Bloody Mary   Great buzz  open kitchen  clean  Loved it  Easy to see how you could come here a couple times a day  Next time  maybe Todd will be there   or at his Olives inside Bellagio ,4,2012-11-10
We have been to PUB a couple of times now   On both occasions we have eaten and also taken on the   second beer challenge   The beer challenge is a lot of fun   you used to be able to select form any beer on the   very extensive menu   but now you are limited by price to only certain beers   and you have   seconds to down your pint   If you succeed you get the beer for free  limit of two  if not  you have to pay for it   I would recommend that you pick a less gassy beer  my favorite is Boddington s  very smooth    As for the food  we have tried   or   of the entrees  as our last visit was in a large group  and it really wasn t that great   sometimes it has been the flavors  sometimes the  secret  ingredients that aren t listed on the menu but come as garnishes on the plate   Their fries are pretty good  sweet  steak and frites  so I would say get a side of those   The food prices are a few bucks more than I think are reasonable and on any future visits I think we will stick to just some drinks and eat elsewhere   I suppose it is just our taste in food as we ate at Todd English s  Olive  in Bellagio on a previous trip and didn t much care for that either ,3,2012-10-14
Happy hour is definitely the time to go  Otherwise it s pretty typical expensive beers  As in    to     for a pint of things like Guinness or Spaten  Of course the place is attached to the Aria and City Center so I expected it to be pricey  The HH special was half price pints     sliders     oysters and    wings  I took advantage of the beer and sliders while catching a couple of afternoon March Madness games   The entrees coming out for other patrons all looked really good as well  Next time I am in Las Vegas I may make it a point to grab lunch here    I want to go     stars because I fall between A OK and I m a fan  I m certainly a fan of the happy hour deals but not having much in terms of entrees I cannot solidly give it a lot higher ,4,2012-03-20
So after Todd English Pub charged me twice for my meal       the credit is STILL not on my account as of        The server ran my card on the wrong bill  said he would void it  and reran my card with the correct amount  The charge in error is STILL there  I have called Todd English Pub EVERY day from           leaving detailed information with a manager or person answering the phone  Not ONCE have I received a call back  and my account has yet to be credited  I filed a disputed transaction claim with my credit card company to let them deal with it  Good thing I kept both receipts ,1,2011-04-01
Great Food  Wonderful service  We ate at this restaurant twice in the two days that we were there  I would highly recommend this to other visiting the Vegas area  Beer challenge is fun and a great place for lunch ,5,2016-12-29
I stopped in here for lunch during my recent Vegas trip  I decided to eat light because I was going to Morimoto for dinner  I went with a Soup and Salad Combination of Clam Chowder and a Caesar Salad   The Clam Chowder was rich and thick with lots of juicy Clams  Potatoes and other veggies  The only problem was that I felt some grittiness in a few mouthfuls  I don t know if it came from the Potatoes or the Clams  but either way  that is never pleasant  My waitress warned me that the Caesar dressing hand a lot of Anchovy  but I liked it very much  The Garlic Croutons were so good I made sure I ate them all  Even though I left quite a bit of Romaine Lettuce on the plate  it was fresh and crisp  Service was quick and friendly  My waitress even offered me an Iced Tea refill to go  The restaurant is wheelchair accessible   I normally don t factor price into my reviews  but I feel compelled to here         for a cup of soup and        for a salad with no protein seems out of line  even for Vegas ,3,2017-10-28
Pros  Great vibe  great staff  killer beer selection and a loaded bloody marry to fed off the heaviest of hangovers   Cons  Had the fish and chips which you think would be a staple at any pub  especially a Todd English pub  This is a featured selection though the fish was mushy and was unable to pick up any piece without it falling apart  The fish itself was a large halibut which depicts exactly what I was describing above  Not sure about the other items  but what I had was not a recommendation ,2,2015-10-10
Lobster rolls were too salty to eat  loaded chips were just ok  corn dog puppies  they only gave us   the rest were fries  Sliders were good  The chicken that came with the lettuce wraps was good  Over all it was far more expensive then it should have been and over rated ,2,2015-09-28
Two adjectives come to mind  expensive and forgettable    We were somewhat trapped in the City Center area  so we choose this place    Issue    if  communal  and  unisex  are not appealing concepts to you  then avoid the bathrooms at all costs  I don t even want to wash my hands in a mixed doubles setting  so the bathrooms were not to my liking   Issue    For the meals that we had  the price was quite high  My partner had the duck and hoisin buns  Not a hit  I had the lobster cocktail         nothing to write home about  I had the chilled shrimp as well  Not unlike what would be served at any other restaurant    Service was fine  not exceptional    I wouldn t return except under duress ,2,2010-10-18
Great food and great service   One of my favorite places during my stay in Vegas   Cameron was an excellent waiter and kept us coming back   I don t review restaurants very often  but this place is just too good not to share ,5,2014-12-03
We eat here at least twice whenever we are in Las Vegas   The menu is varied  something for everyone  the crab  lobster rolls  lobster cobb  chili  grilled cheese      even the huge assortments of beers is out of this world   Relaxed  pub like atmosphere   never have to wait on food  Todd English was even there one afternoon in March and stopped by our table to chat   It s hard to find   at the back of Crystals Shopping area  upper level   you can see it from reception at Aria  but cant get to it without going outside and around the building  It s certainly worth the walk ,5,2013-08-07
I have tried Fish and Chips at pretty much all the English pubs in Vegas    Even though the price was really high  I did that again   Ouch  It sucked really bad     It wasn t crispy at all  it was more like fritter  and the cod was very thin  Very greasy  I know all fried food is greasy   but in this case  the oil they use is bad  I guess   Not fresh at all  maybe frozen fish      I also ordered a pint of Guiness draught   it was like    bucks or something    super ridiculous  Wasn t taste good either  meaning it wasn t fresh     I d rather go to Irish Pub in Mandalay Bay  Food is better  price is cheaper  and Guiness draught is much better    My server was super slow and bitchy  btw    FDP ,2,2012-11-12
I loved the cheese plate  but whatever that jam thing is they have with it tastes like cigarettes  I d prefer an apricot jam or something like that  the beer cheese and pretzel was pretty good but so much salt  and the poutine was yum  long islands were pretty yummy but so expensive  i know i know  it s the strip   went during happy hour and still spent       would try again though  when I have more       if you re on a budget  you can do happy hour and it will be fine  i just really wanted the cheese plate and the long islands weren t on happy hour   ,4,2018-01-24
This place is good  They have a good menu with a good variety    My husband got fish and chips  I got chili  I would not get the chili again  it tastes like it has BBQ sauce in it  and its kind of sweet and I don t like that   The fish and chips were great  Fries come in   sizes   skinnies and fatties  We got fatties  I think I would try skinnies next time  We both got Guinness so I am not sure about the other beers    But there is a huge menu  and there are many many things you can order    Service is good  The location is good  I would come here again     They give you a little bowl of popcorn kind of like an appetizer  some if it was bleu cheese tasting and well  it was fabulous ,4,2012-01-09
Came here for happy hour on our last day in Vegas  Can t vouch for the normal food but am a big fan of the atmosphere  drinks  and  finger  food  They have    wings     oysters  and    sliders during happy hour  The wings and oysters were pretty good    oysters also came with horseradish and a delicious vinegar sauce    They have a pretty good drink menu with a huge selection of beers  The strawberry mojito is delicious   Get a pitcher for     and split it with friends  A few people at our table also got adult milkshakes which were pretty good  but apparently not as good as the regular milkshakes   Atmosphere is very casual   we were there on a football day and the entire restaurant bar got super loud  Overall a great place to hang out with friends ,4,2013-01-08
Bad service  We have five people and they just gave us a table for    Then we asked for one more chair they just kept saying  give me one second  and ignore us  My frd stood in the restaurant for ten more minutes  At last we got the chair ourselves ,1,2016-05-27
This place was pretty lame  It hooks with you with a cute Irish Pub feel  but prepare to be disappointed   We had terrible service  It took    minutes to have our beverages delivered while they sat warm at the bar  Food was about     per person  which I know is typical for Vegas  but the portions were small  Taste was average  nothing to write home about    I got a plate with beef and fritos  I can t remember what it was called  It came out very differently than I expected  One friend ordered the sliders and found them inedible  She did like her fries though    A few of my friends ordered oysters  which were a pretty good price  The entrees came  the oysters did not  so they cancelled them    It was about a      bill for lunch for    with   people ordering alcoholic drinks  Not worth it ,2,2011-05-17
Stopped in for a late nosh  Best draft beer selection we found on the strip  Ate appetizers  Fired pickles  pickles  pretzels  All good ,4,2013-04-16
Went here before a show  and i really wish we had more time here  we had like    minutes  and def rushed ourselves  as this place deserved to have more time spent in it   Ordered a few beers  popcorn comes out in a lil tin can  just eh   half isnt popped     Appetizer   I ordered the lobster poppie  and my friend ordered the duck buns   each came with    so we just split them   Both of these things were so weird and refreshing  they were great   The bun on the duck bun was a lil much  but delicious   and the lobster poppie aioli was addicting  i actually soaked up some with the duck bun   Dinner   My friend ordered a fish special  i dont remember what it was  other then that it was very good   and i got the brisket on challah bread with te bbq sauce and black truffle mayo   the sauces were delicious  and challah was  being a jew from long island  not the best  same with the brisket   if you re not like me  and not used to amazing homemade brisket and challah bread  then it was easily amazing   Worth going back to  specially for the drinks ,4,2011-05-27
great service  kinda pricey  I would say     for a burger or sandwich   But what can you say  You re on the strip   It was pretty tasty though and they dont take too long on making the food   Oh and they give free popcorn out ,4,2012-07-10
While I liked the setup and the feel of P U B   the food didn t live up to the hype   I had the roast beef sliders   I was disappointed that my foo was lukewarm at best   The fries on the other hand were served hot and were very good   In a separate experience at P U B   there was a bathroom attendant in the common hand washing area   Bathroom attendants are as useful as street side sign twirlers ,2,2012-12-31
I ve been here   times now  and tried several different menu items  Overall  this is a good place to go with some friends to have a light dinner and a couple of beers   The items I ve had  Brown Butter Lobster Rolls  Tuna Burger  Fish and Chips  Slider Sampler  deep fried oysters  and the bread pudding   The best item is the Brown Butter Lobster Rolls  These are delicious  and they don t skimp on the lobster meat   The rest of the items are just ok  standard pub fare  and quite frankly overpriced for what you get   The bread pudding had potential and some interesting ingredients but just wasn t set up when I got it after quite a long wait   One other issue I had with this place was how loud it is  I think whoever is setting the level on the music has some hearing loss  This place is not family friendly AT ALL ,3,2013-03-12
This place is incredible  The best bar food you could ask for  I have been here   times so far and everything I have tried is great  Their brunch is my favorite and the  Lobster eggs Benny  is amazing  They have a RIDICULOUS bloody Mary bar with the most incredible make your own menu I have ever seen  Their happy hour is great  with great deals on sliders and wings and beer  I could go on for a wile about this place  try it     it s a bit pricey for bar food  but you won t be disappointed ,5,2014-12-26
We had dinner here last Saturday night        and had a great time   Order the Junk Chips for an appetizer   They are the bomb   There is a huge selection of beers  of course they were out of my first choice    It was fun  busy  and had a lot of energy   It does get kind of loud in there  so if you are looking for a quiet intimate romantic place  this is not it  I am pretty sure they specialize in seafood  but do offer land lover options too  They also sell ping pong balls for beer pong    yes  they have a beer pong table     ,4,2013-05-23
We had one of the best times at Todd English PUB   Chef Jamie was attentive and informative  The food was delicious   The Chicken Parm sliders were exceptional as were the Dirty Chips   The atmosphere was fun and all the staff friendly  especially our server  Andrew   Brad the manager came by a few times to check on us and offered some great suggestions from the menu and the bar   Will be sure to return   Highly recommend ,5,2012-02-20
My favorite dining experience in four days at the Aria in Vegas    ended up there three times and my husband even more   In short  amazing food and extensive draft beer menu at a better value than anywhere in the Aria and I imagine elsewhere on the Strip    Our first meal was a Sunday brunch   At   am in late September  it was just cool enough to enjoy our meal outside  watching an NFL game on a big screen they had wheeled out   After much deliberation and consultation with the server  I had a salad and the lobster rolls   best meal of my whole trip   Just amazing   Order them  several times if you can   They were offering an impressive Bloody Mary menu    not our thing but I m sure many others would love to add smoked gouda or bacon or beef broth to their Maries   We instead ordered fancy     seasonal fest draft beers   a deceptively great deal considering the    Bud Lights everywhere else on the Strip     Second meal  dinner   After demolishing the toasted pretzel appetizer  I couldn t finish the second half of my grilled cheese panini with brie and bacon   I do consider myself a connoisseur of both soft pretzels and brie sandwiches   I can t emphasize enough how good these were    Third  meal   late afternoon happy hour   TE PUB offers a decent Happy Hour for Vegas standards  somewhat decent for DC standards      pm and   pm     half price draft beer     wings     oysters     sliders   I hated the Woodchuck Pumpkin Reserve I ordered  who can drink that nonsense    and my awesome waitress replaced it no charge   Three of us shared some wings   perfectly tender and seasoned   but in retrospect I regret not getting the soft pretzels again    Laid back ambiance  the kind of place I would love to frequent in DC  a nice break from the  chic  of the Aria and the general excess of Vegas ,5,2012-10-07
Loved it  The food was sooooo good that we are here twice  Great craft beer selection  best Bloody Mary I have had in a very long time if not ever  and Moscow mule was refreshing and full of the good stuff  The carvery of turkey inhad was juicy and tender and a deconstructed sandwich    The pickled veggies    Wow  Perfect  I saw other dishes that are for to cure a hangover and they looked amazing  Fries    Wow   More please  The pub itself is a nice atmosphere and the staff is speedy and friendly   Great for large groups and for couples  Loved it ,5,2015-11-10
Way overpriced and everything was salty  My     Bloody Mary wasn t worth     My husbands     tuna tartar was   chips with a bite of just ok tuna on each ,1,2014-07-27
F this place       We walked over to the Aria for a late night dinner with a group of    and were sent away  That is only after checking on yelp for their hours of operation and calling to be sure that they would indeed be open  I received the same response both times  Open until two  Not the case  just after       on a Saturday and they sent our party of    away  I suppose we dodged a bullet by not staying  the raw bar smelled less than fresh  It made the whole restaurant smell like a dirty fish market that never has been cleaned  which was pungent from the first moment you opened the door      This place came highly recommended and I can t see why  Even the bartender was terse ,1,2013-07-03
Just say no   At first glance  it s cute  and it tells you to come hither   So you do   I was expecting awesome food for some odd reason    mostly because I love pubs  and most of the time the experience is fun and yummy   We arrived as a group of six  and were seated within ten minutes   So far so good   The menu is fun   Half of the menu  literally  half  is their beer selection   Too bad I only like pale light crisp beers  so my choices were limited   but I still enjoyed my  Straten   from Germany   On draft draught     I was debating between the bison burger  never had  and was even contemplating subbing with regular ground beef had I gotten it    the toppings sounded good    I think it was blue cheese  celery  carrot   Now that I wrote it out  it doesn t sound that great at all   Either way  I ll never know  because I got the fish and chips   Figured   it s an English pub   get one of their specialties     My cousins got the chicken parm sliders   They actually sound good  even though it s not the thing to order anywhere that isn t Italian   But there was a problem   So let me ask you this   When you hear  chicken parm   you think breaded chicken breast  right   Not ground chicken meat with a sour marinara  right   Well  that s what this was   Ground chicken   Why   It should be named  ground chicken sliders with acidic tomato sauce    And you only get three  and I believe it s an  entree  dish   Not an appetizer   Booooo   My fish n  chips were good  but nothing that other pubs should be worried about   Two pieces of fried Cod  and the batter was good   Crispy  although a bit too thick   The fish itself was a tad overcooked and rubbery  but shake some malt vinegar on it and you re good to go   It comes with thick steak cut fries   The dipping sauces are tartar and a creamy malt vinegar   I prefer regular malt vinegar  which you have to ask for      odd for an English pub   Usually they have cruets or the Heinz version of it on the table         That s not right   Oh  but it was   Anyway  the person who wrote the menu descriptions should be paid a million billion dollars for making everything sound so good   and unique     Ambiance is cool   Beer selection is nice   Food is a definite miss   Prices are not matched properly to the quality and amount   Service is very good   The employees are very friendly and kind ,2,2010-05-25
Best burger I ve ever had   The buffalo burger  That s it   If you can say anything bad about that you have no soul basically ,5,2015-11-24
This has become a spot we always stop at when we re in Vegas  It s nice to get away from The Strip and just chill in a pub like this    the draft beer list is awesome  they truly have beers from all around the world  and we ve always had really friendly bartenders  If you re a beer drinker I definitely recommend giving this place a try ,5,2017-05-31
Definitely pub like  in a cavernous sort of way  Good Strongbow on tap is a plus  Ordered the Confit Duck Legs on Whole Wheat with Black Truffle Mayo and Todd English BBQ sauce  Also had the New England Fish   Chips  Although definitely not  pub  prices  very delicious and somewhat worth it  Lots of interesting foods on the menu to try    Very good food and fun place to hang out ,4,2010-09-15
excellent pastrami  great beer selection   Not that expensive for vegas ,5,2011-02-08
We headed here a few times while in the area for a conference  It has a very pub like feel to it and plenty of seating both at the bar and through the restaurant    Menu itself had a lot to offer and that was great cause we have a few gluten free people and one vegan was with us also  They all found something they were happy with    Only down side here was staff  The host desk seemed really uninterested in helping and despite their being three of them they just seemed interested in taking to one another than guests    Overall  A Good food and a fun   second challenge at the bar  makes for a fun time ,4,2017-01-05
We came here for HH Oysters and beer  So we didn t get a chance at the food  Oyster were okay     per Wing     Oysters and    per Slider  Not a bad deal for being in Aria and being on the strip  We got Oysters from East and West coast which was nice to have the variety  They do a   second Beer challenge  which is a pretty sweet deal  Drink any Pint of beer that is     or less on their beer menu in less than   seconds and the beer is free  Limit     You want to start the night off right in Vegas      Dozen    Oysters and   Beers each chugged in less than   seconds makes for a really good cheap start to a night in Vegas   Oh  and I m a Popcorn Freak  Free popcorn at your table  And they have the tables with built in Taps   Decent Spot  check it out  If anything  stop in for your free   second beer ,3,2013-06-20
Over all I enjoyed myself here  The food is good  the service is good and the ambiance is good  No complaints and for that  it gets   stars considering how picky I am  It also helps that they have an amazing beer menu  Over all great experience  Check it out over ANY pub you re thinking of going to  trust me ,5,2015-10-23
One of the best happy hours around   Oysters and beers on sale are always a plus  Yup I ll be back ,4,2015-02-06
Even better than last time   no wait  we came in for lunch and were seated right away  complimentary popcorn was served shortly after we were seated    Do not miss these items Lobster Roll   generous sandwiches each stuffed with claw meat with aioli and thick toasted brioche bread   The bread itself is amazing Swordfish enchilada  cooked to perfection  flaky yet firm meat served inside a tortilla with beans  sourcream and tortilla chips   I was alternating between bites of lobster and enchilada because i coundn t make up my mind what tasted better Salad with rotisserie chicken we expected some slices of chicken and practically had half of a rostisserie chicken on our palte that was extremly moist  delicious and well seasoned    no room for dessert but I will definately be back for the dirty chips  ,4,2011-01-24
This place is tons of fun   I stopped in with my family to have oysters and beer and we ended up eating and drinking for a couple of hours    Great ambiance  friendly service and good food ,4,2013-02-19
The staff was so flexible with our group of     offered great recommendations for food and drink  and it was delicious  I highly recommend the pickle chips  ,5,2017-07-31
We got to the restaurant around   pm on a Thursday night          and were seated promptly  There is apparently a different hostess for indoor seating vs outdoor seating  Note that the outdoor eating area is not gated  so every once in awhile  an obnoxious passerby will walk through the dining area   FOOD  Hand chopped ahi tuna burger  served rare and comes with wonton chips and some kind of wasabi or dijon dip  I ordered the avocado on the side since I m allergic  OMG  This was sooooooooo good  Although they spread the wasabi aioli on a bit unevenly and I teared up on some bites into my burger  it didn t distract me from the amazing taste and texture of this unique burger  There is a layer of black bean puree that brought everything together  The buns were lightly toasted and the arugula marinated to complement everything else   Brown butter lobster rolls   came with kettle chips and coleslaw  We split our entrees so I got a whole lobster roll to myself  it comes with three   My goodness  this was one buttery and rich lobster roll  The browned butter is such a genius idea  The lobster pieces were generous and not heavily saturated in mayo  I love how they kept the chunks of lobster big instead of dicing them smaller to make a filler out of mayo  It really kept things fresh and gave me nice chewing action  I tasted the coleslaw and it was pretty good  My mom is not fond of coleslaw  but she polished it off  The chips were just kettle chips  nice crunch  not overly salted   SERVICE  Service was okay  It s what I expected for a bar pub type restaurant  Nothing great  nothing bad  I don t like servers to check up on us too often  I don t think she checked up on us at all which can be an issue if I needed something  but didn t   Definitely try out their tuna burger since this type of burger is rarely on the menu at other restaurants   It s hard to choose between the two entrees we ordered though  so either order both for yourself and take half home or bring someone to share with   Although there are a lot of homeless people there  so you can always order both for yourself and give the remainder to someone who needs it ,5,2014-05-16
Happy Hour is a tradition that dates back to the     s in the Navy when sailors would enjoy a few drinks while viewing boxing and wrestling on board at the same era when speakeasies would hold a cocktail hour  Nearly a century later I would share in this tradition on the famous Las Vegas Strip in Todd English Pubb     From   to   PM and    to Midnight  Todd English P U B   holds a Happy Hour  Pints of beer and glasses of wine are half priced  Wings are     And oysters are     In my opinion  the appetizer Happy Hour specials are a bit misleading  A    for seven chicken wings will come up to     Not a bargain at all     In this fast paced world that I live in  I partake in Happy Hour to be happy  Todd English P U B   features a major selection of beers to choose from to be happy  The categories include craft beers  fruity beers  the big boys  and so on  I usually get one to three beers  When I entered this thriving restaurant and pub located between Crystals and the Aria all uptight and exhausted from work  I make a beeline to the center bar  By the time I drink the pint of Fruli strawberry for example  I am becoming happy  After the pint of Arrogant Bastard Ale I am happy  And once I cash in my Yelp free check in offer for a free Bud Light and drink it  I am OFF THE CHARTS HAPPY     The reality is that Todd English P U B   is an upbeat establishment that feeds off all the positive energy on the Las Vegas Strip  The majority of the patrons are tourists without a care in the world but to have a good time  After an Arrogant Bastard Ale and Bud Light  I kind of develop this tourist state of mind  I feel like I am part of a big party  Every so often in this party  the bar tender will ring a bell  This is to call attention to the fact that somebody is getting a complimentary drink for quaffing a beer down within seven seconds  Maybe one day after a stressed out shift I could write a review update on drinking a beer in less than seven seconds     Being in City Center  Todd English P U B  fills up fast  This will cause some delay in the partaking of Happy Hour when all the bar stools are taken and the bar tenders are busy      At Todd English P U B   it is more than the names of some of the beers that are weird  What is kind of weird  or just so out of the ordinary in Vegas is that men and women share the same sinks  If you are going on a date and plan to freshen up  I would advise another restroom       Happy Hour is a tradition that I am so going to continue to partake in  And I am happy to say that when I am in City Center with the urge for a cold one or two between   and   PM  that the odds are in my favor of partaking in another Todd English P U B   Happy Hour      The Daniel  S      Yelp     Challenge   Review     ,4,2013-07-24
Enjoyed both meals I had here during recent visit to Vegas  Plenty of draught beer  PUB food with a twist  and awesome service  Highly recommend to those of you who love PUBs  but want something a bit more classy than your usual local dive  Of course you ll pay more   It s in Aria which is the newest hotel on the strip   But  if you can drain beers in   seconds then you get  em for free ,5,2010-06-26
Todd English P U B   like most Vegas Strip eating establishments is totally overpriced for what you get  but  whatever  you re on vacation  live it up  The fish and chips were excellent and huge portions  I wish I had requested skinny french fries instead of the wedges that it comes with  because it was a bit much  The reviewer who posted a photo of his fish and chips had a very different experience than I and my dinner companions did  We easily had twice as much food on our plates  The lobster rolls was AMAZING and something I still dream about    They went the deliciously decadent butter method versus the gross mayonnaise method which I full support  Also  a huge selection of beers  The decor  had a bit too much of an  American Pickers  theme going on  but it was still pleasant ,4,2013-01-09
I like the food and beer selection here a LOT  Some of the food is overpriced  but if you make happy hour there are some decent deals  We actually went twice in our four day trip  The fried pickles and homemade pickled vegetables were great  and the sliders were pretty good  The beer selection is out of this world   hard to find selections like that  honestly    However  the service was really pretty bad  It was inattentive  having us sitting with empty glasses in front of us for    minutes or more  and it was inefficient  causing us to ask for something two or three times before it arrived  We sat in the same booth both nights and had two different servers  and one was better than the other  but not by a lot  The first night was happy hour and they were pretty busy  so that might be something of an excuse  although not really   staff for the business you have   but the second night was later and the restaurant was only about     full ,4,2017-01-23
Good food  fun and fast bartenders  We sat at the bar  I think it was much better than if we sat at a table  The oysters were delicious we did a mixed plate of half east coast and half west  Very fresh tasting  I enjoyed the potstickers very much  but my husband thought they were just ok  We split the ribeye  It was cooked perfectly  If you are up to the challenge flip the hourglass and down a beer in seven seconds to get it for free  Hubby completed the challenge  I took a pass     Don t underestimate the desert  The brownie ala mode was one of the yummiest things I ever have had in my mouth lol ,4,2014-01-06
I am a huge fan of their wings   They are the full wing  our waiter described it as  double jointed  which comprises of the   pieces of hot wings that we are used to  which isn t something you normally see   Happy hour makes the prices even more worthwhile as the bill can rack up fairly quick     A few months ago I came here with a few friends and played beer pong  it s not as convenient here as it may seem as the ping pong balls will be disruptive to the other diners     Can t wait to come back next time ,5,2015-10-03
Do you enjoy being ignored   By nearly very employee   Standing at the door having numerous employees look through you as they saunter by to lean against the bar to have a chat with the bartender   Finally having to ask someone about seating and being told  before    pm on a Saturday night  that the kitchen is closed   Me neither   So this isn t a review on their food  it s a review on the utter disdain their employees have for their customers  or in this case  a never was  never will be customer   My husband grew up in Vegas  we ve been back here frequently to visit family and have eaten at a number of restaurants in every category from hole in the wall to   star Michelin and I can say with utmost certainty it was the worst experience I ve ever had   Meh   With such limited late night dining in the deserted Crystals  I imagine PUB will go the way of Beso in five  four  three     ,1,2012-12-24
Ate here last Wednesday afternoon the food was good but later my Mom told me that her sliders tasted like they had been sitting out for awhile  I admonished her for not saying anything but she just shrugged  Definitely the type of place to come with friends and order a bunch of stuff to tackle together  We didn t even attempt the lengthy drink menu as we had just come from the spa ,3,2013-12-05
I think Todd English is an extremely accomplished chef  but this restaurant doesn t seem to have any reflection of that   I m giving three stars  but even feel that may be excessive   Went at happy hour and tried chicken wings and chicken parm sliders  Chicken wings were fine  Chicken parm sliders were    acceptable  Skinny fries really remind me of Burger King  Oops  Sorry   Beer and wine are half priced  but no cocktail specials      mediocre drinks   I guess catering to the extreme broad population necessitates the dumbing down of the food ,3,2016-07-01
BEST BLOODY MARY EVER       The only reason we came here and we were not disappointed  This one was the Something About Mary  Slider  chicken wing  corn dog bite  cheese etc etc etc  So yummy,5,2014-05-04
Not too crowded but FN noisy  Stadium style and booths and table seating with compulsory sticky elbows from soiled tables  Servers were nice but there was a turn and burn feeling  Pseudo pub food was adequately expensive for average quality fare of what was intended by namesake chef Todd English  I think you should need be drunk first  Beverage selection was featured but no real focus  Not an English Pub  not a local bar  Was expecting more local brews  but all they had was one  the others were vague or out  Black Tan was      Either the server was confused or untrained  Unless you have a large group  are inebriated or are desperate for food  spend    elsewhere ,3,2013-07-27
We were waiting for our room to be available for check in at the Aria and  decided to grab lunch to pass the time  The Todd English Pub was the first restaurant we came across as we exited the Aria so we decided to give it a try  In hindsight  I wish we d done a bit more research and kept looking    I know we re in Vegas and prices are ridiculously jacked up but a      lunch for two people is insane  There was nothing special enough about this food to warrant such a high price tag  I ordered the Prime Rotisserie sandwich  which was basically a fancy name for French dip  For      it shockingly came with a side of fries too  I debated for quite awhile whether I should order a     sandwich  as it basically goes against everything I believe  but everything else on the menu was similarly overpriced  The sandwich tasted fine but it was too much for me to eat in one meal  It s too bad that they don t offer half sandwich offers  especially considering that most people are on vacation and likely don t have a place to store leftovers  Instead  I had to toss part of my expensive sandwich away   My boyfriend chose the Caesar salad  which even without meat still costs     and is at least an additional    depending on the type of meat you want to add  He then also added an order of waffle fries for an extra     For a side of fries     Honestly  I wish we would have just ordered the waffle fries and called it a day  The fries were delicious albeit in no way worth    but at least it would have made our lunch less pricey overall   The ranch here is way too dilly and definitely does not taste like regular ranch  I was quite disappointed in it and I m a huge restaurant ranch fan   To get the weekend started  my boyfriend also ordered a beer  Guess how much that cost      for one beer  As is the theme of this review  that s crazy  In fact  it was so crazy that he only ordered the one beer and I m not sure when is the last time I ve seen him stick to one beer at a restaurant    I d be willing to offer four stars for the food if the prices weren t so high but the quality just doesn t match the price tag as is  Although the complimentary popcorn was a nice touch  it wasn t worth     ,3,2016-04-26
The Brown Butter Lobster Rolls were insane  My dish surpassed expectations and absolutely DELIVERED   The venue is great as well  It s a large space set in a classic pub environment with a bit of a luxurious spin on it courtesy of being located at The Aria   If you re in Vegas you should check this place out ,5,2013-08-12
My service was excellent from start to finish  My hostess was pleasant  my busser was even better  but my waiter really took the cake  I think his name was Jeff    He was very attentive  I never had to wait for water  we were checked on just enough  not to much where you re bothered  very descriptive of the menu for both food and drinks  He was an excellent waiter and him and my busser made the whole experience worth it   The food was the reason for the three stars  I know it s suppose to be a pub  but I expected more out of a Tom English establishment  Their buffalo lettuce wraps were superb  but not enough meat to go in the lettuce wraps  we could only eat   lettuce wraps and they were barely stuffed with anything  Once we got out entree s I was not too impressed  We got the  I can t pronounce or spell this  fancy grilled cheese and the chicken parm sliders  The grilled cheese had way to much bread  and not enough fillings inside  The chicken parm was ok  but the worst variation I have had of chicken parm yet  All in all  I would go back  just to try different menu items and see if my opinion changes  Def go during happy hour and grab the half off pitchers  They have a fabulous beer selection ,3,2015-08-18
Went two days in a row  Had the bus and flight special and the next day the buffalo burger  Both were very good,4,2013-07-31
My girlfriend and I went to this pub while we were staying at Aria because it was close and the dealers at the casino said it was good     The beer selection is amazing   We had a flight each and then settled on a local vegas beer  tenaya creek  i think    The bartenders were fun and attentive  getting me to take part in the  beat the clock  game a couple of times   thats something new that i ve never seen in any other bar but should be more popular     We ate  at the bartender s recommendation  the chips with blue cheese and chicken livers   LOVED IT     We ll definitely be back next time we re in Vegas  this place rocks ,4,2010-07-08
This place specializes in beer and bar foods   I had lobster rolls   They are average tasting   I would not come back here for the foods  Had better lobster rolls at Lobster Me at the Venetian  The foods are a little overpriced ,3,2016-09-05
I had a little lunch here while waiting for my room at the Aria  The atmosphere is nice  but the service was lacking  When you spend     for a beverage and charcuterie plate  you should not have to hunt down your server  The food was not bad  but I did observe two other tables sending food back due to  off  taste and completely wrong order ,3,2015-03-31
Breath taking rudeness from the brunette host upon arrival  Embarrassing to show American hospitality at its worst to my International guests  Walked away and went to the excellent Spanish Tapas place next door ,1,2013-09-27
Alright so classy I know  but we had the corn dog puppies and lobster roll     Both were really good  Drinks were good  Decent happy hour deals also  The bartenders were great  I really enjoyed the music though   I heard Korn  Alice in Chains  and Metallica while I say at the bar  There aren t many places that I ve been to where I could say that     made me want to stay longer,4,2014-08-08
Stopped here for a late dinner  huge beer selection  any type of brew seemed to be available  Ordered the mussels and the tuna burger  both were great  nicely done and tasty ,4,2012-08-03
Stayed at the Aria  so I was pretty excited upon realizing  that this was adjacent to the front lobby  The selection was outstanding  lots of Belgian imports  as well as quality stuff from around the good old US of A  For an Eastcoaster such as myself  this was a great opportunity to get stuff like Black Butte on draft  For those visiting without renting a vehicle  this would also be a good opportunity to get their craft drink on right on the strip  unless they want to be sipping sugary drinkie poos from over sized plastic sippy cups  The ambiance is also superior to most L  Vegas bars  The lighting was very cozy  the bar was an oval in the center of the room  with multiple bartenders tending to ones needs  A game of sports was being televised on television sets placed all around the joint  Now for the prices  most stuff was in the neighborhood of         I understand that for Las Vegas this is a very niche business  though one on the rise  and the rent must be higher than Charlie Sheen  but other places we visited were able to offer somewhat lower prices  Not being huge gamblers  what me and my wife did was play some slots at Aria  than upon winning          we would proceed to this P U B  and blow our winnings  Repeat as many times as necessary   Note for guests staying at Aria  the in room fridges have weight sensors  I did what I do everywhere else in the world  take the contents out neatly  place own purchases gallon of water  as we re in the dessert  beers   and before checking out  place everything back in in the same order  We received a bill of around     for mini fridge charges  They said they would investigate  but it took us many calls to the managers to get this fee reversed   lesson learned  don t every do anything  anywhere lol,5,2012-04-22
The best ever roast beef sandwich    Not only just roast beef but  prime  roast beef   Meat sliced so thin that it s like butter    Damnn good and for      it better be   Comes with a     of prime beef  slices of bread of your choice and different sauces   One being  the black truffle mayo which is awsome   Great dipping with wedge cut fries with sea salt   Other than that  the rest of the menu looked really good but the sandwich was enough to put me to sleep    Nice spot located in the Aria Hotel   A lot of beer choices but for a higher end pub  I d expect better and harder to find beers and ales like the ones in LA bars ,4,2010-07-28
Good restaurant  Great meat choices  Service was a little slow  especially when the restaruant wasn t even half full  We had a good time though  Good atmosphere  Good value ,3,2011-03-16
Good drink selection and service   The a prime Rib Chili was good  not great   If it were chunky style   with someway to tell he meat was actually prime rib  it old have been better   Campbell s Chunky Steak chili is as good  if ot better  Overall  a good experience ,4,2013-01-18
Great food and large drink list   The portions are quite large and one entree could easily be split for two people   I recommend the mussels with bread and my friend said her bloody mary was one of the best she s ever had ,4,2011-09-19
Seem to end up   this place w out of towers if they re staying on this end of the strip   The best part of my last visit  which was dinner last week  was the server  He was hilarious and also attentive w out being annoying  The food is okay but expensive for what it is was  had the duck buns which were prob the best of what we ordered  Spinach salad was average and the junk fries just did not jive with whatever they put on them  I think they have taken whatever leftovers they had on deck and threw them on    Good casual pub like bar area if you re having a few drinks  The dining area was extremely loud  The combination of Def Leppard and the woman who  didn t know when to stop screaming her day s story with her large table didn t put exactly put me in the mood for relaxation while eating ,3,2015-01-17
Had a     GC from our hotel reservation website that was good for redemption at any store or restaurant at the Crystals center  Sooo we walked through debated between Mastro s  Beso  and Todd English  Glad we chose this place because it s probably the most laid back of all the choices  With Louis Vuoitton  Prada   Gucci stores within walking distance  this place was eerily normal  Wait staff friendly  set up table for six with no wait  dining room was pretty full  We ordered appetizers  onion rings  plate of like six HUGE seriously the size of a grown mans hand  and pot stickers  Both were reeeeally good  Two of us had the ribeye  they liked it  The rest of us had burgers  the Pub Burger is excellent  Fatty fries awesome  The chicken blt looked really good  but he didn t like the skinny fries they re infused with some sort of blue cheese seasoning  And the other person didn t care for her buffalo burger because it was drowning in blue cheese  Overall  really good ,4,2011-11-28
              REVIEW                       I didn t eat  came here to meet up with some friends  they were here for a bachelor party    they were watching the game  so we met up for some beer   Yeah right  i don t drink beer haha   Nice decor  love the marbled tables  wooden bar  nice vibe for a fancy pub  not quite sure it s really an English pub  Union Jack flags are all over the place  so I know I m in the right pub       for a pint of beer  They offer quite an array of    choices  The guys drank started with a nice pint Guinness and Bass with a cheese plate then  they also tried out some Welsh Rarebit  briskets  turkeys  all were under        of course the seafood raw bar look amazing    I only got a bite on the briskets   the rabbit   they were good  I couldn t eat because my best friend   I got dinner lining up  Oh well  next time   Nice patio outdoor too with a view of the sculpture   water piece of the Aria Hotel ,4,2010-09-21
Todd English PUB has rich hearty pub food  I love the decor and the windows that open into Aria  We had the chicken pot pie and fish and chips  Both were great  The potpie had a film crust and very rich filling  heavy cream probably   Our waitress was attentive and helpful    The only complaint I have is the hostess service  When I arrived I was looking into the restaurant for the rest of my party and they did not offer to help or see if they were there  I ended up waiting outside and then calling my party to find they were already seated  This one of my biggest pet peeves with restaurants  Your first impression when you walk into the restaurants sets the tone for the entire meal  If your hostess service is good  you probably will overlook flubs throughout the meal ,3,2012-02-18
i  went  to the Todd English P U B thinking it would be great and it started  that  way and  then the food came i had a grilled cheese with brie and bacon it was kida good  my brother had a chili dog it was not so good and  my mom got  the lobster rolls  they were also  disappointing and so were the desserts but the atmosphere was great and the service was good but i don t think i will be eating here  again ,2,2010-08-15
Really     for a pint of PBR and    for a bottle of Miller lite  That right there should be warning on how overpriced the beers are at this joint  I get that it s located in the luxurious Aria hotel but charging almost triple the price on cheap american beer is insane  Hell I cant get a Belgium Delerium Tremens for    at most places  why is it     here  It s almost cheaper to play     at a     Video Poker machine and get two comp beers ,2,2011-12-21
Awesome pub  Very cool feel and decor inside the restaurant  Didn t get to look outside  The pickle fries were good with minimal breading  They came with three sauces  and the chipotle sauce was very good  The prime rib sandwich was amazing with the French dip and onions  The prices were typical for Vegas  although not insane  A better deal than what you can get at the surrounding restaurants  The Todd English P U B  is a great lunch choice  especially for those who like beer ,4,2014-12-31
What a disappointment   I was really hoping for a great experience  Possibly the apathetic staff is to blame  however it was really sad   We sat at the bar  for a late Sunday lunch  Looking at the fun impressive beer menu  I wish I would have been told about the flights of beer  but no matter   Looking over the menu  the roasted meat selection and bread for sandwiches seemed to be a fun lunch  coupled with an order of skinny and fat fries  and we were off   Weirdly  chicken on the bone  that was covered in a sweet sauce came out with two pieces of bread  and two very mediocre sauces  BBQ and Miso Soy   My husband had the brisket on a hoagie roll  which was fine  not anything great but decent  Our french fries didn t come out  and when we told the bartender she acted as if she didn t know why they weren t out  instead of just saying she forgot to order them   which was evident later on our bill   After    minutes  my cold skinny fries and husbands fat fries came out hot  Surprisingly at the end of the whole ordeal  we were presented with a check for    dollars  without the french fries on the ticket  Ok  fine  I guess the whole thing was just a mediocre lunch  and maybe try again another time   Surprisingly after we flagged the bartender down to let us pay  we were given our credit card receipt back WITH the fries added after    AMAZING  It is just another example of a restaurant with no love in the food  a staff who doesn t really care about what they are doing  food that isn t spectacular and its a shame   I wish I was reporting better news  and I hope that locals and tourists start demanding more from these hotels than just celebrity chefs with restaurants that are sub par ,1,2010-06-28
FOOD We go for the Happy Hour and every time we go it is delicious  Oysters are always fresh  the meat in the sliders is divine and the wings always have the best buffalo sauce on them      My man and I always say we need to actually get meals there but we love the Happy Hour so much we haven t yet  THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE ABOUT HAPPY HOUR IS THIS   OVER THE PAST YEAR THEY HAVE CHANGED PRICES  TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE  AND ALSO CHANGED TYPE OF WINGS ON HAPPY HOUR TO A SMALLER STYLE    DRINKS They are known for their beers and they have a great selection  Every time we go we try something different  They also have drinks on Happy Hour  The best drink special they have going all the time is the   second challenge  Finish your beer in seven seconds and it s free       SERVICE We always sit at the bar and the service has been good every time  They do get very busy so the wait is a little longer at times but that is expected at any great restaurant  Bartenders are knowledgeable about beers so if you have questions don t be afraid to ask   PARKING It s at the casino  parking is still free here so take advantage of it before they starts charging too       ATMOSPHERE This place is always clean and very bright  Nice big open space with large bar  Outside seating is available    DEALS Happy Hours and   second beer challenge  ,5,2017-07-17
Definitely a fun place when you re hungover and need a place to get you ready for round   or       They have a bloody mary that is served with a mini slider    super delicious   The slider is perfect  They also have a tasty mini pastrami which is equally great  The fires are right on    Its fun   Its easy   Its tasty ,4,2014-03-03
Had a great time at TE PUB    Yelp has this listed as     and I don t know that I agree with that   Prices seemed a little higher to me   I had a group of four    I had the fish   Chips  the husband had the Chicken wings and my friends shared a fish and chips order   We also started with the pretzels   First  the pretzels effing rocked   SO freaking good and came with cheese sauce for dipping    Then the fish and chips were delish   I found it weird that the cole slaw was full of peas  but it was tasty when the peas were pushed out of the dish   The fish and chips  including the dip ping sauces ROCKED    My husband s wings were good   The best part was our server was fab   He had it all down and we dug the service   I think the only thing that was king of a bummer was this place is pricey   I mean  really      for ONE bottle of Stone IPA      So not cool   But  got a free Bud Light for checking in on Yelp    my husband drank it   Wondered who would take that bullet   Oh  but LOVED my drink   Think it was called barreled mule    a whiskey Mule   YES   And  it is VERY loud here   VERY LOUD ,3,2014-09-05
Ate here for a late late dinner after an exhausting    hours of Vegas  The food was delicious  We ordered off of their carvery portion of their menu  Prime rib and brisket  Both a WOW  I will definitely be going back    The atmosphere was really laid back  then again we did eat there around   pm    Can t comment on any of the beer though it looked like they had a large selection  Next time,4,2012-07-11
The food here was sooo good   We had the lobster rolls  the bread was crispy and buttery and the lobster was tender  We also had the prime rib sandwich    amazing  I had the fish and chips  they were crispy and light  My father loved the clam chowder and my brother said the tacos were really good  Definitely would go back ,4,2016-09-17
I want to start out by saying we have been here several times and always enjoyed it    Our most recent trip here was for their happy hour where you can get a beer for a decent price  if it s not happy hour beers run between    and    dollars for a pint and I find that rather high even for Las Vegas   They do serve free peanuts in the shell but come on man   The happy hour menu is good with oysters at    and wings at    each and the wings are huge   We use to like the    sliders but last night they just weren t worth writing about   The other thing about last night was the bartender on his cell phone annoyed me to pieces   He would go over to his cell phone and be on it for like   minutes reading and texting REALLY    If I owned a business cell phones would be put in a locker some where and pick it up after your shift   I know some people would say oh I have children or whatever but back in the day you found a way to communicate without the cell phone and my kids did survive   The bad part was the bartender was actually a good bartender but that cell phone just ruined it   I m not sure we will run back here I think we have moved on to some new places ,3,2016-09-13
My gfs and I were in Vegas for one of my friend s birthday weekend and we decided to have lunch here   We all ordered different things and shared it with everyone  I highly recommend to try their carvery  My friend ordered the BRISKET and it was so good  It just melted in your mouth   I ordered the SKIRT STEAK which was good all though I wish it wasn t served on a baguette   the waitress did mention that to me   Anyway  the food was DELISH  the service was excellent  I will definitely try more stuff in their carvery   Oops  Don t forget to order Sweet Potato Fries  They were yummy ,4,2011-10-15
The food is so mediocre in every way  The beer list and Eleanor are above average ,3,2013-06-08
happy hour   fab   oysters   yum  fries   awesome buffalo wings   good,5,2013-07-31
Are there words to describe the glory that is Todd English s PUB   Not sure  although I ll try as I immediately start drooling   The PUB was so faboo  that my friend and I went through within a seven hour period for first and second dinner   First dinner was comprised of lobster rolls on a brioche bun  a swapped roast beef slider  a side  more like a SIDE because there were at least six pieces   and a beer flight   My lobster rolls  heaven on a roll  also came with homemade slaw and kettle chips   It goes without saying that the food was delicious and beautiful   I had the fruit beer flight  and preferred the stawberry lambic and raspberry beer   Second dinner was a kobe beef hot dog with a chocolate strawberry beer  chocolate stout and strawberry lambic mixed together  while my friend had cheese fries and corn dog fritters   SO good   Additional nice touches  it s a great interior with a menu peppered with fun quotes along with a fancy bathroom with an attendant who squirts soap in your hands and gives you your paper towels   Giving my hard earned money to Todd felt fine  and was one of the better ways i spent my money in Vegas   I highly recommend  and am confident you ll have a delicious time   Enjoy ,5,2010-12-24
Stopped in this afternoon to try the   second challenge  We totally failed  but the bar staff was awesome and engaging  and great with food and beverage suggestions  Beer is good  shepherds pie is great  and the couple den the bar from us ordered the most amazing looking bloody Mary s  we will definitely be stopping in here at least once more on our trip ,5,2017-03-10
I have only been here to have a couple of beers   Good atmosphere and knowledgeable bartenders   I was happy to enjoy a St  Bernardus on draft   Very solid beer selection   I would go there again ,3,2015-02-13
I have been here a couple of times on different visits to Vegas and both times I left well satisfied but not necessarily wowed  On both occasions hubby and I ordered the pickled vegetables which are really delicious though with their strong flavor they can be a bit much  I recommend ordering them with a group  Last time we got something from  the carvery  which is also a good option for sharing  Our last visit we were there too late for a big meal so we just stuck to appetizers and drinks  In addition to the pickles we got some wings and the corn dog bites  Both were pretty tasty   Of course being a pub most people come to Todd English s to drink and that is where they really shine  Their list of craft beers is stellar  I really like the fact that they have a description of each one on the menu  That makes me more confident to try new ones  However  that also seems to be a crutch for the staff since our server was not familiar with them at all  We actually had to point at the ones we wanted while he wrote them down  Other than that he was pretty good but not overly friendly  We were there during March madness so there was a lively crowd clustered around the tv but the rest of the place was pretty mellow  I think this would be a good option for some late night drinks since they have a reverse happy hour from   pm to midnight  yes  that is late for me  and a lot of bars and even restaurants on the strip get way too clubby for my taste at that hour   Overall this place is a Vegas style  i e  cheesy knockoff but still cool in its own way  approximation of a British pub and even though the food does not impress  it is decent  One of the cheaper options in City Center for lunch or dinner  A better choice for hanging out over drinks with friends ,3,2013-04-14
we went to the aria for a vegas getaway and while waiting a long time to get our room  we decided to get some lunch at PUB   we opted to be seated outside but the interior looked a good place to catch a game   given how not busy it was outside  we waited for a while for a server   once he did come by he was pretty helpful   the menu is quite big so having some help was nice   we ended up just getting two dishes and one side   she got the chicken parm sliders and i got the brisket from the carvery   the sliders were tasty but a bit on the dry side   my brisket was cooked very nicely but was a tad under seasoned   i got it on a challah bread with black truffle mayo and it helped the overall flavor   we got asparagus for sides and they were nice   overall  a nice place to grab a drink and decent bar food but nothing incredible ,3,2011-01-06
One of the best burgers I ve had in a long time  I had a single patty burger  rare with cheddar and the fat fries  It was pretty much perfect  Great beef flavor  perfectly seasoned and  cooked   Excellent bun  toasted  warm  it held up to the last bite  Cheese was melted and thick enough to notice  I m not a fan of wedge cut fries   they never come out right and when they showed up I was very skeptical   These were perfect  crispy outside  soft inside  not dry or mealy at all   right amount of salt   more like roasted potatoes you d want alongside a sunday roast  Service was great  waitress was friendly  professional  totally cool   Fantastic burger  big order of fries  stuffed and happy for a bit over      Five stars is based on one visit and one burger  but Im looking forward to trying more of their food ,5,2011-10-13
The only reason they get   stars is     they make a killer Bloody Mary     The   second pint  Drink a Beer in   seconds it s free  With that said  Prices are ridiculous     for a Bud Light  Really   Small cup of mini corn dogs       Our group spent over      Sunday and the service was terrible   High prices can be over looked with good service but we were like invisable as well as server kept forgetting ,2,2014-10-06
The Lobster Rolls are to die for  Every time we got to Vegas  we make a point of dining here for brunch  lunch  or dinner  We have yet to find a restaurant that can top the lobster rolls at this place ,5,2014-10-09
I love this place but there is one Bartender that odd  I think his name is Mark  Anyway he can cock block with the best of them  Watch out boys is your looking for a date ,4,2012-10-28
Loved the Dirty chips appetizer  But they got rid of them and have a new variation on the menu  The bartender told me they could still make it  so I ordered them   not the same  they didn t have chicken livers   which I don t particularly like  but quickly found out  their flavor is important to the dish as a whole  Then the bacon was missing and they had some other stuff in them that wasn t there in the original dish  My fault for trying to force it  so I m sad to say  the OG Dirty Chips are no more and you shouldn t try to get them to make it    The location is perfect  easy to get to from both directions on the Strip   I ve eaten here probably   times and never been overly excited about any of the main dishes  They are all marginal to good  but nothing overly exciting  It s a shame    Great beer selection and a pretty good scotch selection as well  They have a half priced happy hour from        which is nice   Their Captain Crunch bread pudding is one of the best deserts in the world    So  my suggestion  go elsewhere for dinner and hit TE for drinks and sugary finish ,3,2013-03-11
Decided to try this place out after a couple times of walking past it to go to Aria s Casino  It was a Saturday so I some what expected slow service  but it was really slow  Our waiter seemed to forget about us after ordering our fried pickle appetizer when we had told him we just needed a minute to look at the drink menu  The fried pickles we ordered were just average  and we also ordered kobe beef sliders that were okay  Our waiter asked what type of cheese we wanted on the burgers to then see on the bill a    charge for the cheese  Not very good customer service to act like it was included and not tell us about the up charge  Prices were above average and the food did not delivery  Probably won t give this place a second try ,3,2014-11-23
The Happy Hour isn t quite as happy now   They took a lot of my favorite drafts off of the HH menu ,4,2017-07-22
The drink of the day on the Las Vegas strip was defiantly my mega Bloody Mary I ate   drank at The Todd English PUB connected to The ARIA Hotel   Casino    Well  this establishment is an old school looking English pub with some exquisite food  The hidden gem is the weekend   IT S ALL ABOUT MARY  signature Bloody Mary  The spicy morning pick me up cocktail provided  Frank pep in his your step after a night out of partying in SIN CITY  The special SINFUL BLEND of Mary mix with top shelf vodka is very spicy affair but a powerful morning neutralizer that not only cured my hangover but filled my belly  This amazing cocktail is not only filled with plenty of vodka but stuffed with a mountain of snacks consisting of a chicken wing  grilled prawn  olives  pickled asparagus  mini corndog    celery sticks and mini cheeseburger  This drink is truly experience  but with a     price tag it should be    As for my lunch I shared Prime rib dip and cast iron plate of brisket chili smoothed in Cheese   onions  The chili was exceptional with plenty of beans and meat all through the skillet  A worthy treat for chili lovers looking for something with a beer     I m very excited to return and expand on my culinary collection and booze consumption  But if your in Vegas and reading this I suggest coming over and finding out how amazing the Bloody Mary and food is ,5,2016-11-07
Worse food and service  We both ordered the open egg sandwich and it was cold and very salty  We sent it back  A few minutes later  the waitress brought the check and we said we sent our food back since it was very bad  New plates came out and it was slightly better  but the cheese was rubbery and still salty  I took a few bites and stopped eating  The waitress never checked on us  The table next to us noticed we sent our food back and they commented to us that their meal was cold with rubbery cheese also ,1,2016-02-22
Went to check out Aria today for the first time  was looking for a place to eat lunch and happened upon The Pub   The menu wasn t too extensive  and was hard to decide what to order   The waitress recommended some specials  one of which was the Clam Linguini       What a great choice   The clams were in their  opened shells  and the sauce was the best Ive ever had in a clam linguini   Strong taste of clams  white wine  and garlic throughout the sauce  We told the manager he needs to get this on the regular menu and he said he would pass that along and try to get it done   A great dining experience ,4,2010-07-09
make it in for happy hour      off all beer pints    sliders  great service  super cute semi hidden location    not a big lobster fan but  most of my party ordered the Lobster Roll and said it was to die for  two people claimed it was the best they ve ever had  even in comparison to ones in SF  Santa Monica  and Seattle   the sliders were medium rare and melted in your mouth   get the skinny fries not the wedge ones   def will be back  ,4,2015-11-19
   Todd English PUB offers many entrees that are not that expensive when compared to other celebrity chef backed Vegas restaurants  but the food was mediocre  I will probably seek out Todd English s Olives  The Bellagio  instead on my next Vegas trip     We were in Las Vegas and were looking for a decent but still reasonably priced dinner spot so we decided to head to Todd English PUB   I was impressed with Todd English s food at the LA Food   Wine Festival and had high hopes for this one  even though I knew that Todd English PUB was going to be much more casual and simple fare    The atmosphere was very raucous   It very much had a gastropub feel and it was quite loud   There was also a seating area outside with heat lamps  unfortunately  since Todd English PUB is located in a congested area  you have to deal with several smokers nearby    The menu consisted of a wide variety of food from several fried appetizers to burgers and sandwiches as well as some English pub grub like fish and chips and bangers and mash   We started with the ahi tuna on wonton crackers  which was the best dish of the night   While expensive  the starter was good   The ahi tuna was nicely mixed with seaweed and gingered sesame vinaigrette   The tuna mixture sat on light and crispy fried wontons   The tuna was fresh   It was also quite spicy   I also had the bangers and mash   The mashed potatoes were good   They were very light for mashed potatoes and had a good flavor   They kind of reminded me of the mashed potatoes at Nick   Stef s in Downtown LA   The bangers were quite bland though   They were moist enough  but they had very little flavor   They sat on a creamy mustard sauce  which was also bland   I tried some of my friend s fries  which were just okay  a little soft    My friend mentioned that the fish and chips were bland   Service was decent   The staff was friendly  but it was hard to flag down our waiter at times  which is a common problem when you eat outside and the outside dining area is not that connected to the inside dining area    Prices were not too bad for Las Vegas   There were several entrees below       However  for the quality of food  you can find better gastropub food in other cities at similar or lower prices   Though we liked the ahi tuna on wonton crackers  the entrees were very disappointing and I am not sure if the other entrees would be any better   I did like the little sampling of Todd English s food at the LA event  and he is a very charming  funny and smart guy   but I think his more upscale Olives in The Bellagio is probably a better representation of his skills in the kitchen   Todd English PUB is located right next to Aria   Aria has its own free parking structure and it is easy to find a space  valet parking is also available  ,2,2012-01-24
The menu looks good  nice pub atmosphere    convenient if you re staying in the Aria     But   the food was missing something even though it was pricey for bar type food  Chicken Parmesan sliders      for   were bland   boring The    oyster of the day was meh  Quiche Lorraine       was bland  Hot dog       was huge but unimpressive  It came with fries which I dipped in their black truffle mayo  This was the only tasty item  The service was good but won t return for      with tip  lunch that was blah ,2,2013-12-28
I thought I would like this place when I walked in and some good    s grunge music was playing rather than that annoying clubbing music you tend to hear all over Vegas    Great food and great service  The lobster rolls were SO GOOD  Little pricey  but you re in Vegas so it s not that unusual for the prices to be higher  You can add extra lobster rolls for    each to your order  Definitely worth it ,5,2013-02-26
I went to Vegas to visit my boyfriend and celebrate my birthday  This place was on the top of my boyfriend s list for places to take me while I was in town  Great place  We just went to have some beers and appetizers    We sat at the bar and scored seats right by the Spurs vs Mavericks game which was a huge plus  They have an amazing beer selection and so many tasty foods to choose from  We went with the Duck Buns and the Lobster Poppie  Both were excellent  The Duck Buns were like   little steamed buns you would get at dim sum  It s shredded duck  hoisin sauce and chopped scallions  Great balance of flavor and the actual bun was nice and fluffy  The Lobster Poppie was yorkshire pudding  creamy corn and brown butter sauce  It was a huge pastry pop over with lobster and all the other creamy goodness  Both were great and went well with beer    Our bartender that served was great  He was nice and checked on us frequently  Along the bar there are hour glasses on stands  The thing with those is that if you order a beer and you finish before the sand runs out  seven seconds  you get it for free  We thought about doing it but we were just getting started for the evening   maybe next time    This is definitely going on my return list  When I m back in Vegas I will hitting up this place  Maybe I ll even try for a free beer ,4,2011-01-26
We came here for lunch and this is a mixed review of our experience at the PUB  Jesse got one of the burgers and I was so tired of burgers  I ended up with Pasta dish with Chicken  It was a big mistake  My pasta was bland with only two pieces of chicken  I should have known better  not to order pasta dish here   We also ordered Buffalo Wings which were yummy  Jesse liked his burger  Our server was great  I m willing to give PUB another try next time when I m in Vegas  I will get the burger though  No more pasta ,3,2013-07-18
My husband and I got breakfast here this morning and we were really disappointed  I would expect the egg sandwich here to be amazing but it was anything but  Cold plain bun  barely there avocado  cold scrambled eggs  The bacon was great I ll give them that  It was just blah and fell apart completely  It looks like such a great place maybe it was an off day ,1,2014-07-28
The food is solid and the beer selection is great   only problem   they are always sold out of several and usually my first choice  My first time here I went with a work party and all    of us ordered beer    of the    were out  The second time I was there with a group of    again my first choice was sold out  Disappointing    The food is great  The Lobster Rolls are really unique and delicious  If you like Lobster  they are a must try  The pretzels and junk chips are really good apps  The Reuben is also a solid Sandwich  but I won t order any entree other than those Lobster Rolls ,4,2017-09-20
