Worth the line up   I m visiting Toronto and my local friends raved about this place so we went here after brunch  It was definitely worth the    minute walk and another     minute line up    First at the door  you re inundated with all the crazy possible combinations of ice cream flavours and cookies  The wait won t even feel that long after just reading the menu and trying to decide what you want  The only downside here is that because it s so small  you ll be waiting outside and when it s busy  which is apparently almost all the time   you re only allowed to sample one flavour  Which is too bad since there were so many unique flavours    I was lucky enough to actually get away with sampling    totaro and matcha genmaicha     Flavours  Matcha genmaicha was an interesting mix of the two   I think I d rather have these flavours separated  I ended up getting the totaro and olive pistachio  Totaro was amazing  and olive pistachio was good although the olive part isn t super strong  I want to go back and try a different flavour  but totaro is a keeper and sweeter than the olive pistachio  I got this with a half sized birthday flavour cookie which was soft and chewy  and a great combination with the ice cream    Friend who is gluten free always gets the vegan flavours and gluten free cookies  She loves going back to Bang Bang to get these and wishes they had more variety in vegan ice cream    Price  Like all hipster ice cream places these days  it s a little expensive but definitely worth it    I m tempted to make the long walk back here before leaving to try their bubble waffle   ice cream combo    definitely worth the visit ,5,2017-10-29
This place is amazing  I got the earl grey ice cream in the regular puff  The puff was crumbly on the outside and chewy on the inside and went perfectly with the earl grey   They have so many different flavours of ice cream and I can t wait to try them all ,4,2017-08-19
This little shop smells SO good when you walk inside  It s rustic ambiance is cute and they have a variety of gourmet ice cream  I got the waffle cone with raspberry and avocado ice cream  It was delicious  To the eye the waffle looks huge but between two people it s great  but surely can be eaten alone  Highly recommend for the sweet tooth addicts  ,5,2017-10-27
I don t understand the hype  but that s probably because I am not a huge ice cream fan in the first place  Came here on a weekday in the afternoon  there was no line and it was    degrees out so we thought eh why not  ice cream    Spent more     on two ice cream scoops in a cup and one ice cream sandwich  I had no clue the ice cream sandwich was gonna be THAT massive  I could only stomach     of it and I thought it was such a waste of money  It was overly sweet and while I enjoyed the first spoon it became too sugary for my taste  and I do love my sweets   I think I had flavors like cookies and cream and dulce de leche so that s probably why    We didn t know where to go to eat our already melting ice cream so we just sat on the sidewalk next to traffic  there is no indoor seating   All in all  a very meh experience  but at least we ve given it a try ,2,2016-07-16
This place is busy  Line up all the way out into the street  They have two lines  one for those who know what they are ordering  and another for first timers  or people who don t know what they want  I still haven t really figured out how these two line ups work  because everyone just forms one line  We waited about half an hour to get to the front  What can I say  well worth the wait  Their London Fog ice cream is amazing ,5,2015-05-02
Nothing is more exciting than ice cream on a cold and snowy day  We were super lucky to have got here right before the store closed  We ordered the lychee with raspberry ice cream inside the birthday cake and everything cookie  This place reminds me of Baked Bear in the west coast but with elevated ice cream  It was a great dessert after the play we saw across the street  This is a great spot for a date  I highly recommend it  It s also perfect after a dinner  The restaurants around the ice cream shop looked fancy and could really help you impress your date  ,5,2018-02-12
Tuesday     pm surprisingly short lineup for such a hot day   a rarity        for a half ice cream sandwich is a steal in this day and age  Everything about it was delicious and it was the perfect amount  I got the chocolate cookie with   choices of ice cream  London fog and golden oreo  So many flavors to choose from ,5,2018-08-15
The ice cream sandwiches are great   the cookies are thin and not very sweet  which is a good thing   and there is a big variety of unique ice cream flavours   The only thing i did not like about this place is how slow the service is   Wait time is typically over   mins  more on weekends with nice weather  ,4,2016-07-17
Bang Bang into my mouth  I know you want it   Forgive the parody of the Jessie J song  but yes  Bang Bang is really good  Ice cream of many kinds  cream puffs  cookies and HK WAFFLES  CAN YOU GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT    D   Not many places in Toronto do HK waffles  They do it well here  The ice cream flavours are interesting  different and not to mention delicious  The cookies are good too  and the ice cream sammies are excellent too    The only downside I ll say  is that it s somewhat difficult to find  I recommend Bang Bang on a nice summer day when you re walking in the neighbourhood   Bang Bang  that awesome sound  and taste   Bang Bang   ,5,2016-06-01
The lineup was unbelievably long  you would think that that must mean it s amazing   It honestly was not  I have tasted multiple ice cream sandwiches in Toronto that tasted better  Seems really overrated  However  it did not taste BAD  it just didn t meet up to my expectations ,2,2015-11-08
Who doesn t like Bang Bang      Bang Bang is not a spot you d try once and move along  You ll come back  and back  and probably back for a  nd time the same day  If you re not sure what it is  essentially it s an ice cream parlour where you can get your ice cream in the form of a sammie between cookies  puff pastry  macaron or even a cinnamon bun  If you re more about the cone life  you can also get it with a sugar  waffle or HK waffle cone  There are so many ways to have your ice cream dessert  this is why you will keep coming back   There are a number of different ice cream flavours   many of asian related flavors  My favourite is anything matcha or milk tea related  Their taro isn t bad either   Tip  come during weekdays right before dinner to avoid the rush   this worked for on many occasions  Also  don t forget to get their loyalty card because I m highly certain you ll go again ,5,2016-09-21
Got the Vegan Mango Coconut and Vegan Vanilla bean with a waffle cone  The ice cream was for me  I m lactose intolerant  and the waffle was for my boyfriend  The mango coconut ice cream also came with hot sticky rice  It was great ,4,2018-05-26
Staff is friendly and helpful  It does take a little bit when they are busy though  On the other hand  you can always ask for a tester before you commit to a flavour   They keep their popular flavours consistent and available  so you can never go wrong with a listed choice you see often    My favourite is the Matcha Tiramisu  You can actually taste a bit of booze in it  Another good one is the Rosewater  The raspberry bits are quite lovely    Their waffles are also made fresh  which is a plus    Don t forget to get your stamp card stamped  Every   th is a free  I think ,5,2018-03-21
Came here with my friends  we all ordered something different  I ordered a half sammy  with London fog ice cream  I personally love a Earl Grey Tea latte  so eating that was basically the latte in solid form  ice cream form at least   There was sufficient tea flavour as well as creaminess  which made it super enjoyable  I have heard the lines here are no joke  but we came on a Tuesday night  and was able to come in before the crowd came in   The place itself is not big  so it s a place where you d grab your ice cream and leave the store  no room to loiter or sit inside    But if you are ever downtown  I would suggest you hit up this place  cause it was SUPER delicious ,5,2018-09-19
Had a half ice cream sandwich  Was a busy night so expected things to be fresh  The ice cream was very good but cookie was very hard and did ruin the dessert  Ended up throwing out the cookie ,3,2018-09-10
Ice cream is good   Had the PB and J and it was very satisfying   Only problem with this place is that it is not worth the wait especially when there is no reason for it   Slow service is the only reason the line even exists  I understand the optics    big line so it must be good   Great location should keep these guys in business   Ice cream is good  the value of your half hour to get it is the real debate ,3,2016-06-06
I ve had way better ice cream from Kawartha Dairy  Even some flavors from the supermarket are better   The avocado ice cream  wrapped in the homemade waffle I took two bites and threw it away  The burnt toffee between a peanut butter cookie tasted very regular  I will NOT be going back  p s   hour line up  pay with credit card then you have to tip  Totally ridiculous,1,2015-07-11
Yummmm    My very first time trying Bangbang      Food Ice Cream  I ordered the Chestnut Matcha and Totaro  The chestnut matcha was okay  I should have ordered the plain matcha  but it was more chestnut with swirls of matcha  I didn t really taste the chestnut that much and the matcha swirls  The totaro however was the best  I got the hongkong waffle and it just really complimented the ice cream  So yummy  The hongkong waffle was made fresh so it was still nice and warm when it was served with ice cream    Decor  It was simple  No seats in the shop  It smelled good in there  though lol  It smelled like cake  I was already salivating even before I went in lol  No lie    Service  I heard that there are usually line ups here  But I came on a weekday during the afternoon and no one was there    Next time  I would like the Nutella Puff with ice cream in it  Yes please ,4,2015-10-13
Because of my boyfriend   This has become quite  as my boyfriend would call it  a  hotspot  for frozen dairy goodness and I don t see why not   The ice cream is to die for  they have so many flavours and what makes it even better is that it s all made from scratch which means you know there s alot of TLC going into every spoonful  lick and bite you take   My go flavour has got to be the  Totaro   which is a play on name for the Japanese ambiguous character  Totoro and the vegetable root  taro  It is a beautiful purple colour and tastes ambrosia  The ice cream can be served in either a cup  HK style egg waffle cone  bowl lined with wax paper or in one of their original hand made cookie sandwiches  I always go for the HK style egg waffle cone because it s the best and it s pretty filling   PROS  Hand made ice cream   deliciousness in every mouthful   they do sampling     CONS  Always a line up   price   Boyfriend always treats so I don t know  lol        P S  I have had other flavours   Totaro  is the one everyone should try   P P S  Boyfriend and I are on an ice cream strike for one month so after that  BANG BANG for us  D,5,2016-06-20
Was lucky to show up without a line but heard this place can have a huge wait time  The ice cream sandwitch was great  Had the everything cookies with burn toffee ice cream  Tasted great and huge portion  Also a decent price ,4,2015-07-12
This place is amazing  I stumbled upon it while dining   OddSeoul located right across the street  and thought we should stop over for some dessert  There is a huge selection of awesome and unique ice cream flavours  Their menu has a variety of options  such as the bubble waffles  cookie sandwiches  or cream puff  or scoops   I went for the Totaro   taro flavour     Avocado  Both were so smooth and delicious  The flavours felt so authentic  to its name  I love this place  and if ever make my way to Ossington St  I ll definitely stop over  ,5,2017-03-30
Bang Bang is the expanded offspring of Bakerbots  Baking located outside the Delaware entrance to the Ossington Station  You will find the same ice cream there  yet maybe     times the choices at Bang Bang   Bang Bang is delicious and really not bad for the price  For what you would pay for a fancier drink at Starbucks  you can get a half of large ice cream stuffed cookie   I think the long sidewalk waits and lack of seats are annoying  especially when it is cool cold out  However  the ice cream is a winner ,5,2016-04-02
Got the famous waffle with icecream  It was really good  I like the choice of flavors   The ice cream sandwich looks also amazing   The only bad thing is the huge lineup during summer ,4,2016-06-04
Great quality ice cream with a unique variety of flavours  I had the Totaro  purple yam and coconut  and earl grey in a cup  with an egg waffle on the side  Unlike other egg waffle places  the waffle here is more  eggy  than sweet  I personally liked this but just an FYI  I do recommend getting ice cream and waffle separately because the waffle gets soggy at the bottom if you use it as a cone  Their other flavours include honey  chocolate  various fruity sorbets  and a selection of vegan flavours too  Prices are on par with those at gelato stores  Would recommend if you are a huge ice cream fan  Gave this place     stars because I don t think it s worth the huge line  but if you can manage to go there when there isn t a line  it s definitely worth checking out ,4,2017-07-31
Awesome ice cream place  Hong Kong waffles was good  but a little too sweet  The fact that they only have one working waffle maker is a drag  It took us almost half an hour to have   waffle orders  I had the totaro ice cream  Very good ice cream  It was not too sweet and very tasty  Place is small so nowhere to sit and enjoy the ice cream  The server that served us was not competent  but it was her first day  She gave me the wrong order and charged me with the wrong price  They didn t do anything to compensate for the mistakes  I think they should have  Overall  it wasn t too bad  but they should work on customer service ,3,2015-10-10
This is my  nd visit to this place since last year  It wasn t as good as my expectation  Taste and portion wise were amazing last year  But definitely not today  I got the same thing  Hong Kong egg waffle paired with the double chocolate   espresso ice creams  It tastes ok  but they gave us a very little amount of ice cream  And instead of having only   waffle maker  they should have more maker  so they can serve at a faster rate ,3,2017-07-21
Long lines  especially if you want a waffle  but all in all  a great dessert for a summer evening in Ossington    Word to the wise  full sized sandwiches are not for the weak  Go for the puff or half if you just want a taste ,4,2015-08-01
Customer service  Where is it  If they think they can ride on the quality of their product and desirable location alone  they need to think twice  When they are closing  they are CLOSING  i e  don t bother trying to give them business on a Saturday night at   pm because they will shut the door on your face   Because they re closing and that s the rule  Everyone who works here is mossy   But the ice cream is good ,2,2015-11-22
GIDDY GIDDY BANG BANG    Was in the neighbourhood one late afternoon and had to swing by to check on the line  Lo and behold  it was my time  YES  FINALLY   Obviously picked the puffle  the hong Kong waffle  and selected the Key Lime Pie  I will eat anything key lime   favourite flavour  and ToTARO  for the pun and doodle   The puffle costs       and takes about   minutes to make      stars  I might as well give any ice cream place   stars  The key lime pie was amazing   strong lime flavours with crunchy pie bits     sprinkled throughout it  I m coming back for this  The ToTARO was good  but I honestly barely remember it because of the key lime  I will say it has a great colour though  Puffle was    Average  Nothing outstanding but did the job    I can see what the hype is about and I m going to come back to try their cookies and other flavours ,5,2015-08-11
I really enjoy this place  same owners as Baker Bots  I believe     The ice cream is tasty and has a variety of unique flavours you won t find anywhere else  The dairy free options are limited  but those they do have are fantastic    I ve only tried the traditional ice cream sandwich  and haven t tried the puff pastry or macaron options  But the cookies are good  And even the gluten free cookie is good  I find most aren t     I think the half sandwich is the way to go   as someone who enjoys eating a lot of ice cream  I think the full sandwich would be too much  But maybe you re more adventurous than I am    The obvious downside is the long lines in the summer  I think it s worth it though ,4,2014-11-09
   Ice cream sandwich   half portion  Gingerr cookie  with chunks of candied ginger    cinnamon toast ice cream   I really like the homemade ice cream  It was creamy and flavourful  Cinnamon was not overpowering and did taste like Cinnamon Toast Crunch    Cookie wasn t too sweet or ginger y  Overall  I would go back  There was a lineup after dinner on a weeknight but worth the wait ,4,2014-06-21
The wait line was longgggg  Probably       mins  There s really no banner that says Bang Bang Ice Cream  there is small letters on the window   so you might walk by and not see it  however  you will notice a long line forming  You can see all the flavors written on tin canisters when you walk in  You can choose to have an ice cream sandwich  a cup  cone  or egg puff  I ended up getting the matcha in a cup  It was good  but I think I enjoyed my brother s totaro and my sister s burnt toffee better  If I do come back  I would like to try other flavors ,4,2017-08-03
Pros  Interesting flavours Location  Cons VERY HYPED   Consistantly long lines  and not worth the wait The long wait The odd flavours  Very little safe choices like vanilla or chocolate  Lack of icecream availability High Price  In sum  My bf and I waited in line for    minutes  just to get stuck with only   different flavours to choose from  They still taste good  but out of our own fault we got a parking ticket for     for waiting so long  Total cost of our icecream and parking came to        I know the parking was our fault  but we joke about the time we bought     icecream and waited    minutes to get it ,2,2016-06-16
I consider myself a amateur ice cream connoisseur  and this spot definitely satisfied my sweet tooth  I went mid afternoon on a Tuesday hoping to avoid the long lines  There were only around   people in front of me and the queue moved quickly  The day s flavors were posted on the wall as well as some suggested combinations  Athens woman behind the counter kindly let me try two flavors due to the short line  I ended up getting golden oreo and reeses in a half cookie sandwich  The golden oreo was sweet with large oreo chunks  and the reeses had reeses pieces in it with huge swirls of peanut butter  I would definitely recommend both flavors  it honestly was the best ice cream I ve ever had  I chose the sprinkled cookie which was tasty and had a lemon zest to it ,5,2019-06-26
Bang Bang Ice Cream   Bread Factory drew our attention as it was listed under Thrillist for must eats in Toronto  After a long walk  my husband and I decided to stand on line  yes  there s a line  to consume a hot dessert item  You have the choice to get your choice of ice cream with cookies  bang bang waffle  hk style waffle   cinnabun  cup or cone  My husband went with the London Fog  Earl Grey tea  with oatmeal raisin cookie and I went for a matcha gen mai tea and lychee rose with a bang bang waffle  Both were quite delicious  We are not amateurs when it comes to dessert especially coming from NYC  Bang Bang Ice Cream definitely is a special dessert spot to hit up ,5,2018-09-02
Absolute delight for ice cream lovers  I ve tried quite a few ice cream places and yet this stands out in so many ways  I haven t seen any other place come up with flavours like lychee rosewater or banana truffle  Priced at   CAD  one scoop of bang bang s ice cream is enough to leave you satisfied yet longing for more  They also have a cute little card that they punch everytime you purchase an ice cream and for every ten purchases  one is free  If you like ice cream and are open to experimenting with your flavour palette  this place is a definitely worth a visit ,5,2018-05-21
First off  I love the decor and love the ice cream even more    I got the Totaro and London Fog in an HK waffle cone and it was absolutely worth the    minute line      minute wait    The Totaro was spot on and tasted like real taro  unlike the powdered stuff  London Fog was just exquisite  very delicate flavour and texture  While the ice cream was incredible  the waffle was pretty run of the mill    Overall  just a fabulous place to grab some dessert if you can spare the time ,4,2015-10-30
Love this place  Everything I ve eaten there is delicious   and I have eaten most of the items on the menu  The ice cream was fresh  flavorful and very delicious  I will be back for sure ,4,2015-10-16
Got a hot tip that Bang Bang will be the new ice cream kings and queens in the city so I thought I would check them out for myself  While they haven t officially opened yet  they ve soft launched but are still confirming their full launch date  I was able to sneak in for a Lemon Meringue ice cream sandwich on a Ginger Snap cookie  I m not understating when I saw it was perfect  Not too cold  not too sweet  not too lemony  the cookie was just moist enough to be soft yet crunchy  Perfect   The story  Roseanne  of Bakerbots fame  has opened up a new spot on Ossington with her brother who just happens to make amazing ice cream  That s right  all the goodness of Bakerbots  now with ice cream  They re planning on a full launch in the nearish future so be sure to keep an eye on that store front window  If you re lucky  like I was  you can come away with a more than reasonably priced pound  yes  I said pound  of delicious ice cream for the trip home  Don t forget to buy more to eat at home ,5,2014-05-20
Nice selection of ice cream  Line up can be huge during summer ,4,2015-12-26
Went here with a group of friends after dinner  Got there around     pm and there was a massive lineup  Ordered the bubble waffle  Comes with two scoops of ice cream  Chose mango coconut and lychee sherbet as flavors      after tax  The bubble waffle was made fresh on the spot  Waited for    minutes for them to complete my order  The bubble waffle was still kinda warm when I got it and I had to eat it fast to prevent melting  The ice cream was nice and not too sweet  However I don t think it is worth the    especially if you have to wait ,3,2017-08-04
When the lines aren t crazy it s well worth a visit  New flavours all the time  Cookies  Do what you want ,5,2018-01-19
Someone told my boyfriend Bang Bang always has a huge line up  Of course  we had to go and see what all of the fuss was about   We were there on a weekday around      p m  I think we stood in line for no more than       minutes  The line did get long behind us  though  Some guy stopped his car on Ossington to ask us what we were waiting for   Ice cream   some girl shouted back   Ice cream   Let s pull over   And so the line got longer   We ve been here twice  I had the london fog  earl grey tea flavoured  ice cream    rococoa cookie sammie the first time  It was a pretty good combination  and the cookie added a bit of saltiness which was actually kinda nice   The second time  I decided to try something new  so I picked the fig brie and honey ice cream and paired it with the oatmeal cookie  I have to say  the ice cream was good  but I think it was overpowered by the sweetness and flavour of the cookie  I personally found the combination way too sweet  I traded with my boyfriend and had his london fog in a waffle instead  Oh my god  it was delicious  The waffle was freshly prepared  so it was hot and made things interesting  I think I ll stick to the waffle from now on  it really was that fantastic   What I really like about this place is that it has really unusual flavours that I haven t seen anywhere else  My other go to ice cream parlours are Greg s Ice Cream at Bloor Spadina and The Big Chill at College Manning  They too  have interesting flavours  but nothing like this place  I mean  where else have you seen Avocado  Fig brie honey  Black tea  I need to try this one     Creamed corn  actually   Fruity Loops  Orange Cardamom  and Olive oil ice cream  They also have vegan options  they re at the top of the shelf     You can pick your flavour while you wait in line  there s a big window and all of the flavours are written on stainless steel bucket prominently displayed on a shelf    They play cartoons  we got to watch Sinbad  on the wall while you wait  There s no sound  but you can probably think up some dialogue yourself ,5,2015-07-15
I am an ice cream enthusiast  Bang bang had a wide variety of interesting flavors  I chose the captain peanut cookie with cinnamon toast and burnt toffee ice cream  They were everything I expected and more  It s a tiny shop located on Ossington and I would recommend it      ,5,2018-11-11
Nice grab  and go ice cream  Not much of a sit down spot since it s literally just a counter where u go and they hand you your ice cream and there no tables and chairs  I had vanilla bean for four dollars about and it was delicious  pretty boring order in told  but t had great flavour  There was a huge line up so I don t know of id go and wait that long for ice cream when there are dozens of places around  However they had a lot of interesting flavours and an option for cookie stuffed ice cream and waffle stuffed too which is near and I m told by a girl in line that s worth the wait  I ll go back when ol there s not that major of a line and try   cool new spot though for sure ,3,2015-05-16
I was visiting Toronto for just a weekend and I had the opportunity to try out Bang Bang Ice Cream  I got their London Fog because I had to drive and couldn t try their Matcha Genmai Tiramisu  Or something like that    which contained alcohol  The London Fog was gooood ice cream it was just a tad too sweet for me   Although the line wasn t that long  just out the door and a bit   it still went by quickly and I thought the staff was friendly and efficient  I would definitely come back if I m in town again to try the other flavors ,4,2017-03-29
The ice cream was really good  I came here in the summer and it s perfect for warm summer days  The ice cream was creamy and Bang Bang has a variety of unique flavours  The egg waffle was delicious and smelled wonderful  It s pricier for sure but worth the big portions and great taste ,5,2016-12-27
Had the Totaro and Cinnamon Toast flavor in full cookie sandwich and it was as good as I expected  I imagine the cinnamon toast with cinnamon roll would be even better  Definitely  plan on visiting again next time I am in town ,5,2019-05-30
One of those random days  my buddy and I wanted ice cream  Went to another popular ice cream spot but looking at the line up we just walked away  Decided to try Bang Bang  and it was well worth it  Went on a Wednesday evening around     pm  line up was reasonable  Overall would say    minutes in total     minutes waiting to order and around    minutes for them to make it   fresh     They have cookies  ice cream  ice cream sandwiches  pre made items  and the Hong Kong waffle cone  Went with   waffle cones came up to      You get to choose two flavors  There is a waiting game but the staff were nice enough to come outside and look for us with our cones    Went with cookies and cream   hazelnut and vanilla bean   hazelnut  First time trying Hong Kong waffles  and it was great Soft rich taste  wasn t too soggy or fall apart  The ice cream clearly didn t come from plastic tub from your local grocery store  Would highly recommend the hazelnut flavor  tastes better then Nutella in my opinion    The area has limited parking  There is a wait but its not as long compared to other places  plus you can walk around in the area  Overall give it      it made my day ,5,2016-05-14
Hadn t been back in awhile but Bang Bang s ice cream is still amazing  Hands down THE best ice cream I ve had  Their London Fog is perfection    They ve added puffs to their menu which I though was mediocre  Another thing I did notice was their service seemed slower than before  Again  like my last post  well worth the wait ,5,2016-09-12
Delicious   Don t let the lineup put you off  this place is great   I had the Sweet Corn and Cap N Crunch ice cream and my friend had the Strawberry  I wasn t keen to try the Sweet Corn  but they gave us a small spoonful to try and I was sold  It was like a delicious caramel  but not overly sweet  packed with chunks of Cap n Crunch cereal  The Strawberry  though  was my favourite of the two  absolutely delicious   The lineups can get crazy  even late at night  but the staff is really friendly and the ice cream is fantastic  Can t recommend it enough ,4,2014-07-27
We arrived after lunch on a Sunday  Not much of a line up outside but a little bit of a wait for the HK waffle  I loved the matcha chestnut  I could eat it everyday  Definitely worth the wait  ,5,2015-05-25
The line up is crazy during the Summer but I really enjoy their ice cream  I had the ice cream sandwich and the Hong Kong waffle ice cream and I d have to say  the line up is worth it ,5,2015-09-21
Wandered around for ice cream until our feet hurt  and made it to bang bang while we were hangry  and saw the stupid line  Luckily the weather was nice so we didnt have a problem waiting it out and it ended up being stupid good  Had the waffle with totoro and cinnamon toast crunch  Still remembering that yummy totoro  Boyfriend had the mint ice cream sammie  They accept cash and credit  but not debit  however there is an atm in the store as well ,5,2016-06-04
If you are in a big lineup   take comfort they keep the line moving  You have time to decide on what you want and time to prepare your stomach for awesomeness you are about to consume      The staff did an excellent job keeping the line moving   My ice cream was worth the wait   as per Yelpers advice  I went for the waffle cone   OMG soooo good   They told us how long it would take   wonderful  efficient   great job   TIP  be ready to eat your waffle cone   it s warm and it melts your ice cream   it s a task to tackle  but soooo tasty    I did take a bite of the ice cream sammies   Best one ever   The combos we got    waffle cone with burnt toffee ice cream and toasted marshmallow    everything cookie with cinnamon toast ice cream  Love that you can get half an ice cream sammie   more than enough to satisfy   Enjoy ,5,2018-08-20
Another favourite spot in the Ossington area  They have the perfect blend of ice creams and they sell out fast    Summer is pretty much here so expect line up for as long as   min   I would   It s the only ice cream joint in the area that offers cookie ice cream sandwiches  ice cream on Hong Kong waffles  freshly made   That s usually the reason for the long line  Samples are allowed but during peak times  please don t sample more than   flavours   We got two scoops of Lychee Rosewater and Totaro  Taro flavour  in a freshly made Hong Kong egg waffle  It s Bomb  Just order what we ordered if you dont know what to order         Food       Line up        Service      Ambience,4,2017-06-05
Living in the neigbbourhood  this is my go to spot for ice cream  Their wide variety of flavours of ice cream  baked goods  and specialties such as the hk waffle is just so great all year round   However  my favourite thing to get here are the ice cream sammies  each time with a different flavour as they often have new flavours  But to name some flavours  I highly recommend avocado  london fog  and lemon meringue  Side not  they re not open on Mondays ,5,2018-04-07
As good as it gets for combo of amazing baked goods and unique  but not too granola  flavours of ice cream  But the line every night should tell you that ,5,2018-12-05
Salted peanutbutter ice cream  Rocky road  I m gettin me a waffle next time  Maybe today  ,5,2017-10-14

Been here a couple of times   Line ups are long but well worth it   My favourite has to be the burnt toffee ,4,2018-09-20
Hong Kong waffle is really good  Too bad it takes too long to get it   waited for    mins on a saturday night  ard  pm   they should definitely get another few Waffle machines to speed up the process,4,2015-08-31
This review is only about the ice cream  I am not an ice cream person  But golly  this place is amazing  We Came with with a few friends who had recommended the place to us  The line was quite long as we waited about    minutes  No one complains about the wait because everyone understands and knows Bang Bang is worth the wait  I had the London Fog ice cream which was fantastic  I will definitely be coming back again  I find myself often craving for London Fog ice cream  I am so addicted ,4,2014-07-13
Its ice cream and its not just vanilla and chocolate  Nothing better than this place after dinner  Go for the cinnamon toast crunch icecream with the ginger snap cookies as a combo and you cannot go wrong  ,5,2018-07-07
Went on a thursday evening and it wasn t too busy  but they do take their time with each order  I ordered a scoop of the london fog and totaro   taste was ok  nothing amazing  Totaro flavor was a bit creamy and it had chips of ice throughout  not very thoroughly blended  I was very put off with the way they prepared the ice cream sandwiches though  Which is why i only ordered scoops  no direct hand contact involved with the food  The cashier who takes your order is also the one who makes it   and it was disgusting to see them handle cash and then go directly to preparing your order without washing their hands or putting on gloves  I witnessed this being done for the two people in front of me   Cannot believe this is how they handle food  mKes me question what else they slack on behind doors ,2,2017-10-03
After hearing about a shop selling egg waffles and ice cream  my friends and I were instantly drawn to this place  We went here on a hot day because we thought the ice cream would be a good cooler  Unfortunately  we were very let down  First of all  there isn t any sign above the bakery indicating the name so we ended up walking right past the shop without even noticing  We were greeted by a long line expanding past a few shops down the street  After waiting     minutes  we entered a very crammed bakery with employees frantically running around to complete the orders  I noticed that the employees seemed to not be very familiar with using an egg waffle maker and actually served some people burnt egg waffles     yikes  I ordered the hong kong egg waffle with totoro  ube   lychee    and raspberry ice cream and it came to nearly      Not at all worth it  If you ve ever had  real  hong kong egg waffles before  you ll know that what they were serving was a much lower quality rendition  The waffle was hard and had a strange after taste in comparison to normal egg waffles  The ice cream was also on the warmer side and too soft  almost melted  when they served it to me  The taste was okay     but honestly buying a container of Ben   Jerry s would ve been better    I definitely don t recommend this place  seeing as you can get much better egg waffles and ice cream at the near by china town for a fraction of the price  Not to mention the fact that the chinese bakeries selling egg waffles are much more efficient  usually only takes   minutes  I can see why this place would be appealing to tourists and people who are not familiar with hong kong street food but anyone who goes here is definitely getting robbed ,2,2015-08-07
My S O brought me here once as he knows I have a soft spot for ice cream and we ve been back many times   I have tried the macaron and because it was larger than the average macaron it s a little overwhelmingly sweet  dense and chewy in the center  The cookies are fairly good but it s the taro red bean pastry that keeps me coming back every time  The london fog ice cream is perfect  Creamy with a subtle and not overwhelming flavor of obviously   london fog  Haven t tried all their flavors but I WILL     The first time I was there with my S O we were near the cash table and the person cashing the people out before us  I m pretty sure she s the owner  gave them a coupon for a coffee shop  which we later found out was for Sam James Coffee Bar  I had no idea the coffee bar was down the street and I didn t know you have to order the  SJCB icecream  to get a  SJCB  coupon  I didn t even know what the abbreviation for SJCB stood for on the ice cream box  I thought it was sweet  so I said something along the lines of   That s nice of them  I wonder where that coffee shop is  to my boyfriend  She must have heard me in an earshot because she then made a snarky remark that I had to buy the ice cream to get the coupon  It was good that she told me  I guess or I would ve been misguided but man  there was definitely some judgement or hostility behind that  I don t want to say it was like a  hipster local   God knows I hate the word hipster  couldn t be bothered to explain something to you attitude but it kinda felt like it   But alas  I have never had to deal with her again as the other people behind the counter are always sweet and the ice cream is so good that I ll gladly take her ice cream crafting skills and steer clear of saying anything stupid in front of her ,5,2015-01-07
So many times dropped there  Bubble waffle very crispy outside soft and chewy inside  Totaro ice cream is my favorite  Bangbang is an iceream heaven  you must try        Love it ,5,2016-04-02
Ice cream here was great really creamy  I got flavours London Fog and Golden Oreo in a Hong Kong Waffle Cone  Golden Oreo was my favourite and actually had bits of crushed Golden Oreo cookie in it  I thought the cone was going to be warm but oh well  other than that the line moved quick and the employees were nice  I m definitely coming back to try some more ,5,2017-10-07
Great cookies and ice cream  but they need to improve their work flow a bit  I wonder if they purposefully created an inefficient process flow to create that lineup  and therefore the hype   When we get inside the actual place  you can see that one person takes your order  gets the cookie  gets the ice cream  gives it to you  and  god forbid  rings you out  That is way too slow and it s not like there is any added benefit to the experience  If anything  the air in the place is stressful  packed  and full of hungry anxious ice cream lovers  There is also no crowd control  The night I went  a man barged his way in front of at least    patrons  some who were waiting at least     hours   and placed his order first  I shouted at the top of my lungs that I hoped he get diarrhea from eating his ice cream and others also threatened him with other bad things like  I hope Microsoft Word crashes when you re writing an    page essay without saving it   I hope Auto Recovery decides to not help you   The woman serving him  had no idea  that he wasn t the next person in line  and it really infuriated other customers  I know it s not her fault if she was super busy and overwhelmed  but there needs to be a system in place to ensure fairness to the other patrons who wait a goddamn long time to enjoy this magical cum in your pants ice cream  I still love you  Bang Bang  and I would still bang you  XO ,3,2015-08-23
Best icecream I ve ever had   Rich flavour and very very creamy   The staff was very nice as well   Can t wait to go back ,5,2017-03-06
My friend and I wanted to try out this place since we heard such awesome things about it  and we were extremely pleased  We were taking a while to look at the menu and the employee at the counter called us over to try some samples and help us figure out what we wanted  Nice right  I got an ice cream sandwich  with rocky road kill ice cream and an everything cookie  Wow was that delicious  There are so many flavours and combinations to try  They also have stamp cards for the avid repeat customer    Check them out ,5,2016-07-07
I had the hong kong style egg waffle in Chinatown a few times and wanted to try it out with ice cream   Read about this Ice cream   Bakery place and went to check it out   The shop is small  just   really small benches enough to seat maybe     adults max   It s a place where you order and go   Luckily the evening my friend and I visited  it wasn t as busy  we got to sit   It did get busier as we sat and ate our ice cream waffle  The London fog ice cream that many recommended tasted very good  that s if you like Earl Grey flavour    Earl Grey tea is one of my favourite   I also got the taro flavoured ice cream very good as well  when you order the ice cream waffle you get to choose   flavours for     pricey     My friend had the key lime ice cream and he loved it   He did not like the green tea ice cream   The waffle was over cooked so it was too harder than I expected   The ice cream waffles were good and I ll visit again but it would be awhile  too sweet  and I would just order the unique ice cream flavours to Go and skip the waffle   Just be aware  If you decide to stay  your hair and coat will end up smelling like burned waffles  The customer service could improve  the staff were not as friendly  wished they were   Didn t felt as welcomed as we ordered our ice cream waffles   They didn t even smile and looked pissed at the large crowd that was coming in ,3,2016-01-06
WOW  I had never been so excited about ice cream in my life  I was visiting my sister in TO  and after I saw the pictures  I had to give this place a try   It was a chilly Saturday  so the line outside was not ridiculous  We were in line for only about   min  My sister says that they have done      min lines  and I think it is totally worth it   After we made the order for   people  we had to wait around   min for   waffle cones to be ready  For what I saw  they only had one girl making waffles  and only   waffle makers  They really should add more ppl machines  The cookie sandwiches were made right away   The everything cookie was sooo good  And the Hazelnut ice cream was my favorite  but they change the flavors regularly  The waffle smelled a little too much like egg  but I was so into the mix of waffle and ice cream  that it did not bothered me that much  My sister couldn t eat it though     The portions are extra Large  So embrace the sugar rush afterwards  My husband finished the complete cookie sandwich  and I did the whole waffle cone by myself  but a normal person could share them   As any other place in Toronto  parking can be tricky  but we found parking on the streets around that block   The pictures are totally instragram material  I will definitely go back for more when in Toronto area ,5,2017-09-25
If you care to line up  this may be some of the best ice cream in the city  I really only lined up for these flavours  Taro and Chestnut Matcha    Went on a Saturday night around       Lined up for about    mins  and they ran out of HK Style Waffles  boo  so got an ice cream sandwich instead    If you like Bang Bang but don t like waiting in line  I suggest you go to Bakerbots in the Ossington area instead  They serve the same ice cream sandwiches but with fewer ice cream options and no HK waffles ,4,2015-07-11
Hands down the best cookie I ve ever had in my life  Got the oatmeal cookie with burnt toffee ice cream  Amazing  Didn t have to wait too long in the line up    went on a thursday evening  Will definitely be returning ,5,2015-07-01
My favourite icecream place since it s close to work and no line ups during lunch  Icecream flavours are pretty unique and taste great and bakery items like cookies and puffs make the experience just a bit more fun  They also have a stamp card that gets you free icecream after    stamps ,5,2016-04-21
The vanilla ice cream has specs of vanilla  Very flavourful and creamy  Perfect    The cookies are delicious too   Weekdays there aren t the long line ups people complain about  Thankfully they re close enough to walk to from work so I can take the occasional ice cream break    In trendy Ossington  a perfect area with a variety of places for lunch  Union  Bellwoods if they re open   then top it off with a coffee  Crafted   and something baked combined with ice cream here at Bang Bang  So many options  the hardest part is deciding what to try next ,5,2016-05-15
Cinnamon Roll  and made to order waffles had me salivating at their sight and smell  and my friends tried both and gave them very high thumbs up    I opted for an ice cream sandwich instead    The Everything Cookie is  well  EVERYTHING it s hyped up to be  A     As was my customized ice cream half  Sammie  which consisted of an EVERYTHING cookie and one scoop of corn flakes ice cream plus one scoop of burnt toffee ice cream ,5,2018-07-29
Egg waffles that kicks the asses of those places in Pacific mall  It blows away the crap we got in NYC  Thought it was funny having the token asian making the egg waffles the night we went  Wait was not long for us  we ordered four egg waffle cones  Probably short because it was chilly and it was a weeknight  Total wait time was probably from getting on line to leaving was maybe    minutes  The ice cream was also delicious  So many interesting flavors  Should ve tried a cookie too    Now  would I wait longer than    minutes to get an egg waffle cone  Most likely not  I wasn t going to wait if the line was a block long  Our line up started at the door to BangBang  If you want just ice cream or cookies  it shouldn t take as long as the egg waffles which are made to order    Go if you ve never been  And if you ve been there  skip the egg waffles as their ice cream is great on its own or maybe even better with one of their awesome looking cookies ,5,2016-05-25
Best ice cream in town  All the flavours that I ve tried were really good  Highly recommend avocado  chocolate and sour cherry  I can t give   starts because of unfriendly service   ,4,2017-12-28
Love their burnt toffee ice cream   I must say this is the BEST ice cream place in Toronto ,5,2018-02-05
Came back to try the Nutella Cream Puff shell an it was amazing   So worth it  so delicious  I had it with the Love oolong Time  oolong  ice cream  which was the perfect combination because it s not as sweet    I also tried the Cookies  N Cream  Hazelnut and Burnt Toffee flavors  Each flavor is so heavenly  but I think I ve decided that my favourite flavor is the Love oolong Time ,5,2016-04-02
Amazing avocado ice cream     We ordered and egg waffle ice cream with a scope of avocado and a scope of taro   Flavour was Heavenly but the price is a little bit up there  I believe it was    for that particular order   The waffle was fresh off the press  The ice cream texture and flavour was ON POINT   Justifying small batches with the price makes it ok I guess   I would definitely go back to try out the other flavours ,4,2018-06-03
Great ice cream tucked on the ossington strip  Their taro and burnt marshmellow is so delish  Not sure if I will wait in line for over an hour again though  but the ice cream here is definitely worth the hype  They can make icecream sandwich out of cookies and can also do HK waffle icecream as well  though not as authentic the waffles   a little thicker  Price is a little high but quality of the product is worth it ,4,2016-04-10
Loads of unique ice cream flavors  We went on a Friday night at  pm and the line was out of the door  With a line that long  you know the flavors are banging      I tried the totoro  ube flavor  and the london fog  milk tea   Both flavors were on point  the ube had the classic taro purple yam flavor and the london fog tasted just like a iced milk tea  It was a cold night and I still managed to eat both scoops in record time  If I could refer one ice cream joint to sample in Toronto  I think this joint is a must ,5,2017-04-23
I would recommend this place for sure  it was fairly busy but worth waiting for Ice Cream   It is the best place to get REAL ICE CREAM  and lots of varieties  The restaurant signature is Ice cream   Drop in   treat yourself ,5,2017-11-12
There s quite a bit of ice cream flavours to choose from and so far all of them have been great  tried the HK milk tea  and earl gray  plus options to put it in an egg waffle or cookie or cup cone  Although it s a little bit away from the city center  the travel is worth the wait for interesting  unique flavours  There s always a line for ice cream  but service is really quick so you don t have to wait too long  I have been two times already and will be returning as one of my favourite go to ice cream places ,5,2018-08-20
My mouth was watering when I looked at this place s yelp page  so without a second thought  I hit this place on the cheat day  I came here on Saturday evening and there was a crazy line up  Since I am a lazy and Impatient person  I decided to come again in next day right after they open the door and it turns out to be a right decision  Ordered Hong Kong waffle with chocolate frosty burnt toffee and nutella puff with metcha chestnut  For the waffle  it is amazing  Warm since it is fresh prepared as ordered  Crispy outside  soft inside  For the ice cream  what I like is its thickness  smoothness  refreshment not greasy  not too sweet   what I don t like is its tasteless  I can hardly tell the one I ate is metcha  For the puff  it is average  Virtually no layer  it is thin  Kind of disappointing   This is the kind of place you think you have to go  but after you ve actually been there  it is  meh   The Hong Kong waffle worth a try  Wait for   min  I d rather come early ,4,2015-05-18
I was a    she was a     We ate ice cream while taking pics   I ordered dark  she ordered white   She would always lose my sight      BANG BANG  I ordered a pound   BANG BANG  my taste buds hit the ground   BANG BANG  a taste so profound   BANG BANG  best ice cream in town ,4,2016-05-12
Wow people wait over an hour for this      I came on a Saturday afternoon and the line was just a few people out the door  so I figured it wouldn t take too long  I d say it was about      min    Got the icecream in a hong kong waffle  The ice cream was pretty good compared to a normal store  But there are plenty of good ice cream places in Toronto that serve ice cream that is just as good but without the wait  The waffle itself was only  okay    the Hong Kong waffle that I get from Pacific mall is better  and cheaper   I have to say that I liked the combo of ice cream and waffle though    Think its fairly expensive at just under    for the combo  I doubt that I ll return even if there is no line    If there is a   min line    f no ,3,2015-09-07
Been going to Bang Bang for years so I ve tried a decent amount of their flavours and I would say my favourites are probably     London Fog   Just better than the other places that offer it though I rarely get it because it s a common flavour   Matcha Tiramisu   Has chunks of tiramisu in it  Has strong matcha flavour and isn t overly sweet which I find happens at a lot of places  It s also not so strong that it s kind of bitter    Mango Pudding with Coconut Sticky Rice   Tastes just like the ones offered at Dim Sum places and the coconut sticky rice is warm and delicious     FOR ME ATM and why I m giving it   stars because I m obsessed    I think the last   flavours listed above have an added charge of       or something   Burnt Toffee  Banana Puddin  and Cinnamon Toast  tastes just like the milk after finishing the cereal  are all good but personally  I can only take them in small amounts because it s too sweet for me  Pink lemonade  Fresh Mint  and Genmaicha Matcha   Jasmine soba cha are honorable mentions  Matcha   Jasmine isn t on the favourites because there s little pieces of idk what in it and I m not sure how I feel about it yet   Totaro would definitely be on the favourites list but there was literally a week where I went  x and got   scoops for me and   scoops for my friend  I got a scoop of Totaro every time and honestly  that s just too much  it s taro and coconut or maybe just taro with coconut chunks   I m not huge on chocolate but Rocky Roadkill and Chocolate PB are pretty good   I never understood the ice cream sandwich hype  Do people actually eat as one  It s like impossible to eat together  I like their ginger cookie but I get that separately so the ice cream doesn t ruin the cookie  If you want a cinnamon bun sandwich  they suggest one flavour scoop because the bun doesn t fit two  They will also heat up the cinnamon bun and it s a sour cream icing which I like  I ve never gotten the egg waffle but I have noticed there s a wait  If you do want to try it  I would also suggest getting it separately so the ice cream doesn t ruin the egg waffle  I guess my point is get everything separately  It tastes better on its own    I noticed a lot of people mention a long line and while I ve seen long lines passing by  I ve never actually experienced it and I ve gone on during different days  at different hours  Pretty sure most people are just deciding what to get because they do offer an array of flavours that changes  They do let you try the flavours but I think there is a limit to   per person when the line is long but are more lenient when there s less people  People are nice  never had an issue with any of them  Oh  if you think getting there before it opened means you won t have to line up  that s where you re wrong  The one time I went before it opened  there was already a queue of     people    Don t get Black Tea and London Fog together  I did this   they re very similar but London Fog is better so it s a waste of a flavour,5,2019-04-09
A line up  In the cold  For ice cream    This better be good   we mumbled  The peanut butter and concord grape jelly ice cream   took me to my happy place  We noticed the baker was the same woman from Bakerbots  pumping out cookies left right and centre  We ordered the PB J and banana pudding ice cream in the Hong Kong waffle  Both ice creams were decadent  creamy  and generous with the PB chunks  The waffle was fairly  eggy  in flavour but it worked  So far this is the best ice cream I ve had in the city  Ever  actually  The only thing better for me would be if my ice cream cone came with a puppy ,5,2015-04-29
Came here on a gorgeous    degree day  There was a line  as expected but the wait was quick and was no more than   mins  The lady was really nice and allowed us to taste test a few flavours  I got the London fog and honesty from the hype of this place  I was expecting something very creamy and flavourful  I found the London fog lacking flavour  perhaps it s because earl grey isn t a strong flavour to begin with  and the ice cream just tasted like it came from an average tub you get at the grocery store    The price though  Was very good for the amount of ice cream you get  I was expecting the usual     for a scoop of ice cream like at some other places but was pleasantly surprised here    I ll probably come again to try the flavours and since it s just the beginning of summer imma make sure I get my share of ice cream this season but as for my first impression  it wasn t anything special ,3,2016-06-12
I was excited to try this place because it reputedly has several vegan options  After waiting in line about       mins  I was disappointed to see there were only   vegan ice cream options available that day  vanilla bean and mojito  That said  I chose mojito and it was AWESOME  Fresh  minty  lime y  with a coconut cream base and a hint of real alcohol  Even the two omnivores with me were blown away  The vegan  almost everything  cookie was alright  nothing spectacular  Too bad none of the three cone options were vegan   Overall  I would definitely go back and I would recommend it to friends  both vegan and non vegan    ,4,2017-06-17
You scream I scream we all scream for ice cream     I ordered the matcha ice cream with the waffle cone   They make it fresh  the cone  so it took about    minutes to get it   The ice cream is rich and creamy and the matcha flavour was strong in a good way    Next time I m trying the cookie icecream sandwich  Those looked delish too      Long lineups into a small doorway   They get people through quite efficiently and the lines allow you to decide from the long list of flavours and recommendations ,4,2017-05-13
Oh my  Oh my  I highly recommend the Milk   Cookies ice cream along with the Everything cookie   and a friend of mine made the mistake of getting a half cookie sandwich  big mistake  go for the whole cookie sandwich  Well worth it  amazing ice cream and will make it a stop every time I am in Toronto ,5,2016-07-14
Best ice cream sandwich I ve ever had  I tried the cinnamon toast and peanut butter and jam flavors  The cinnamon toast has a really strong cinnamon taste  but I still prefer the pb and j   it is so creamy  and goes really well with the oatmeal and peanut butter cookies  I do suggest splitting the sandwich with a friend  cookies are huuuuge  Be prepared to wait in line though   this place is popular ,5,2015-07-17
Think I hyped this place up to much for myself  Wasn t mind blown but I might have paired the ice cream and waffles wrong  Ordered the hk waffle with London fog and cinnamon toast ice cream  I tried the London fog ice cream as it s a best seller but if your not a fan of lattes I wouldn t bother  It s really rich in tea flavour  The cinnamon toast ice cream is rich in cinnamon flavour so it was pretty good  The waffle was really well made    My friend ordered the everything cookie with burnt toffee ice cream  It was good  I found there wasn t enough toffee flavour tho but I guess to make the ice cream not too sweet  The cookie was hard as I was expecting it to be soft so it was kinda hard to eat and imo it would taste better with soft cookies    Overall  i noticed these desserts are not too sweet so if you like desserts but don t like them too sweet this is the place for u  The staff is really friendly so the experience was still fun as they help you with flavours and suggestions but this wouldn t be my go to ice cream bar ,3,2014-10-11
great ice cream  great variety and interesting cones ,4,2015-11-19
Ice cream sammies    Creative flavours  quality execution  delicious results     line ups long  can t see easily plan one s order  LOONNGGG lineups ,4,2016-11-10
I ordered a scoop of earl grey ice cream  and it was delicious  There was a pretty long line before we got to order  but it was Sunday in the afternoon  so it was understandable  The ice cream was very rich and creamy  it also had a very distinct earl grey tea taste to it    Although I got a scoop of it  I thought that it was a bit too much  After I got through half of it  I found the taste quite overbearing  My other friends that ordered other flavours  key lime pie  cinnamon and purple yam  also quite enjoyed it  but had the same reaction halfway through  Maybe it was a little too sweet or too rich in taste ,3,2015-08-31
I love their variety of ice cream   This is hands down better than other ice cream joints in Toronto  They actually have GOOD ice cream  not fun decorations  The best part is they have VEGAN options  Bless you bang bang ,5,2016-10-14
Good icecream  I think the sandwich is too big for me to finish before all the icecream melts so I personally think half a sandwich is a good option  If you want more then you can always get one scoop in a cup on the side  I got two scoops in a cup but they are literally directly on top of each other so little wiggle room  I do like how they put the stronger flavor on the bottom to prevent the lighter flavor from being ruined in taste  Two scoops in a cup is       exactly  They have a few benches outside of you don t mind people still in line gawking at you eat    I really like how they understand they need to keep the line moving during weekends and holidays as they do not make hot drinks or offer more than one flavor tasting during these busy times  I think it s worth the line up  but not during weather colder than    degrees Celsius ,4,2016-05-23
One of the best ice cream in town  They always have signature and new flavours    Egg waffles with ice cream is their popular item  Their egg waffles are made to order  I always love the mixed sensation with fresh warm egg waffle with cold ice cream    Their baked goods are provided by their sister store   Bakerbots Bakery  Sweetness level is Canadian standard which is not my liking    The ice cream tastes very natural and not artificial flavours  My favourite signature flavours are   Matcha London Fog Totoro  purple yam   coconut   Recent favourite   Coconut mango pudding with Warm sticky rice  must try item     the sticky rice is on top of the ice cream which is a little messy  but it is well made    Soybean Roasted Walnut   very nutty flavour  It always draws a very long lineup  but totally worth it  ,5,2017-08-19
The best ice cream with a huge variety of flavours that will never bore you no matter how many times you come here  My bf and I each got a half ice cream sandwich so we could maximize our choices    The London Fog ice cream   amazing  A definite must try  And the peanut butter ice cream was also really really good  The ice cream is not just overpriced stuff with a ton of cookie pieces and syrup dripped over it to make tasty   P its real ice cream and its legit ,5,2016-10-16
I don t eat Ice Cream often because it is not good for the waistline and I primarily follow a Paleo diet  But holy crap on a stick  this is the place I will do my cheating at  hands down  There is a reason why they have a huge line up outside the small store front  I was introduced to this place in summer of      and went back   times in a couple months  I can t wait until they open back up  Every cookie is tasty and you can find any combination with ice cream that fits the inner Cookie Monster in you  I have tried the burnt toffee  orange cardamom  halva  vanilla  and chocolate mint  my fav   and all were delish  The service is awesome  Everyone is patient when you are trying flavours to make sure you have the best ice cream experience possible  Be patient with the long lines  make friends and get ready to experience the best dessert has to offer   ,5,2015-02-06
Worth the wait  even on a cold day  The ice creams and cookies are delicious  but more so separately than together  When they re together the cold ice cream makes the cookies a bit too crispy for my liking  I liked the milk   cookies and the chocolate squared ice creams the best ,5,2016-03-21
Everything about Bang Bang is on point   their thick  creamy  and flavourful ice cream  the Hong Kong egg waffle  the hip wooden interior  and the super friendly service  Even on a freezing winter afternoon  they were buzzing with customers    I d recommend the Mud and London Fog ice cream served in a HK egg waffle  However  all the free samples we tried were amazing  so you can t go wrong ,5,2017-03-06
I wish the line ups weren t so long here but it is well worth the wait  They even have completely vegan options  vegan gluten free cookie  and dairy free ice cream  The best part is they don t taste vegan  Mega Bonus  But their other flavours look amazing as well  They change them up frequently so be sure to keep checking back   ,4,2014-11-02
Came here on a Saturday night with a friend and the boyfriend and it was definitely worth the    minute wait we stood in line for   Bang Bang is this cute little shop next to another quirky and super cute little shop called Crywolf  the folks there must have mixed feelings about people standing in line constantly outside their shop  and the lineup is constant   We of course went during the  rush hour of ice cream getting   after dinner   on a weekend  on a hot day   so there were   cards against us     We were all much too full to get any eggies or cookie sandwiches but we did end up getting a cone   single scoop   We had the earl grey  the roasted marshmallow  and the malt teaser   The roasted marshmallow was a bit too sweet for comfort as was the malt teaser but I really enjoy the latter b c of the chocolately chunkiness   The earl grey was by far the best with an awesome lightness to it but strong in the tea flavour     Overall  I would definitely go to Bang Bang s again and I really would love to try the other varieties of flavours they have   and definitely give their egg waffles a try one time ,4,2016-06-16
The egg waffle cone with ice cream is a the perfect match   Tons of interesting ice cream flavours   So far the lychee is my fav ,5,2015-10-19
Holy cow my mouth just had a good bangin    Hard to pick flavors  so many interesting ones  but I am a banana flavor lover so I had to try banana pudding  and burnt toffee seemed to be a good pairing  Instead of the cookie to make a sandwich  I went with the HK style egg waffle cone  which was still warm when it was served to me  That tasted even better than it looked  I was so impressed and was not let down   Crispy outside with chewy eggy insides  the waffle pieces break off into perfect round pieces of heaven  which is a great accompaniment to the sweeter ice cream  Thank God I decided to swing by  it is my favorite food item I have tried here so far ,5,2017-05-17
The massive line up is telling  If you love ice cream  if you don t  you re obviously not human so what use do you have for restaurant reviews anyway     Bang Bang s delivers on all fronts but don t bother if you re in a rush   actually  no  change your plans right now and go anyway ,4,2016-07-28
This place has really unique original flavours  I got the half ice cream sandwich which was pretty filling  I chose the lychee raspberry rosewater one and the pina colada one  Delicious  The everything cookie was bomb too  I tried the espresso one my friend chose which was bomb too if you like a less sweet more bitter flavour   Plus it s in a nice area  Lots of boutiques and shops and restaurants  Nice area to walk around with your bang bang ice cream ,5,2017-09-26
Earl Grey  or London Fog  ice cream on a     everything cookie  Wow  I was so pleased with my choice given how many options there were  The Earl Grey ice cream is not overly sweet which is good because the cookie certainly was  There was also a salty element in the pretzel which was laced through the cookie    Totally worth the   min wait on a hot Spring Saturday ,5,2015-05-05
I have a strong urge to make a reference to Nancy Sinatra s Bang Bang as this place is good  but I wouldn t categorize it as KILLER good   The ice cream s good  and the flavours in constant rotation are awesome so you re bound to see something new featured on the ice cream bin wall displaying the day s feature flavours every time you visit   There are still a few of them that I ve yet to try  but I think my heart s set on Orange Cardamom  London Fog  and Burnt Toffee   One of the downsides for me is lack of sitting space  which means if you don t live in the neighbourhood  you ll have to take it to the sidewalk to finish your ice cream or hop back in your car and try to scarf it down before you make a mess   The bigger downside to me is the price of the baked goods  HK style waffle puffs  which Bang Bang has endearingly named  Puffles   Hogwarts should ve had this as a separate house  for Hufflepuff rejects  are a hefty     a highway robbery level price for anyone who s had these from an Asian mall   For anyone who has yet to try it   imagine a waffle married to bubble wrap  so that there s a bubble in place of every tiny waffled square     I ve personally been yet to be blown away by their baked goods as I find their cookies to be a bit dry  but my friends love them along with the puff choux pastry shell so I may be in the minority   You can pay with credit here  so not to worry if you re devoid of a Macklemore         Even in the colder months or weather  lineups are frequently out the door   Come early to avoid disappointment of finding the labelled bins turned slightly askew  signifying that the popular flavour has been sold out ,3,2015-04-26
If you re not turned off by the long line up  then you re in for a treat    I usually order a half sandwich with the london fog ice cream   I love the versatility of the ice cream flavours   Some unique flavours they have are  ube  Totaro   mango puddin  warm coconut sticky rice  seasonal   and the seasonal bee s knees  chamomile   salted honey    You can choose to have it in a cone  cup  Hong Kong style egg waffle  or a cinnamon bun   If you want to avoid line ups  I would suggest going during a weekday afternoon   Otherwise  if you are greeted by a long line  and are really in a hurry  check out their fridge of pre made sammies and tubs ,4,2016-09-02
Great place  My only issue is the they put the ice cream in the hot waffle  It should be inserted once the waffle cools down a bit to avoid a drippy cone ,3,2016-08-03
This is one of those places where the actual place tastes even better than how the photos look   My boyfriend and I came here on a Wednesday afternoon  so luckily there wasn t a line up or anything  He got the golden Oreo and cinnamon toast in a cup  while I got the lychee rosewater and green tea inside a HK waffle  The ice cream is more  cream  than  ice  so you know you re getting some top tier ice cream   Everything is delicious  and I especially liked how the ice cream melted and soaked the waffle towards the end   like I was eating a green tea waffle   Although it s the middle of fall and winter is coming soon  I will be back for their ice cream   cinnibun sammies soon   ,5,2017-10-30
Long line in the summer but worth that wait  Lots of unique flavors and great cookies for ice cream sandwiches  I wimped our and got matcha tiramisu in a cup ,5,2019-07-13
We noticed a crazy line here last night and then again today  Then we saw they had the waffle ice cream so we decided to try it  We had the waffle with espresso and chocolate  The ice cream was delicious and the waffle was fresh and warm  I didn t think anything was too sweet  just right  Docked a star because the line is a bit ridiculous  Then after waiting a good       minutes in line we had to wait another    minutes for them to make the waffle  Only one waffle maker was working  It s good  but not cheap and for that price I don t think anyone should have to wait that long  Hopefully they improve their processes ,4,2015-10-11
Variety of ice cream flavours a available  You can have scoops of ice cream in cookies or fresh made waffles ,5,2017-10-30
Fun ice cream shop in a great neighborhood  The flavours are unique  Only complaint is they have   waffle maker which keeps the lineup long  Please get some more waffle makers ,4,2016-07-17
A hit or miss  some flavours are good and the others  not so much  Since they only limit you to taste test one flavor  order a flavour that you know you ll like    I liked their oolong tea  taro  hazelnut flavours  but really didn t like their wasabi pea flavour and this other new flavour called something bees    My advice is  after such a long lineup  order something safe and something you know you ll like        stars ,4,2016-06-18
I kept seeing pictures of their waffle cones on Instagram and after going  Bang Bang definitely lived up to the hype  Definitely a     for the atmosphere of the store  quality of the dessert and service  The waffle is just like any regular waffle you can get anywhere HOWEVER  with the combination of their ice cream  it was fantastic  The best part about eating the waffle cone is at the end when you re pretty much done with the ice cream and wishing you had more but then realizing that the waffle has been soaking up the melting ice cream   Their London Fog ice cream is probably one of the best ice creams I ve ever had  The Totaro  taro  was good too  but I ve had good taro flavoured ice cream at other places before  I hear their avocado flavour is another great one to get so I ll probably try it next time I go     The service was great but a little slow  There was only one customer in front of us so we didn t have to wait too long but I can see the waiting times increasing exponentially when there are more people  The server was super nice to us and split our waffle cone into two servings  We didn t know that this was an option until we heard the girls in front of us getting it  Essentially they cut the waffle into two and put each piece into a little cup  you have the choice of putting one full scoop of ice cream in each cup or two half scoops of each flavour  This is great for sharing with your friends or when first trying out their flavours ,5,2016-04-22
Tip  don t want to wait in line  Go on a Tuesday around  pm  The taro was by far my favorite  the key lime pie is also amazing  The PB and J needs more jelly  Had just the scoops and peanut butter cookie ice cream sandwich once  All in all this place is great and love the creativity they put into choosing what flavours to make  I hate lines though so I ll probably only go back if I don t see a line ,4,2015-07-03
This place was amazing  Luckily we got in when the line wasn t too crazy   the flavours are unique but delicious  The Korean waffle cone was amazing as well  Can t wait to go back and try more flavours,5,2015-09-22
This ice cream parlour never disappoints  They have unique ice cream flavours that change seasonally and they make amazing Asian inspired flavours  My personal favourite is their Totoro  which is an unexpected flavoured ice cream and Matcha Tiramisu  which replaces the chocolate in Tiramisu with matcha  But be prepared to wait   on weekends i have waiting upwards of    mins and on weekdays in the summer it can be       mins wait  But soooo worth it  During peak hours they only let you try one flavour per person  which is reasonable to keep the lines moving  I always get the ice cream sandwiches because their cookies are freshly made and delicious  Their bubble waffles are great too except it s a bit of a longer wait  Would definitely recommend you visit here at least once ,5,2019-06-27
OBVIOUSLY bang bang is good have you not heard of Bakerbots    If you come in the summertime make sure you have a fully changed phone or a friend you really like since wait time can be around   mins   My personal favorites are the     London fog     Black tea    Bellwoods stout  more about that later     Bourbon and sanagans bacon  Onto number three  This is the best beer flavoured ice cream in my opinion  Sweet oliknas  or whatever  is bitter and a little icy  Greg s is not flavourful and really icy  it s more like a hard sweet cream slushie  Bakerbots bang bang s has good flavour and is creamy which is difficult to do with beer ice cream as it tends to get icy during the freezing process  They deserve an award or a blowjob,5,2015-02-16
Ice cream is my favourite food and I think I ve tried almost every popular ice cream joint in Toronto  This is the BEST ice cream I ve EVER had  I had the Beer n Brown Bread flavour which sounds gross but tastes amazing  The line was an hour long and it s worth it     My only complaint is that there s pretty much no seating  which sucks after you re sore from all that standing in line  It would be nice to sit and enjoy it ,5,2016-07-15
Worth the hype  The HK waffle is worth coming back for  just time your visit so that there is little to no line   Totaro  london fog  lychee  and burnt toffee are all delicious ,5,2016-10-14
This place was where I first heard of combining both ice cream and egg waffles together  I enjoyed the matcha flavour  but I wouldn t go out of my way to go back here,4,2018-03-24
I got the bubble waffles with earl grey and pink lemonade icecream  Let me just say the pink lemonade icecream was something I ve never had before  in a good way   It wasn t too sweet but had a hint of sourness to it  It was the prefect flavour on a hot summer day  They also have a tone of flavours for you to pick  However  keep in mind that they only have a small bench on the side so if you come during the weekend you ll most likely have to stand while eating  Other than that  I really recommend this place ,4,2017-09-20
SO many flavours   This shop has tons of fun add ons like ice cream sandwiches with cookies cinnamon buns egg waffles   Of course also super instagram worthy   Not only is there multiple flavours to choose from  legit a whole wall   but the flavours are interesting  I ve tried london fog  good but WAY too sweet so I would never get it again  and the bees knees   This was camomile with salted honey   never even seen this combo before in my life   While it was interesting  lots of camomile bits in it too so the texture was not super smooth  I m not so sure I would get this flavour again   The wall of ice cream is constantly changing so you never really know what you are going to get the day you come   I wouldn t trek back here on purpose but if I was in the area I would definitely stop by to see if there s something new I want to try ,3,2017-05-26
Happened on this place by accident  Saw the line and wanted to see what the hype was all about  I got the nutella puff with chocolate ice cream in between  It was amazing   My mom got a   scoop ice cream cone and asked for recommendations  She was given camomile and lavender and lychee and rose i think  Regardless  they were both phenomenal  Flavours I normally wouldn t have picked myself    If I m in the neighbourhood again  I d definitely stop by for more ,5,2018-05-19
This is probably one of my favourite dessert spots  There is always a lineup even in the winter time and for good reason  I ve tried many different flavours  Most recently  I got the Hong Kong waffle cone with two scoops of ice cream  My go to flavour is always the London fog and the other one that I tried for the first time was lychee and raspberry  I would highly recommend both flavours  I ve also tried the bday cookie with ice cream before  It was pretty good as well but the waffle is definitely my favourite ice cream pairing  This place is definitely worth a try ,5,2016-05-31
I debated whether to take off a star because of the frequent long lineups  but being popular isn t actually their fault  Totally delicious ice cream and baked goods  from the basics  chocolate ice cream   birthday cake  cookies  to the ingenious  earl grey ice cream      If you have a low tolerance for lines  best to be strategic when you go ,5,2015-06-21
Bang Bang ice cream is arguably one of the most hot spots in the city for ice cream and dessert right now  and although it is good it is definitely not worth the insane wait times  If you can sneak in to try a cookie sandwich without tapping your toes on Ossington for    minutes i would  but you can get a good if not better scoop of ice cream so many other places in the neighbourhood  I got a cinniebun sandwich with rocky roadkill inside and i had high hopes for the warm and fresh cinnamon roll that ended up being incredibly difficult to eat  making a huge mess of everything while honestly lacking the ooey gooey flavour you would expect  The rocky road ice cream itself was pretty basic but the marshmallows had a good texture and made it enjoyable to eat  My date got the london fog in a ginger cookie and it was delicious if you like strong flavours  Overall the place is certainly over hyped but not a bad place to grab a sweet treat if you can avoid the wait and are really dying to try those Hong Kong waffles ,3,2017-07-19
After seeing all of these ice cream sandwich pictures on social media  I knew I had to try this  Ended up here on a hot Saturday afternoon  There was a long line  as expected  but it moved surprisingly quickly  They clearly have a good system going  The prices were high but not outrageous  I tried the burnt toffee on a Bday cookie sandwich  The ice cream was VERY sweet  which I personally enjoyed  However  the cookie was also VERY sweet  Maybe I should have gone with the everything cookie    so it was a bit of sugar overload  My only complaint was that there was nowhere covered to sit or stand where you could eat your ice cream  It started to rain as we were leaving and we had to find a store awning further down the street to chill out under  But overall  the ice cream was delish  Possibly a bit sweet for some people s taste  but I quite enjoyed it ,4,2017-06-17
Leave room for dessert   no matter where you re dining in the area  This place is an ice cream lover s paradise  The flavours are to die for and the cookies you sandwhich your favorite ice cream are just as sinful ,5,2017-10-15
No seats and long lines but the food made up for it  Relatively cheap  puffs were    with ice cream  ice cream egg waffle was      There was some difficulty making the egg waffle  it looked like mush  and I asked for another one  which they kindly did for me and gave me    back for the inconvenience which was nice of them  They have small stools and benches right outside but it s pretty crowded  Go on weekdays or early weekends for no lines and more seats ,4,2014-08-16
If someone tells you that you can t have ice cream on a cold day  then they ve never had bang bang ice cream  I came here on a cold spring day  it was    degrees outside  and waited in the long line that everyone talks about  but the ice cream was definitely worth the wait  Bang bang has some very unique flavours  of which you can get two scoops in a hot  freshly made waffle eggy cone    Now get this   the waffle acts as a hand warmer on a cold day and you still get to enjoy delicious freshly made ice cream  I found that the ice cream didn t melt too quickly either from being in a hot cone    FLAVOURS  I ve tried multiple flavours over the year but my favourites have to be pink lemonaid and humour me  golden oreo   strawberry   They re both light and fruity  but have hints of real fruit cookie in them    Overall  definitely check out bang bang regardless of the weather  I know i ll be back whether it be a hot summer day or a cold stormy night ,5,2018-03-26
OMG  I thought this place was all hype and I did not go last year   The long lines are really daunting whenever I pass by   However  I was out on a walk and happened to be passing by right as it opens at  pm and got lucky  Oh man  the ice cream here is so delicious   They have amazing flavours  and there are so many options to choose from   You can get the ice cream in a Hong Kong waffle  in a cookie  in a cone  cup or a special of the day like a cinnamon bun    I love that they have adult and children s snack sizes  which is great for my and my baby  I have been back a number of times and my favourite flavour is burnt toffee   I also like the dulce de leche and the taro ,5,2016-06-15
Yum  homemade cookies and ice cream  does it get any better    Get there early though as it gets huge line ups,4,2016-02-03
First visit on a Sunday and it was busy   The line up was about a    minutes   Here it goes   LOCATION North of Ossington about a   minute walk from Queen Street   Nice little shops and restaurants making a great area for dinner and dessert   Small storefront  benches and stools outside     MENU Exciting flavours   How it works  Its a sandwich like dessert    Choose a cookie  puff or Hong Kong waffles as your base and too   The flavours of the cookies are classics with a spin on it   I had the ginger cookie   The puff had a classic and croquette flavour    Ice cream for filling   Too many flavours   avocado  cinnamon toast  Oreo  expresso and more  It all sounds very rich  but it was good for me   I didn t find it too sweet  The coffee is also very good   PRICES Between       for any item   Its is very good value for the uniqueness of their menu   OVERALL I am looking forward to return   Next time will be a dinner and dessert combo ,5,2014-09-30
If this place wasn t so out of the way for me I d go everytime I wanted ice cream  I always get the egg waffles even though its not worth the money and the taro is one of my favourite ,5,2017-06-20
I ve never seen this place without a lineup  but the good news is  it moves quickly     I ve been here twice and both times been very pleased with my selections  I was a little bummed I didn t get to try the waffle this time around  only one machine was working and the wait was about   mins   but their cookies are super tasty  so not too sad   We had     banana pudding       hazelnut ice cream on peanut butter cookies and it was nutty banana perfection   Paying     for an ice cream sandwich would normally seem a little crazy to me  but the portion is HUGE  so perfect for a special treat ,4,2015-08-24
What do I think about bang bang   Bang Bang will save humanity with it s frozen dairy blessings and myriad of ice cream carrying apparatuses   Bang Bang is a shotgun to the palette  The flavors are inventive and delicious  and will have you regretting that you only ordered one cone  The thought of their orange cardamon gives me cold sweats at night as I feverishly dream of my next fix   Vegan Mojito ice cream   Humiliating public boner  I can t create structured thoughts about this place without going weak in the knees  I m sorry ,5,2015-06-11
Been here many times and been thoroughly impressed with each flavour I ve tried  Line up in the summer can look a bit overwhelming  but it moves much quicker than you d think  Staff are friendly and efficient  and they also have a good understanding of which flavours pair well with different cookies which is nice if you re looking to try something unique   A few of my favourites have been the Cinnamon Toast  Peanut Butter w Grape Jelly  real swirls of it   and Burnt Toffee  As far as cookie selection goes  I love the Everything Cookie but you really can t go wrong with any choice here in my opinion  I always make sure to swing by here if I m in the neighbourhood ,5,2016-02-27
I mean with all the different ice cream shops opening up  I gave this one a try on a hot summer day    Was impressed and everything was great including the lychee and rose water ice cream sandwich I got     Might not be worth the price if you go every week  but this is a nice treat every     months  Nevertheless it was good     Pro tip  get a lot of napkins so you don t make too much of a mess   ,4,2016-07-28
Amazing      The line up was long but that s because their ice cream sandwiches are insanely goood     Prepare for your mind to be blown  NUFF SAID,5,2014-08-16
What to try    All their ice cream flavors   Notably the london fog  earl grey  and totaro  taro  are popular flavors    I brought some of my friends here and they loved it too  Usually there s a line here  if there isn t that s not normal  They re known for their awesome flavors and not only can you eat their ice cream  you can pair the ice cream with one of many different cookies they have in house from chocolate chip to everything included cookie  Not only that  you can opt to have it served in their waffles as well which is the egg based waffles or if you like to opt for the traditional cone  you can do that too  Or you can have the ice cream in a pastry puff too    I haven t tried all the flavors but all the flavors I ve had had been great  The ice cream flavors taste like the flavors on the description and sometimes the flavors can also have bits of cookie or toffee bits in them depending on what flavor you get    LAST TIP    Lines are not as long during the winter months so if you don t like lines but still want to try this place  I d say come during the winter time when lines are not as long but the flavors are still there for you to try  You can opt to try one flavor if you want to test it out first and if you like a flavor a lot you can bring a tub and bring it home  You can also buy their cookies frozen too ,5,2017-10-13
The only place I d go for ice cream in the winter  Thee best ice cream shop in all of GTA  Well worth the line up  The ginger cookie is my fave  So many delicious flavours  London Fog  taro  lychee  mint  chocolate    Matcha jasmine  Milk tea  can add tapioca pearls  bubbles boba  for   cents,5,2019-08-06
This place has ridiculous waiting times  I love your ice cream   one of the best I ve ever had  However  every time I even try to go buy some the line is around the block  Why can t there be a more efficient way of serving people    Come on,1,2017-06-05
WOW  WOW  WOW   I won t be able to do this ice cream Sandwiche shop justice but just trust me  if you go to Toronto  you need to find this shop   You will wait    but roll with the  ole adage that good things come to those who wait  We arrived shortly after dinner around    pm on a Sunday eve and there was a line a mile long  We jumped in and waited our turn which came sooner than expected  After about    minutes  we made our way to the counter and with much suggestion by other reviews  we choose to split a Cinnamon Toast  Ginger Cookie Sandwiche  The sandwiches are fairly large so we thought splitting post dinner would be ideal    we were wrong  GET YOUR OWN  Sharing won t be in mind as you tear into this amazing gift from the Ice Cream gods    The only pitfall is with everyone crowded on the sidewalk and no seating inside  you ll find yourself walking and making a mess  I can t wait to hear that one day they ve expanded to a restaurant style seating option ,5,2017-07-01
Bookmarked for months  devoured in minutes  I can t do huge desserts on the regular but when I do  it s a plus if it s exceptional quality   If you re traveling by subway  it s a bit out of your way but closest station is Ossington and then walk a bit    Despite what I originally thought  it s quite a small shop  No space inside to sit but there are a few seats outside so you can enjoy your ice cream on the go or outside     Flavor wise  it is VERY diverse  We wanted to get a cookie sandwich  you have the option of getting a full sandwich or half a sandwich  each    or     respectively   I think   So we decided to go full out and get the full cookie sandwich  Thanks to the patience of the employee  we were able to pick exactly what we wanted  with two ice cream samples    You can also choose to have two different types of cookies and ice cream flavours to make your sandwich    My order  cookies  RoCocoa and an oath peanut butter cookie   can t remember the exact name  and ice cream flavours  London fog   earl grey   and Peanut Butter and Concord grape Jelly   DELICIOUS   I especially recommend that second ice cream flavor  The whole sandwich was sooooo good but we soon learned that maybe half a sandwich would ve been enough haha    Alas  I definitely recommend you check it out      PS they only take cash or credit  no debit  ,5,2015-07-24
LOVE this place   Came here for our second go at trying to avoid their famous lineup  on the Jay s opening night when it was snowy   genius   Waited about   min and was greeted with pleasant service   I ordered their vegan almost everything cookie with tetaro ice cream  and he had their oatmeal cookie with PB J ice cream   Both were super yummy and portions were generous  even for the half cookie size     There are tons of ice cream flavours as well as different pastries for you to have your ice cream with   can t wait to come back soon to try another combo ,5,2016-05-01
Always love coming to bang bang one of my favourite places to go for ice cream  You always feel so welcomed which I love and their ice cream flavours are unique and to die for    You can usually taste more then one sample if it isn t busy but if it is only one is allowed nonetheless it s so worth   Got the birthday cake cookie dough today and it s absolutely tasted delicious   One of my all time favourite is totaro which it s taro would totally recommend it,5,2018-04-01
After many years  this place is still one of the better ice cream shops  this and Kekou are my favourites   Lineups are still pretty intense in the summer   I always always get the Cinnamon toast in a cup  I ve had it in a cookie before but that was way too filling   still damn good  but feel like death after  No amount of running can get rid of that lol  The pricing here is fair      bucks for a scoop and add more for egg waffles  cookies  etc  You ll spend under     for sure though  for some wicked ice cream   You can sample some of the flavours but honestly   sometime the best thing to do is to gamble in life and order any ice cream  try it  if it doesnt t taste good to you  order more  Always room for more ice cream   Bang Bang does a great job at getting customers in and out quick  and I have never had any issues with their service  or their food ,5,2019-06-28
This is probably my favorite ice cream shop in TO  A large selection of hand made and creative flavors   and the bubble waffles  Ugh  Don t mind if I do ,5,2016-11-19
You can t get better ice cream sandwiches than from Bang Bang  They offer so many delicious flavours that it s very hard to decide what to get  I recommend the Sam James coffee flavour and their chocolate ice cream  I also usually get the everything cookie when I get their ice cream sandwiches  Getting half a cookie sandwich is just the amount to get  If you want to treat yourself you should get a full cookie sandwich  The advantage of getting the full cookie sandwich is that you can choose two different ice cream flavours to put inside your sandwich  I will definitely come here again   Beware of their long lines   A typical wait is       minutes  Also if you love their ice cream and can t live without it  they sell pints of ice cream ,5,2016-07-03
The line up plus making ice cream in small batches added to the appeal of this place  I got the Big Waffle which comes with   ice cream favours  I got burnt toffee and fresh mint  The waffle is made fresh so I had to wait a good      minutes  The place is small so people were constantly running into each other  There is no seating inside or out on the patio  The waffle finally arrived and it is was insta gram worthy  When I took a bite   it was hard and overdone  The ice cream were good nothing extraordinary  Overall  I appreciate all the combinations and flavours this place has to offer  But the quality could use some work ,2,2018-08-04
Visited Fri May   in the afternoon  I hate lineups  so waiting       min for food is already a turn off  The flavours of ice cream are definitely unique and creative  a huge reason to come    It was tough see and figure out what the flavours were available since their menu is a bunch of tin cans on the wall  Their menu is fairly simple but I don t remember what the prices were  You can get a whole cookie  half a cookie or a waffle  I think I got Taro and a Caramel which were both amazing    I wouldn t come back again unless there is no line up ,4,2015-06-29
Cookies and ice cream for dessert  what not to like    It s pretty big tho so went splitsy with my beau  otherwise too much for my usually overeaten stomach  firstworldproblem,4,2014-11-29
I don t like lining up   But I knew what I was in for   The line up  from joining the line to having ice cream in hand  was about    minutes  give or take a few seconds     Lots of ice cream selections that sounded appealing   Definitely opt for two or three free samples   otherwise you might settle on a huge wallop of a flavour you don t like   I m still confused about the ordering options   when we reached the front of the line  the guy serving us said we could get two or three flavours in a whole cookie  with each cookie being different  so top and bottom of the sandwich could be a different cookie   that part made sense to me  but we sort of got confused   I wanted PB J  my friend wanted chocolate hazelnut  and he ended up smooshing them together in two different cookies   confusing   I didn t like either cookies  everything cookie or the chocolate salted one  but I would go back and just get ice cream in a cup   I loved the PB J   obviously  since I chose it   but I didn t want chocolate hazelnut and was sad that it was part of my cookie sandwich   So go  and don t get confused  just stick to your guns and order what you ve spent the past    minutes deciding you were going to have   Gluten free flavours available  in both ice cream and cookie   Also   why is it       including tax  What s the one cent about ,3,2014-08-16
The lineup is hella long   most likely because the choices are endless  I actually quite liked this place despite people saying it is overly hyped  My go to is definitely the earl grey ice cream   freaking delicious  Quite pricey  but you gotta treat yourself once in a while ,4,2019-09-04
By far the best ice cream spot in Toronto  I had the chocolate chip cookie   Reece s pieces ice cream sandwich  It didn t last   seconds before I inhaled it  Usually has a line but the line runs very quickly  I highly recommend you try this place  It s a must ,5,2019-08-01
Favourite place for in house made ice cream  My favourite one is the lychee in rose water  Super creative nomenclature  Lots of options ,5,2018-09-24
We waited in line for about    minutes and it was totally worth the wait  You will not be disappointed  The mango pudding with sticky rice is delicious  I got the vegan one with a gf vegan blueberry cookie   Sammie  Yum ,5,2018-06-02
I ve been wanting to come here for a long long time and the visit was extremely overdue  We went for ice cream on a snowy and windy day in May  Because   Canada  Ice cream is always a good idea  Anyway  glad we chose to go that day because there was essentially no line up  which I don t think would be usual for a Sunday afternoon in May  I got the earl grey and cinnamon toast   both amazing flavours  Some good vegan options too    the waffle does take a long time  so if you don t want to wait too long  I d suggest going with the other options  cone  cookie  etc   The location is a little too far west for me  but will definitely be going back during the summer ,5,2016-05-17
Good ice cream  found nothing really special about it so I don t think that queuing around    minutes is worth  They don t have a seats  which is a very important fixtures  There s no place for me to enjoy the ice cream except sitting outside beside the garbage ,3,2015-05-04
Absolute best HK waffle ice cream treat I ve had outside Hong Kong  The ice cream flavors are amazing and creative  the mango sticky rice is ridiculously good   The waffle is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and cradles the smooth and creamy ice cream beautifully like a loving mother  We luckily got to the shop right before a rain storm so the line was minimal but I ve heard crazy stories about lines stretching as far as the eye can see  so plan accordingly   Enjoy ,5,2018-07-03
Went here because of the high rating  Walked for   min to get there and weather was really hot  Waited in line for   min and thought it better be worthed  Finally my turn came and i ordered burnt toffee with the puff It is DEFINITELY worthed   If only i have more  space  in my stomach  i d have ordered more  Well  there s always next time  With the store is being crowded  i m sure it won t go anywhere  The only not so good experience i had was  the service  The store has regular puff or nutella chocolate puff  They should have advised customer about the different puff types  I wasn t aware about this and was given the regular puff  If i had known earlier  i d get the nutella puff  yum  love nutella   ,4,2018-05-29
Unique experience  This place is definitely worth visiting  We ordered an ice cream in a waffle and it was amazing  The waffle was light and fluffy and complimented very well the sugar in the ice cream  My two ice cream flavours were London Fog and Banana Pudding  The London Fog tasted truly like a an Earl Grey tea and the best part was the fact that they use Harney   Sons Fine Teas to make the flavour  We ll be definitely back for more    stars ,5,2016-08-25
Not worth the time to line up and certainly not worth the price  I am better of grabbing a tin from the grocery store,2,2016-10-01
Sold out of my goto choice  but the ice cream was delish   Line up was worth the wait    ,4,2017-10-03
Pros    Great tasting ice cream   Tons of unique flavours and combinations to chose from   Everything tasted fresh for the most part  Cons    The line can be brutal during peak hours   Ice cream can melt if pay line is slow   Finding parking can be difficult  Ordered  Double scoop of Hazelnut and London Fog Waffle cone of Tortaro and Burnt Toffee  Conclusion  I overall enjoyed my experience at Bang Bang  We got there at around        afternoon on a Saturday and the line wasn t too long which was nice  The ice cream was super tasty with lots of options to chose from  I ordered two scoops of the hazelnut and london fog which was great  The hazelnut was a tad sweet but still great  The london fog was a strong tea flavour was I really enjoyed  We also got the waffle cone with tortaro flavour and the burnt toffee which was also great  I would definitely recommend Bang Bang if the line isn t too brutal ,4,2017-06-18
I got a scoop of London fog and burnt toffee ice cream in a Hong Kong waffle and it was phenomenal   The London fog and burnt toffee ice cream compliments the slightly sweet Hong Kong waffle so well  The Hong Kong waffle is slightly crispy on the outside and they make it on the spot so it s warm and fresh  I loved the burnt toffee ice cream which had pieces of toffee inside  Even though my friends and I had to wait for    minutes  the time flew by while we were trying to figure out what to get  This place has so many different and original flavours  Definitely one of my favorite ice cream places ,5,2015-10-17
HOLY CRAP    I ve had good ice cream before but then Bang Bang blew me away  no pun intended   I had the Hong Kong waffle wrapped with the macha green tea ice cream as well as the London Fog ice cream   As I said before  HOLY CRAP   That London Fog blew me away   Every taste felt like heaven in my mouth  My Fiance had the Malteser ice cream  different name but I can t remember at the moment and again divine   These guys know ice cream   We were lucky enough to go in the evening in the fall when people don t usually want ice cream but as good as it is  I would be frustrated with waiting over an hour for ice cream ,5,2015-12-21
Iced cream is iced cream  I can t bring myself to wait in the    minute line up  so it s been a while since I ve had it  I m not sure the novelty of getting to choose your cookies and iced cream is worth it  but the Sam James espresso and puff pastries sure are yummy   if you re willing to wait ,4,2015-07-04
The wait was surprisingly very short for a beautiful long weekend Saturday afternoon   We waited about    minutes in line until we placed our order   They have so many unique flavours sometimes it s hard to decide   However  I like anything coffee flavoured  so I got a sample of the espresso ice cream and I was sold   I thought I wanted a bubble waffle  but when my friend said that it is harder than the way they make it at Pacific Mall  I decided to just go with the half cookie   I ve been here about     times and ALWAYS get the cookie   Maybe I just play it safe   I got the espresso ice cream with the almost everything vegan cookie   The cookie was great with the ice cream and did not get hard at all  the way cookies get when they touch ice cream   My friend got the waffle with the ube ice cream   Unfortunately my friend had to wait a fair amount of time for his waffle to be cooked   I finished my whole half cookie by the time he got his  awkward sentence    I tried one of the bubbles from his waffle and I was so happy I didn t get it   It was over cooked and crunchy   Maybe they have to make it like this so it s easier to hold or so the ice cream won t melt through right away  but I was not a fan   I m used to it being soft and fluffy  like an actual waffle   Will obviously return if I m in the area because their flavours are so good   London Fog is another one of my favourites   I ve also tried their beer flavoured ice cream and it surprisingly works ,4,2016-07-04
Delicious ice cream sandwich  I love the fact that you can get half  Came here on a Tuesday evening around      and there was a big crowd there  The wait wasn t too bad  Service was friendly and pretty quick  I really enjoy the London fog and Taro flavors with chocolate cookies ,4,2018-09-26
Went here on at      on a cold night  Despite the weather  me and my friends decided to wait in the line up  which was out the the door  but moved quick enough  for a new ice cream experience  After we each ordered our ice cream  it was clear the wait was worth it  I really enjoyed my vanilla bean ice cream sandwiched between half a ginger cookie  As well  my friends enjoyed their choices as well  My only complaint  I wish the cookie pastry would be softer so the food is easier to eat  they are messy treats  but delicious indeed  and I wish there was more space from the sidewalk to the building  this would ve prevented me from tripping on my way out from getting my food haha   Overall  this place is great ,5,2014-08-16
I m giving it   stars because I m a big ice cream fan  Unfortunately  this was not as good as I thought it would be  I waited for   and a half hour hoping that I d get a taste of creamy and rich ice cream  Flavours were alright and some of them were unique and enticing   Fig with goat cheese and honey  miso and cherry  These sounded really interested  and they were alright  However  I really did expect more  Compared to some of the ice cream I ve tasted  Cows  Kem Coba  etc etc  this isn t really that special  I appreciate the effort with the flavours and the egg waffle    but to wait an almost two hours for not so special ice cream    meh ,2,2015-07-20
Green Tea Ice Cream  superb  ginger cookie  just okay  Loved the way it was served as a half ice cream sandwich  The line outside was evidence something exciting was going on inside  A bit chaotic to get in and out but that s part of the experience I think  Also  nowhere to sit and enjoy the sugar rush  All of the employees though under pressure were very kind  Enjoyed as a tourist to Toronto ,5,2017-09-12
I have late night bang bang  toasted marshmallow  cravings  Some of their ice cream flavours include  thank you very matcha  burnt toffee  birthday cake  beer and bacon  and my fav   toasted marshmallow  hehe they have a whole wall so you ll find what you need  The cookies are soooo chewy and crazy  They make ice cream sammiches out of cookies  Japanese bubbly waffles    Nutella profiteroles  The line up is usually long so be prepared but it s well worth it  Also try to go early cause flavours are made fresh and run out towards the end of the night   Seriously love this place   also have a massive crush on one of the angsty server guys who s all tatted up and hilarious  Hehe,5,2016-01-21
Not my first time here and it won t be my last  We got here early evening on a Sunday and it wasn t too bad of a wait  But when summer rolls around  be prepared to wait  I really enjoyed the totaro  avocado and the lychee rose water  I d highly recommend  They also offer honk long waffle cones and cookie sandwiches but I find those hard to eat before the ice cream melts ,5,2018-06-13
I don t understand the hype    The ice cream taste good but not the cookie   Also I don t think it s worth the wait ,3,2016-11-15
amazing icecream   service  I just wish there were no lineups,4,2015-10-28
Amazing flavors  Came here during summer a couple times and the wait was never that bad if you went during a weekday  Great place to bring friends when they visit Toronto  The sandwiches are amazing as well  Wish it was slightly cheaper but that s the popularity tax I suppose ,5,2016-01-08
I had the Lychee Raspberry  with rosewater    Yum  I have also found Taro  They have more flavours  They did not have waffles that day     Clearly I will have to go back ,4,2016-06-15
If I m looking for delicious  quality ice cream with lots of options for  carrying vessels   I go to Bang Bang  There is always a lineup outside the door but thankfully on our last visit  it moved quickly  They limit ice cream testing to a few flavours during busy periods  I love that you can choose to have your ice cream in one of several cookie sandwiches  or half sandwiches   Hong Kong style bubble waffles  cream puffs  waffle cones  or cups    The ice cream flavour choice is expansive  with options posted on the front of canisters on the wall  Their ice cream is creamy and has that resistance to bite chew that I look for in a quality ice cream  My go to flavour is the London Fog  earl grey   but the Totaro  ube taro purple yam with coconut  is one of the best I ve had  Their ginger milk ice cream is a definite must try if you love the heat of ginger    Despite the distance for me to get there  hubby and I will definitely be back ,4,2016-07-16
I waited about a half hour for this  I unfortunately could not eat the hk waffle cone or the cookie  but the vegan ice cream was pretty good  Because the wait was so long  I could only taste one flavor  I got the mojito and pina colada and they were coconut based  It was deliciously creamy and flavorful ,4,2016-07-27
i don t understand the hype   ok ice cream  ok cookies  terribly inefficient service  which is why there is a lineup   if they are doing that on purpose to generate hype  I guess it works because in the warmer weather  the line can get ridiculous long   i d go again  if there wasn t a lineup  but i d rather eat ice cream at Sweet Olenka s ,2,2015-11-20
Excellent egg waffle cone   Sampled the vegan mojito sorbet and it was very flavourful and refreshing   It s got a tint of alcohol that brings us memories of our favourite summertime drink   Probably won t work if you re looking to combine it with a cookie or egg waffle  but a great stand alone treat ,5,2018-03-18
I tried the waffle cone this time  After you wait in line and place your order for the waffle cone it s another wait because they only have to Waffle machines so it was a really long wait however the waffle was really good and the ice cream is so creamy that I forgot all about the long wait,5,2018-08-06
After all the hype  my boyfriend and I finally decided to try this place   We got the rocky roadkill and chestnut matcha with the HK egg waffles  We ended up waiting an hour  and an additional    mins because they only had ONE waffle maker  The customer service was slow  which may have added to the wait time    The rockyroad had applewood smoked almonds which had great taste and crunch  But besides that  the chocolate flavour was average  The chestnut matcha fell short in the flavour category  It was super bland  so for all the matcha lovers out there  I d recommend trying another flavour before being disappointed by this one  The waffles were okay  but the ones at Chinatown or Pacific Mall are better  One bonus is that they offer vegan ice cream  but besides that I don t think it s anything worth waiting for    Overall I d give this place      If the owners managers are reading this  a suggestion or two      Get a second waffle maker  due to the high volume of waffle orders    or have an employee warn everyone in line about the extra wait time for waffles      Have an employee start taking orders from all the patient customers waiting outside the door so that you guys can prepare better for the rush ,3,2015-05-25
Love this place  great ice cream treats and variety  Whenever I am in the area it is my guilty pleasure ,4,2016-06-15
Been here a couple of times  Line ups are the norm and are slow due to the care they provide to each and every customer  so be prepared to wait and watch everyone before you come out with delicious creations  My fave is the earl grey ice cream wrapped in a cone made from a hong kong waffle  looks like bubble wrap   they also do half sized cookie ice cream sandwiches which is awesome since not everyone can eat two cookies and a slab of ice cream in one sitting  despite trying   No where to sit inside so if it s cold out  bring gloves  Worth it  Also  captain crunch ice cream ,4,2015-10-30
TLDR  I am in love with this place  Seriously go  Customer service needs a little work though   My friend and I decided to check this place out since we were nearby so   why not   They open in the evening and definitely expect a line up when you go  although the line moves fairly quickly  The list of the ice cream flavours can be seen on the wall as well as the list of all the different cookies other yummy baked goods they have to offer   They sell half ice cream sandwiches or a whole one but we decided to go for the whole and split it in half that way so we can get more for our money   We ordered a ice cream cookie sandwich which consists of   TOP COOKIE   Gingerrrr BOTTOM COOKIE  Everything Cookie ICE CREAM  Half of the London Fog and half of the Birthday Cake Cookie Dough   Let me tell you  that was one of the best god damn ice cream sandwiches that I ve had so far and one of the creamiest and tastiest London fog ice cream ever   Whenever you get the chance definitely hit up this place  it ll be so worth it  although I found the customer service to be lacking  the ice cream sandwiches make up for it ,5,2014-06-17
Got the pb j because of a tip from someone on yelp     Awesome choice   But i also had a taste of my friend s London fog which tastes awesome too   The only reason why i gave   stars instead of   is because the staff seem miserable and don t even smile   It s ice cream   Everyone should be happy ,4,2014-10-26
Totally worth the wait    Came here on a late Sunday afternoon and the line was literally down the street  The wait was probably a good half hour to    minutes until I got to order and then another    minutes to get my order  bc I got the Hong Kong waffle     to be exact   Upon getting up to the door  I noticed they have tons of flavor   what to chose  what to chose  I debated on a few but then settled for Lychee Raspberry and London Fog  My husband got the Rocky Road  and we ordered   waffles by itself   I think the might need to invest in more waffle makers bc they only have    With a line that is always out the door  that s a problem  Bc I ordered    the people behind me had to wait even longer if they wanted an egg waffle  Moving on   the ice cream is AMAZING  So light yet so rich  It was so creamy  Normally    scoops would be plenty  but after finishing it  I wanted more  If the line wasn t so long  I would have definitely went back and indulged in some more  My husband Rocky Road was awesome  My son hogged a whole scoop to himself and my husband felt that his one scoop was not enough as well  Yes  it s that delicious   If you are in Toronto  definitely come check out this place  However  brace yourself as you may be waiting a long long time ,4,2017-05-03
The ice cream was awesome  you could tell it was made fresh  Also had the puffle waffle cone  hong kong waffle  and was delicious  The combo was amazing  I had the banana puddin and the fresh mint ice cream  and boy was that mint fresh  I had to knock off a star because of the waiting  I don t normally mind a long line for something  but in this case the wait wasn t so much because of the line  The workers seemed a little slow  That really surprised me because it seemed like this place has been open for a while  you would think they would be more streamlined  Also  they were haven t some issues with the puffle griddle  Seemed a lot more people would order it if they didn t have to wait an extra five minutes because the waffle sticks to the griddle and they have to re do it often  It s quite delicious  I feel if they could figure out how to streamline it  they totally deserve   stars because it is great ice cream ,4,2015-07-27
Coming here after a soccer match  Jen decided to take me here   A popular place along Ossington  Bang Bang ice cream offers a range of creative ice cream flavors for the adventurous type   Keep in mind during the summer months  wait times can be quite long  much like waiting for a ride at a theme park  After waiting in line for    minutes we finally got served   Jennifer got the Toasted cinnamon with ginger cookie   Ice cream sandwich  which I must say was a delish mouthful of flavors  Burnt toffee with captain crunch  being a fan of toffee  caramel  etc this was a no brainer for me  Their service is fast  friendly and efficient which makes this place popular   Bang Bang is an easy    ,4,2017-08-29
While not mind blowing  this place always hits the spot for me  Whenever I m in the area  I seize the opportunity and come  I guess I ve been lucky to drop by at quieter times as I ve never waited more then    to    mins  Although the presentation isn t as impressive as Sweet Jesus  I would choose Bang Bang any day for the fact that they    make their own ice cream  and it s delicious     offer a larger variety of flavors and combinations  cookies  waffles  cream puffs  macarons  and    have very unique flavors   On my last visit  I had the HK egg waffles with the Totaro and their seasonal Love Oolong Time icecream  The HK egg waffles were admittedly not that great  A bit too much batter which made it too thick and overly chewy  I wouldn t get this again  I did however  absolutely LOVE the oolong ice cream  Subtle flavor in comparison to the taro but both tasted just like the real thing  So so good  Here s hoping the oolong stays on the menu    They re known for their icecream sandwiches so I d recommend ordering this if it s your first time  Can t go wrong with any of the cookies but The Everything is your best bet  There hasn t been an ice cream flavor I ve tried that I didn t like  London Fog  Rocky Roadkill  Vanilla Bean  pb chocolate and a few others  so just go with whatever your heart desires ,4,2016-03-31
This place always has a line up  If you re planning to go during the summer  expect to wait at least    minutes  I m sure you ve seen it on some lists like Narcity or BlogTO  That s what brought me here as well  They do have very good homemade ice cream and cookies  But  it s not better than places like Bakersbot  Ossingston Station   If you are a person who NEEDS to try well reviewed  trendy hot spots than you should try it  I recommend the burnt toffee with everything cookie  For pics  the waffle cone is a must  If you re not a chronic IGer or a foodie  than you re better off trying any other lesser known  homemade  ice cream and bakeries ,4,2018-07-08
Delicious ice cream nestled in a fresh baked cookie  Huge lines tell the tale  Visit and enjoy ,4,2017-07-19
One word   hipsters     I was warned the lineups are crazy  but i wanted to hop on the newest toronto food fad     Like uncle tetsu  and krispy kreme when they first opened  we love our linea   bang bang did not dissapoint   We arrived at      and did not get served until          Kudos for the different flavours   The hk waffle is a unique item   It was late and i didnt want to eat that so late in the night   I noticed the hk waffle is made to order and a cone is placed inside to hold the ice cream   I thought the asian flavors and offerings reflected the owners asian background  but theyre not asian   Would like to come back again but they say the line ups are throughout the day   Doubt i will be back soon ,3,2016-06-01
Waffle cone ice cream  YUMMY    If your in the hood or within    mins of walking distance  you really need to check it out   I live far from the location like over an hour on transit and with the waiting I didn t feel like it was worth the mission   However if I am near there  I will be there with my money  Just take my money please   Wish they had sitting   ,4,2017-06-18
Arrival   Long line at   PM on a Saturday night   That  to me  is a good sign   Ordering   Some flavours available  some not  but lots to choose from   Elected to get the Cinnamon Toast Crunch ice cream on a     everything cookie   Tasting encouraged and taken advantage of   Consumption   Very tasty and creamy   everything ice cream should be   Cookies were delicious and chewy     Overall   Yeah  I m going back for more   My only regret is that they didn t have their bacon ice cream available  apparently it s an every now and then kind of thing   ,5,2014-07-28
This place definitely deserves all the attention it s been getting  A must try for anyone who likes ice cream  and  really  who doesn t like ice cream      What really sets this place apart from all your regular ice cream shops was the home made  made to order waffle thing they have  It offers the perfect  stage  for all the extraordinary  interesting  fun  and plain weird  in the best possible way  ice cream flavors to shine  Perfect combo  Beware tho  it s highly addictive and if you try it once  you most likely are gonna find yourself going back for more every chance you get ,5,2016-08-26
Probably my favourite ice cream place in the city  Tortaro is a must try and don t forget to get it in a waffle cone ,5,2017-11-07
Pros   The ice cream here is great  The cookie and waffle options make it better  Go    Cons   The line is slow  but it isn t Bang Bang s staff  It is the people who go in and seem to forget what ice cream is  Taking   minutes to pick a sample after being in line near the menu for    minutes  Then you have those idiots who get their order and stand right there in this    x    ft space  GTFO    They should put a sign up telling people to please clear out after you have your order because sheep aren t able to herd themselves ,4,2015-09-10
The lineup wasn t too bad today considering the weather was so nice  Maybe I just got lucky  I tried the fresh mint ice cream with chocolate chips inside  Wow it was such a different and interesting taste experience and tasted so fresh and I had it on a simple cone without any cookies for     Well worth it,4,2015-07-05
This place is a hot mess  The ice cream is fine  you ve had this ice cream before  it won t be the best ice cream you ve ever had and it won t be the worst ice cream you ve ever had and it definitely won t change your life  The interior is pinteresting enough and the rows of matching canisters are twee  The overall execution is terrible  No seating on the inside unless you want to chance it with the two stools up for bid  Zero air circulation  Be prepared for a substantial wait in a small  stifling room that is chock full of people who bought into the Bang Bang hype  Look forward to patrons who decide to be extra precious and sample   or   flavors  choosing them one at a time and slowly and deliberately  The staff does nothing to coax the process along despite an obvious pile up of customers they are intentionally bottle necking  The cookies ensconcing the ice cream sandwich are mediocre at best  not particularly flavorful  chocolate y chippy or complementary to whatever flavor you re choosing  Certainly not a cookie you would elect to eat on a standalone basis  The ice cream is rubbery and melts inordinately fast  particularly in humid temps  quickly devolving into an inedible mess  Threw my sandwich away after   or   bites  Disgusting  Hong Kong waffle cone does not compare to the real mcCoy  All around disappointment to myself and other members of my party  Skip it  there are worthier ice cream stands in the city ,1,2015-07-21
Long lineups but worth the wait  Cookies are fantastic and ice cream flavours are uniquely delicious  Probably not an everyday go to    so maybe every other day ,5,2015-10-12
Heads up germaphobes  the employees making your food don t wear gloves    I saw the dude rolling up a bubble waffle for the waffle cone and he was shaping it by hand so i asked the cashier like   hey do you guys wear gloves    to which she informed they do not  they wash their hands  Okay    she then whispered to the waffle cone guy and he went and washed his hands  helped some customers  and then made my waffle cone  I know this happens a lot in restaurant kitchens  but at least then as customers we don t have to see it or think about it  Would love for this place to adopt wearing gloves as it would make me way more comfortable ,3,2018-03-17
Bang bang is the shit the locals know it   London fog with Nutella puff you can t go wrong with it   tataro with anything the gang knows it s the sh t     stars too short cuz this joint is level    lit,5,2018-09-08
Got the Totaro and Sourpop ice cream with the egg waffle   Ice cream was really good  especially the Totaro   Sourpop ice cream really tasted like Guanabana   Ice cream was the best part but you get so little of it   Two small scoops  for essentially     meh  try it and move on   Egg waffle  been eating this since I was a child so it s nothing new   they take the waffle off the machine too quickly as the outside is suppose to be crispy but instead its spongy   Long line up  worth the wait but just the first time ,3,2017-09-11
Me and my friends decided to give this place a try after reading all the great reviews  Was it worth the hype  No  Was it worth waiting in line for    minutes  No  Was the food good  I guess  I had a scoop of the matcha and a scoop of the malteaser ice cream in a waffle cone for     I thought the food would be way better than it actually was judging by the line outside  It didn t taste any special from other ice cream I ve had and the other thing that made it stand out was the waffle cone  The employees were nice but they worked pretty slow and I waited at least ten minutes for my order  The shop itself is petite but very cute  the only thing about this place that stood out to me  This place would be nice to go to I d you re in the area but it s not worth a long commute  Overall  okay but would not try again ,3,2015-07-20
 Bang bang into the room  I know you want it  Bang bang all over you  I ll let you have it  Yo  I said    Bang bang  Bang bang   bang bang     Nicki Minaj  Thanks for capturing my thoughts about Bang Bang perfectly Nicki  I couldn t have said it any more eloquently    Hong Kong Waffle        Similar to my sentiments about wine and peanut butter   jelly sandwiches  egg puffs are a food item that I don t really enjoy  Yet  always take a bite when offered   in hopes that I will like them more than I did before  finally understand why the rest of the world is so in love with them  and basically assimilate as a normal part of society  I mean  I get it  They smell sweet and creamy  They look super cute and fluffy  Yet  I just always find them really bland  Thanks to Bang Bang for adding ice cream to the mix  because I now have a newfound appreciation for them  The clock s ticking  P Mall  Step up your game  We picked two flavours of ice cream to go with it  description below   Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich        Macaron flavour of the day was Chocolate  It is much chewier than your average macaron  making it extra fun to eat with the ice cream    Favourite ice cream flavours  in order      London fog  According to the super friendly staff that worked there  Hazelnut Chocolate or London Fog pairs goes well with the macaron  FUN FACT of the day time  London Fog is actually based on Earl Grey tea and originated in Vancouver  BC  What  This was delicious and   points for the unique flava  Good for those that prefer a more mild flavour  not too sweet but still creamy       Halva  black and white Sesame  Also very unique      Pumpkin Spice  The basic girl in me was so excited for this flavour  It certainly lived up to expectations       Avocada  Like an avocado smoothie you get from pho but in ice cream form      Corn on the Cob  Sweet and creamy   Bang on  Bang Bang ,4,2014-09-28
Came here after a girls night out activity  We arrived at   pm to find a sizeable lineup that quickly grew behind us  Took us about    minutes to get in  As we neared the door I could smell the delicious aroma of fresh baked cookies  yum  I got the half ice cream sandwich with everything cookie and chocolate squared ice cream  Pretty good  I like that the ice cream and cookies aren t super sweet  My friends both got a half ice cream sandwich as well  one got an everything cookie with rocky roadkill and another got the birthday cookie with burnt toffee  I sampled both and they were pretty yummy  Overall  worth the wait and will be back ,4,2015-06-17
Summer time   ice cream time  I d say even with all the ice cream shops popping up over the city with the gimmicks and different cones   bang bang is up there with its quality of ice cream and the constantly updating ice cream flavour roster  This time around  got an ice cream sandwich with the matcha tiramisu and the boba papa milk tea  Those flavours were delicious   The matcha tiramisu had that nice cakey texture to part of it  and the milk tea tasted just like bubble tea  I got the everything cookie as I usually do   picked both cookies as the everything cookie but next time I might venture off and try the oatmeal raisin or smth ,4,2019-08-27
The reviews online are true  The ice cream is smooth and flavorful  I got a half ice cream sandwich with key lime pie ice cream and a ginger cookie  My husband got fudge ice cream and a peanut butter cookie  Although the line was long  the service was fast and staff were friendly  My only complaint was that it was difficult to eat it as a sandwich bc the ice cream stuck to the wax paper  but otherwise it was gr  ,4,2018-06-23
I came here for the first time and must say I absolutely loved the ice cream  I got there a few minutes before open to avoid the line  and we were served very quickly  My recommendations  vegan raspberry sorbet  pink lemonade  and the cinnamon toast flavours  the birthday cake flavour was okay  too    My only critique would be that the staff was very rushed because of the line up and noise from the crowd  so asking questions was a bit difficult ,5,2018-06-06
Probably my favourite ice cream place downtown  once I discovered this place I ve been wanting to go back every time  Like everytime I want ice cream I go BANG BANGhahahaha ok kinda reminds me of big bang theory except this theory is now A FACT that its ice cream is amazing  youre welcome  So when I first encountered this place I didn t even know where it was because there was a hecka long line and the line was covering the entrance  I kinda just joined the line because you know somethings good when people line up for it so it was kind of a nice surprise  Then I looked up this place on Yelp and realized they have egg waffle and ice cream  I quickly ordered the egg waffle with the   flavours of cinnamon toast and milk and cookies  I highly recommend these   flavours    I didn t expect much but it definitely then exceeded the expectations I wouldve even had haha  I ll focus on the egg waffle because that is the most BANGING part of the dessert  Don t get me wrong as the ice cream was rly good too like definitely get it  but as a Chinese person who has basically lived my entire life eating egg waffles  this place does not disappoint  So trust me on this one guys  its amazing   The reason I didn t give a full   stars is because the desserts are kind of pricy but again the quality is amazing so I don t mind paying for it  I urge you to check out this place  I m sure there are even more flavours and types of desserts that are just as delicious as their ice cream and egg waffle   bang bang im out,4,2018-06-04
Got the chocolate ice cream in a bubbly waffle cone  The cone made it pretty good   No place to properly sit or anything was a major shortcoming for me   especially since it s not in a convenient location ,3,2018-01-07
Very busy place  Long line up  Polite customer service  Very delicious ice cream and cookies ,5,2019-08-19
More like a        Is the ice cream delicious  Yes  Is it mind blowing  Nope  I d rather do Sweet Olenka or even SOMA s    Are the cookies delicious  Yes  Is it mind blowing  Nope  Le Gourmand wins out   What I don t get about this place is that the wait time is roughly   hour long  You can literally just walk   m north to the original   Bakerbots   and not get stuck in any lineup ,4,2015-09-07
After trying countless ice cream fads all over Toronto and even LA  from rolled ice cream to all sorts of funky creations  this place is the only one that is actually worth it    Sure the lineup might be    minutes on a Sunday night  but you can meet cool new people and bask in the glory of ossington s undeniable hipness    We tried matcha in a puff and golden Oreo in the birthday cake cookie  The latter was ok  although I really like the big chunks of Oreo for some textural diversity in the ice cream   The former was what got me hooked  OMG  The matcha flavour is so strong and delicious and the puff is just the icing on the cake    They also have cool other flavours like taro  beer and bread  something along those lines  and burnt toffee which I will be definitely be trying in the near future   The one thing that bothers me is how there is ZERO seating  Like maybe one bench that always seems to be taken  And it sucks because their ice cream sandwiches are so messy and definitely are something you should eat sitting down   If you have the patience  come try this place out ,5,2016-08-17
Came on a Sunday afternoon the long was pretty long  but fast  The guy at the counter was nice and helpful  There was tons of flavor to choose from i had a hard time selecting which i want  Finally after of few min debating i settle on Totaro  Purple Yam Ube  and banana pudding on a cup with a cone on the top  for picture    Totaro was good but banana pudding was amazing   I wish bang bang ice cream was in NYC,5,2017-04-20
Last time I was here  I had the London Fog ice cream sandwiched between ginger cookies  which was really good  I was looking forward to getting the London Fog again during this visit  but they didn t have it  But it s ok  I had the PB  n chocolate on a waffle instead    The PB  n chocolate wasn t very sweet  The richness of the chocolate was offset by the sufficient amount of peanut butter bits  The waffle  similar to what you can usually get at pacific mall  was amazing  It wasn t very sweet  It had a slightly crunchy outside  with a soft center  Made on the spot and served right away so it was warm  The wait for the waffle this time was less than    minutes  Last time I came during the summer  the wait for the waffle was    minutes  Definitely worth it though if you re not in a hurry  I would DEFINITELY go again ,5,2015-11-07
First time trying Bang Bang ice cream  I got one scoop of London Frog  earl grey  and one Taro  with birthday cookies  The ice cream was sooo soft and flavourful  The earl grey and taro went soooo well together  I went there near closing time at the store  their lovely staff even gave us couples of cookies just to try out  However  I still think birthday cookies are the best because they go well with everything  I would definitely come back here but this time I would get just scoops in a cup because I don t think spending extra money on waffle cone cake nor cookies is worth it ,5,2016-06-12
Bang Bang is an ice cream connoisseur s dream  I was biking home last night and for once there wasn t as an outrageous line up so I had to pull over and try it   I tried the London Fog ice cream by itself  I prefer my icecream alone  and it was DELICIOUS  Tasted like a cold London Fog tea but creamier    I could do without the long wait but hey good things are worth waiting for right ,4,2015-09-25
If you re going to wait in line for Bang Bang  you d better go big or go home    Serving ice cream inside a Hong Kong style waffle is not a novel idea  but Bang Bang s ice cream flavours are the best  My favourite flavours are the London Fog  the Lychee Raspberry  with rosewater   and some other tea flavour  I ve forgotten what it was exactly    I don t personally love their cookies  but that s ok because if I don t get the waffle  I usually get it in the puff and it s amazing as well ,5,2016-06-12
Long lines  busy and small storefront  BUT  incredible flavours worth the wait  London Fog  Lychee and Rosewater  Fresh Mint  and Cinnamon Toast to name a few ,5,2017-10-12
Burnt toffee ice cream and Hong Kong style waffles   I m from Hong Kong and I approve this masterpiece  The  bitter  taste from the burnt ice cream flavour mixed too well with the sweet waffles  The only concern is whether my stomach can take another one    Location wise is a lllitttttttllleeeeeeeeeeee too far from downtown core  at least for us students without a car  but bangbang totally worths the trip  Highly recommend this place and be sure to try all their homemade ice cream esp totaro and burnt toffee  Haven t tried their macaron ice cream sandwiches yet but I will be right back for them ,5,2015-04-03
The ice cream and cookies do live up to the hype  but that s all it is  hype  I guess that s why the line up here is crazy  from open until close every day    I personally feel it s a novelty and people just come here because it s the place to try in the Summer  Ice cream is never worth an hour s wait  Maybe if they sped up their service a little bit  I would give them an extra star  but for the long lines and slow service    star it is   If you can  go right when it opens around  pm  no line and still same quality ice cream    ,3,2015-12-22
Ok  this is hands down my favorite ice cream place in Toronto  I m not very proud of what I m going to say next but I have lined up for almost    mins to get a damn ice cream  multiple times  It was worth it every single time  And my opinion didn t change even after the diarrhea it followed  And again  diarrhea has nothing to do with ice cream  it s the lactose intolerance  Its bang bang every time  the first in the mouth and the second one in the washroom  Apologies for the gross review but I love this place ,5,2017-07-29
Well  jeez    this is just how ice cream should be   The flavors I tried are beyond delicious and I love the dense texture of their ice cream  The service is just fine  but you pay the money and they give you this delicious ice cream  so it s really hard to be critical or objective about anything when you re eating some of the most delicious ice cream in existence ,5,2016-12-20
Loads of unique ice cream flavors  We knew we were at the right place for ice cream when the line went out the door    Many of the flavors had nicknames so it was confusing to what was actually inside but the staff explains if you ask  Like the totoro is ube flavor  similar to taro  and the London fog is like a hongkong milk tea  As you guessed those two were my choice of flavors and it did not disappoint  I could eat those two flavors for days    I m looking forward to coming back and trying the other more crazy flavors ,4,2017-05-01
Definitely a place to hit especially in the summer time if you love cookies and ice cream   The only other place I can really compare it to right now is Baker Bots and if I had to choose between the two  it would be this place simply because I found that the cookies weren t over baked that it would crumble or break easily when biting into your ice cream sandwich   The added bonus was that they had avocado ice cream   That alone I d go back for   p s  Beware of hipsters ,5,2014-12-02
I am not rating this on actually trying anything   disclaimer    I came here as the reviews mentioned they had gluten free cookies  Well we came here  waiting in a long line AND the gluten free cookie option actually had oats  Oats are not gluten free in Canada  There are very expensive special gluten free oats you can buy   these were regular oats  The macaron option was also sold out    I waited over    minutes and was disappointed the staff couldn t answer my questions  She kept saying yes it gluten free and vegan     I think if you have no allergies this obviously seems like a great place to come   my friends enjoyed  BUT don t be misled if you have a gluten allergy    I also suggested they put a menu outside and what s sold out   they seemed to be out of a lot of ice cream and cookie options  Waste of time if they don t have what you want    I know they are NEW and busy  a good thing  and speaks to their success   Everyone was pretty nice  despite not really answering my gluten question  and they are working out the kinks    but they should put wheat free in their  gluten free  cookie option instead and note what they are sold out of outside   so you are not waiting     it s hard to walk in and ask before waiting  and they all seemed so busy and its a tiny space     If you are truly celiac or gluten intolerant beware   if not   enjoy  Sure wish I could have had one ,1,2014-08-10
Hands down  my favourite ice cream place in Toronto  My favourite flavours are the London Fog  milk tea bobba and totaro  purple potato   I usually get it with the bubble waffle if I have time  If not  then I get the double scoop with tapioca  if I get the milk tea flavour   I stop by everytime when I am in the area    Want to beat the rush  Go before the evenings  It tends to get busier after dinner time ,5,2018-08-28
This place is cute  Nice place to stop by on a Summer night  not sure about the Winter though  They have a variety of ice creams and cookies to choose from  I had the london fog ice cream with the oatmeal cookie plus a birthday cookie to go  The london fog ice cream was tasty and creamy  The cookies were good  a little bit on the hard side  i still I want to go back and try the ice cream in the egg ball cone thing   Price   i guess it s average for the downtown ossington queen street area    On a side note  the iPad you use to pay is gross and sticky ,4,2014-10-02
This ice cream place is jam packed       Expect a mini line up when you re here but it s worth it    The waffle ice cream looked legit but a    minute wait is a little extreme  Get the cookie ice cream and the flavours are special    We got   half cookie ice cream sandwiches   In one we got TOTARO  coconut and purple yam  and BURNT TOFFEE  In a gluten free  vegan cookie    The other cookie ice cream sandwich was a LONDON FOG  Earl Grey tea ice cream flavour  hello     I was obsessed  and CAMPFIRE MARSHMALLOW  tastes like childhood filled with chewy marshmallow bits    I wasn t too big of a fan of the gluten free  vegan cookie  I went for the healthy choice and I wish I had gone for the full buttery cookie choice     Go check it out  it s good for a date night  girls date  hot day  whatever   Good vibes all around   It,4,2016-07-16
We have already been here twice since discovering this place earlier this month  I know  I am a bit late to this party lol   The first time I took the bae there for his birthday dessert and we were blown away at how awesome the experience was   They will let you try any flavour you want if you are unsure if you might like it  everything we tasted was delicious though  The first visit  we ordered an ice cream sandwich to split  they are massive in my opinion  with an everything cookie on one side  a ginger cookie on the other  and two flavours of ice cream   cinnamon and insanely tasty beer and brown bread  We split an Americano coffee  which was perfect  The beer ice cream was so amazing  we ended up purchasing a pint and took it home    As others have mentioned  the line ups are long  even in the colder weather days when we visited  But the people working here are super friendly and move as fast as they humanly can  We only waited like   minutes both visits which was reasonable   I have dreams of the treats here  Bang Bang is so so good  I doubt I will wait in the crazy line ups on the warmer weather days but you never know   ,5,2015-04-28
Revisited this place on April when weather warmed up and there was already a line up  My friend and I both got the Macaron Ice Cream sandwich for       each  The macaron shells were super sweet  dry and super tough  On a separate occasion  my friend visited this place and he also complained that the macaron was also bad  I was quite disappointed as on my last visit  the puff pastry suffered the same problem   On the other hand  the ice cream was delicious  The avocado ice cream wasn t overly sweet and had a great creamy texture  I sort of regret my choice of ice cream  as I wasn t used to the salty sweet flavor of the miso and cherry  I felt like the ice cream was too salty and the cherry didn t have enough sweetness to balance the flavors   Overall after two visits  I still enjoyed my experiences at Bang Bang and I would definitely come back to try other ice cream flavors  On my next visit  I would pick the Hong Kong waffle or get regular scoops  instead of trying their baked goods as they were all disappointing ,4,2015-05-26
This was one of my favourite spots this summer  I tried several different ice cream cookie combinations and was never disappointed  Can t wait till warmer weather to try it out again    Usually a long line but always worth the wait ,5,2015-01-18
Good YES OVERRATED totally     When the lineup in the summer is approx ummm       mins please ensure all selections are available when you finally make it up to order,3,2015-09-20
Omg this place is sooo good  My friend and I were talking about going here for years and finally chose a day near the end of the summer when it started to get chilly thinking that the line wouldn t be too bad  It was great  I had green tea ice cream in a cookie and stood around outside and caught up with my friend  I d definitely go back  Too bad it s so far away from any places I frequent ,5,2017-02-24
Love Bang Bang Ice cream  Do not love the long line ups   I been here twice now and I got the Ice Cream sandwich twice now   Will try the Hong Kong Egg Waffles next time   They are def short on staff a this place as   other group in front of me were all served but no one was there to cash us out   We saw a few workers stare and noticed us but they never came to help or ask someone to take over   It caused a huge jam in the already small place   Like serious the guy in front of my wave and said  excuse me  a few times to the girl she just looked and walked away   Only complain I have here or I would ve given it a   star   The ice cream is good and lots of variety to pick from   I love the  almost everything  cookie for my Ice Cream sandwich   Yummy  can t wait to be back when the weather warms up,4,2015-06-03
                                                                                                               ,5,2019-07-26
Delicious   great selection and flavours for vegans too    The only thing would be to maybe have someone take a bit of time to explain how to order  It goes really quickly and can be overwhelming   All in all it was amazing,5,2018-08-23
LOTS of ice cream options at this shop   I have tried the burnt toffee  my favourite   the chocolate  pretty good   the espresso  too coffee flavoured and I typically do like coffee flavoured ice cream   dolce de leche  waaay too sweet   and mint  a bit too medicinal   The cookies  the everything and pb cookied  are DELICIOUS  I like fresh cookies that have a bit of a crunch to them and these fit the bill   We were lucky to have gone when it wasn t very busy   based on other reviews  it sounds like it can get really crowded   The staff is friendly and helpful  offering samples when I couldn t make up my mind   The ice cream is very rich and creamy and flavourful  It reminds me a bit of the ice cream shops I ve been to in California although a bit pricier     I came here two nights in a row and the second night definitely was overkill  It s too much of an indulgence to have often  in my opinion ,3,2014-06-25
This place gets ice cream right   With a wall full of tantalizing ice cream flavours marked on cans  we were almost glad to wait in the notoriously long lineup while deciding on our flavours   Flirting with the idea of either Chestnut Matcha or Peanut Butter   Chocolate  I opted for the bold Espresso ice cream while my date went with the Pumpkin Spice flavour to celebrate the onset of Fall  Needless to say  trying both flavours together created the perfect Pumpkin Spice Latte ice cream   Bang Bang has a cool vibe befitting its Ossington home  with amazing aromas thanks to its heavily used waffle iron  Next time I go  I m trying my ice cream in a cookie or between a waffle ,4,2015-10-28
I wish I could eat ice cream every day  I would eat THIS ice cream every day  Long lines are typical  but with good reason  and they generally move reasonably fast  You ll save time if you skip the fresh bubble waffle  but it s well worth the wait ,5,2018-10-04
There was a short wait when I went but I think it was because no one seemed to know what they wanted  Personally I appreciated the wait because it gave me a chance to figure out what I wanted  which is pretty hard seeing as how I m super indecisive   I ended up getting the burnt toffee and lychee flavored ice creams in a HK waffle cone  The flavors were AWESOME and I loved how fresh the waffle cone was  The combination was seriously amazing  My friend got the matcha and London fog with the waffle cone and after I tried the London fog  I was beating myself up because I didn t pick it  Another great flavor  As you can tell  we tried to get their more unusual flavors and I highly recommend it because they have some really cool ones ,5,2015-08-18
    maybe a           then  Great Selection and creative combinations   The variety of cookies looks great too  Portion of icecream in the half cookie sandwich was generous when I went there   The actual texture of the icecream wasnt as creamy as I would have hoped   I got to taste one ice cream before choosing my  dollar half sandwich  One   They have a sign up that you are only allowed one taste cause of the long line up  One   Tasted the coffee one  meh  I ll stick to my haggen das on that one   Ended up with the Lechee raspberry made with egg  Was yummy   not so creamy though   With an oatmeal cookie   Not as soft and chewy as I would have hoped  kinda hard  Portion size was good as I mentioned   so much so that half sandwich which was one cookie was a bit much   sweet on sweet   thats a lot of sweet to deal with after dinner    So docked a star or      stars for the not so creaminess which I prefer in my icecreams and the one taste test  So one taste test and if you choose another flavor you are winging it for   dollars   Just saying ,4,2015-11-30
A nice shnack    Make sure to ask the staff about trying out the multitude of different ice cream flavours before deciding on what to go with ,4,2019-03-04
Ladies and gentleman    these genius creators at bang bang have created a master piece that I am absolutely loving  In fact I drool over the thought of having it again   Good humour me  lovingly made from crushed golden Oreos with strawberries  Hello Einstein s of ice cream this is such a genius combination    This is the bomb dot com flavour  Added with crumbs of golden Oreos cookies and dried strawberry on top    it s heavenly orgasmic that it s sinful  My friend made a Sammie out of it with birthday cake cookies  these cookies are bad ass they had hints of lemon zest    brilliant like it just enhanced the sandwich  and I had them with the HK waffle  Needless to say    I will be back  And they better not take this flavour away  I would cry  Its so damn delicious ,5,2018-04-28
Best quality handcrafted ice cream ever in T O  The huge lineup even in winters says it all  Good combination of the  ice cream  flavor vs  the actual ingredients  e g  the strawberry flavor doesn t taste too sour like actual strawberries  but not fake enough like bad quality ice cream  But you know they use the real thing in there    ,5,2018-07-18
I really don t understand the hype of this place  The Wait for us was approximately    minutes before we got to place our orders  They have many different unusual flavors which is nice  But I find that their ice cream are just average  For me  I certainly do knows bad tasting ice cream  This isn t bad  but its also isnt anything that I would wait in line for either ,3,2017-07-19
Came here on a March afternoon  It was somewhat busy for people waiting on waffles but nowhere as bad as we ve seen in summer   For those unfamiliar with the neighbourhood be advised there is no sitting room outside or inside   It s akin to an ice cream counter  We ordered one waffle with vanilla bean and London fog and a plain puff with rocky roadkill  The waffle was alright  Ice cream was amazing  The puff ice cream component went well as the Rocky roadkill was very rich    Summer time lines aren t worth it  but definitely try it on a sunny but Chilly March afternoon ,4,2016-03-19
The  Bees Knees  flavour is to die for  I love this place  It s expensive  but so are all of the good ice cream places in Toronto ,4,2017-10-04
You most try their freshly bake Puff with ice cream  is the best   If the line up in this place wasn t son big  I will give them   stars,4,2017-09-21
Two words  Golden Oreo  Dare I say it   golden oreo ice cream from Bang Bang is the best ice cream I ve ever had   And this is coming from a die hard cookies and cream person  Whoever came up with this magical concoction is a visionary and deserves a raise ,5,2018-06-10
The best summer ice cream hangout spot  Their ice cream sandwiches are huge and can replace a meal ,5,2017-10-04
Holy  What a range in flavours  I am absolutely a fan  Profiteroles stuffed with deliciousness  Yes  I love their creativity and their cookies too ,4,2015-12-08
Foru of us lined up for    minutes to eat fake banana flavoured ice cream  tasted like those cheap banana candies you can get   ube ice cream with absolutely no flavour  literally none  like eating air and bizarre overly minty ice cream  I am someone who loves mint in everything  but this had weird fake mint chemically taste  And to top it off server who will not disclose if polysorbate    is in the cream for people with gastric issues   not sure what exactly people like about this other than the aesthetic   looks good therefore it is good sort of thing   ,1,2017-06-19
Basically    I want to try the whole wall   There are some funky flavours that are super enticing  Line up wasn t so bad for a Saturday noon that I went   Prefer this place more than overly decked out soft serve ice cream places,4,2016-07-05
Hands down my favourite and go to ice cream place in Toronto GTA  I don t care that it s not close to a subway station I will gladly make the trek both in the summer and the winter  I absolutely LOVE this place  There are over     UNIQUE flavours of ice cream and amazing cookies and HK style waffle cones to go along with them   I was able to try the  I love Oolong Time   Oolong Tea   Totoro  Ube   and London Fog  Earl Grey   I got the Totoro and London Fog in an egg waffle cone and my friend got the Oolong in between cookies    all were spectacular  For someone who loves tea these flavours really hit the spot and has made me crave them ever since getting them  Never had a place make earl grey ice cream like they do   There s usually a huge line for this place during the summer but I came when it was drizzly and rainy out so the wait  yes there was still a wait   wasn t too bad  Come at off peak hours if you re impatient and definitely ask to sample the flavours you re curious about ,5,2017-06-08
I LOVE THIS PLACE  I ve lined up many times and I would do it again  I love their Fruity Loops and Key Lime Pie ice cream in the Hong Kong waffle and puff  It does get crowded once you re inside waiting for the waffle  they make it fresh  but it s worth it  The only other thing they could use is more seating as walking and eating ice cream sandwiches can get quite messy   still delicious either way ,5,2016-08-14
Quality flavour ice cream that I would not even think that you can make to a favoured ice cream  Definitely coming back here when I visit home again  even be it in the winter  Going to try their cinnamon toast  burnt toffee  their beer and espresso based flavours   I went here tonight for one thing and one thing only  London fog  I m glad I got it  Definitely creamy  Not that sweet  The most important thing is it tastes like London Fog  A more solidified London fog  I had it on a     oatmeal cookie ,5,2015-08-22
I love this place  I usually go fairly close to their opening time  and hardly ever have to wait in line  The ice cream flavours are all intense and taste exactly as you expect them to by their names  They have some out there unique flavours  and standards like chocolate and vanilla   For ice cream I ve tried  Bellwoods Stout   Like stout and vanilla ice cream mixed together  Pretty boozy  in a good way  Chocolate    Dark chocolate with chocolate pieces in it  Very rich and delicious  SJCB   Ground coffee beans  My favourite flavour  London Fog   Amazing  Tastes exactly like it should  Earl Grey tea  vanilla  and cream  Corn on the Cone   I think there s Corn Pops cereal in this one  A little weird  but definitely a sweet  dessert take on corn flavour    The three cookies I ve tried  Rococoa  Everything  and Birthday  are all delicious    This is the best ice cream in the neighbourhood by far  hands down ,5,2014-08-15
Get there early   I made the mistake of going after dinner and they were out of all   flavours I requested  however  I enjoyed the vegan mango flavour  Next time I won t get the rice pudding on top  it was too sticky  Friends got different flavours of the icecream sandwiches  I would recommend the sandwich that they warm up because it tastes so much better  It was a long line and wait so we demolished the icecream as soon as we got it and forgot the pictures  I love the look and the staff was extremely pleasant and patient to deal with  I recommend it ,5,2017-10-05
I came here for the first time and tried the Ice cream in a waffle cone which was freshly made right in front of us  Waffle was soft and was not to sweet  The ice cream was definitely the star of the show,5,2016-10-13
Been here a few times and definitely worth the wait  Had the mango and coconut  with sticky rice  I ve cream and it was AMAZING  This place has never let me down and is definitely my favourite dessert place in the city ,5,2016-06-12
Bang Bang Ice Cream is one of those places I have been meaning to try for many months but just never managed to actually make it here  The line outside was long and for ice cream that is usually a pretty good sign of things to come  The menu is pretty detailed and explains the options before even entering  I decided to go with the puffy waffle cone which was nice and warm when it was served and filled with mint chip and cookies and milk ice cream  The second it was handed to me I knew it was going to be delicious and it absolutely was  This is a place that I would most definitely come back to just so I could try a cookie sandwich and some more of the unique flavours made in house  A      ,5,2017-02-19
Bang Bang has been on the list of things to do for the past year   We finally had the chance after attending a Pan Am event and the TTC was included in our tickets so we made the trek up   There is no sign telling you that you re in the right place  but the line up tells all   It was quite a long wait but we never go downtown so we decided to stay   We arrived around  pm and found out that it closes at   pm   The wait ended up being     hours   I have never in my life waited that long for anything  not even rides at Wonderland or Disney World    Luckily some people in line were nice and we passed the time chatting    They have a great selection of ice creams but when we got closer  and as they run out  the flavours are turned around   I really wanted  Mud   espresso  roasted almonds  and fudge  but they ran out just as we made our way to the counter   I ended up settling for a egg waffle with Espresso and Rocky Roadkill   The wait was an extra    minutes for the egg waffle cone   The reason for this   They only have   waffle irons     How do they expect to keep up with the demand when each waffle takes almost   minutes to make   They really need to invest in more irons   At Pacific Mall  they use at least   irons and have less customers   Would I go back   Most likely not if the wait is more than    minutes   We ve discovered Kekou on Baldwin near McCaul and their flavours are much more interesting and less wait time ,4,2015-07-28
I ve always heard lots about this ice cream shop and it looks super cute from pictures so I definitely wanted to stop by  I went on a Saturday afternoon and surprisingly the line wasn t too long  The shop is pretty small on the inside so the line still went out the door but the wait only took    mins or so   You re only allowed to try   sample flavour per person  I ordered the pink lemonade ice cream with   birthday cake cookie  I think   cookie is a really good size since they don t cheap out on the amount of ice cream they put in the middle   perfect snack size  I don t think I would get pink lemonade again though because I found that it got too sour as I ate more and more of that taste but that s my own personal preference  The cookie was delicious    As a note   they also have pastries right by the cashier under the glass display that you can fill ice cream into  I didn t realize this until I already ordered my ice cream sandwich and was waiting to pay ,4,2017-06-30
really good   greats flavors and ideas   personally I get it on a cookie,5,2016-10-26
I ve been in love with London Fog ice cream for years  and it still tastes delicious  It s my favourite  This time I paired it as a half sandwich with the everything cookie which was baked really well  I also got the genmaicha tiramisu ice cream  I also recommend the burnt toffee half sandwich on a ginger cookie  At first I was worried that the ginger cookie will be too spicy with ginger and molasses  but it had a nice but not too sweet taste to it  and was a perfect pairing with the burnt toffee  The service was super friendly  although there was a small wait  it was worth it  There s still so many more flavours and cookies that I m dying to try  so I would definitely be back ,5,2018-03-23
SOO good that I ll still come here when winter arrives   A must get is the HK waffle  and my favourite ice cream flavour is totoro aka taro and Earl grey  Expect long line ups  but I d say  it s worth it   You can also try samples before you decide  but try not to sample too much because there will be tons of customers behind you and they ll get mad lol ,4,2015-10-08
This was my last stop in Toronto before heading back to the States and it certainly did not disappoint  My boyfriend and I arrived a little before the store s opening time but there was already a group of people who were waiting ahead of us  After we got in line  many people started to line up behind us which made me feel eternally grateful that we got here earlier than expected to avoid a long wait time   Once the store opened my nose was filled with the aroma of freshly baked cookies  The line moved quickly and we didn t end up waiting too long until we were able to place our order  We ended up getting one scoop of london fog and one scoop of burnt toffee on a sugar cone  Both of these flavors complimented each other very well but if I can only choose one  my vote would be on London fog  The light taste of earl grey made this sweet treat taste even more decadent  The burnt toffee had some pretty large bits of toffee mixed in which did make it hard to solely appreciate the ice cream itself   Do note that there is no seating inside  There are a few benches outside which fill up quickly so space is pretty limited  Make sure you have a back up plan of where you can enjoy your delicious goodness ,4,2019-10-01
Poll question     how far will you drive for food     min     min   Poll question     how far will you drive for ice cream   Poll question     how long are you willing to wait in line   These are important questions when you think about going to Bang Bang  It s not my regular stomping ground and not even near a freeway  AND it takes planning  My son says the line can be    minutes long  That s a long time to wait for sthg that you ll gobble up in less than   minutes   The best thing to do is arrive shortly before   pm  when they open    I ve been twice in   days  but don t tell my husband    The first time  I felt like fruit flavours so I went with the vegan passionfruit and the signature lychee raspberry rose  The vegan passionfruit has the most interesting texture   almost a granita   very crumbly and delicate  Scoop too hard and the ball could explode  Very delicious   I was prepared to be underwhelmed by the lychee raspberry rose as I m used to the Ispahan at Pierre Herm  in Paris  To my delight  it was aromatic and not too sweet  Satisfying  and cheaper than a plane ticket to CDG   The second visit was espresso and chocolate time  Loved the espresso with tiny bits of San James ground coffee bean  Chocolate ice cream was quite good too  My only complaint was that the ice cream was a bit melted  I had to eat fast and drink the remainder ,5,2017-07-24
Surprisingly their egg bubble waffle recipe was on POINT for a place that isn t what you usually think of as authentically Asian  Thick chewy bubbles was the perfect outer wrapping for the gelato flavours we picked  Cookies and Cream and Banana Pudding    Cookies and cream was good but nothing spectacular  but it s my husband s fave flavor so he always gets it lol  The Banana Pudding was    Wow  So good  Great banana flavors and wonderfully creamy  Such a unique flavor   Their biggest draw is their many different unique flavours you won t find anywhere else in Toronto    Only con is the line up is long in the evening  especially weekends but even weekdays in  the summer  although they try very hard to get through as many people as possible    Definitely a must try in Toronto ,4,2018-10-06
You know an ice cream place is great when there is a line out the door in    degrees celcius weather and it s snowing  They have a plethora of flavors unique to even your most different ice cream shop  Their cookies as well are cheap and light yet crispy thin    I ordered me a scoop of the matcha jasmine  It was a great combo to split  It tasted like a toasted green tea  Ice cream is great quality with it s dense creaminess   There s no where really to eat unless outside when the place is busy and people are packed inside to order    This place give Los Angeles ice creameries a run for their money ,5,2019-03-18
Between two people we shared the     ice cream sandwich on the everything cookie and london fog and the waffle with a scoop of lychee and matcha ice cream  The waffle  hong kong style egg waffle  took about      min wait so we had the ice cream sandwich first  The cookie was chewy and all the ice cream was certainly not too sweet which we enjoyed  We got lucky and avoided the rush  but the moment we paid for our order the line went out the door  Will definitely come again next time the weather is warm and they have such large appetizing selection which is rare ,4,2016-10-03
First ever icecream sandwich     It was summer the place was new I think we waited over an hour I ll go back,4,2015-04-25
Bang Bang is consistent  Every visit I ve made has been well worth it because everything they sell is just so good   I ve had quite a variety of ice creams and pastry combinations from here  from fruit flavours to caramels and from waffles to cream puffs   Just yesterday  I had their plain cream puff stuffed with lychee   raspberry rosewater ice cream          Usually  I like to get their HK style egg waffle stuffed with two flavours of ice cream          My first visit here  I got an ice cream cookie sandwich          Everything is just so consistently good here  so feel free to try your random and unusual pastry ice cream combinations  Somehow  some way  it just works   Their ice cream flavours rotate  but my personal favourites have been burnt toffee  roasted marshmallow  and totaro  Mmm,5,2016-11-18
Love Bang Bang Ice Cream    I m a fan of the Totaro  London Fog  and the Lychee with Raspberry Curd and Rosewater   They have a long list of other fun flavours that are gems  I like to get the Waffle option but be warned that the ice cream at the bottom in the cone  usually melts because of the heat from the fresh Waffle  Their cookie flavours are also delicious for the Ice cream sandwich option   It s a great place for a special treat and I love bringing friends and family from out of town to show them how cool  too punny   Ice Cream can be in the city ,5,2016-02-19
I am not an ice cream lover  If I m going to eat it  it has to be exciting and it has to be good  BBIC fulfils this  My favourite product is their mochi  Those are amazing and if I could I d order boxes of them  If not that  then a cup pint  No regular cones  as far as I remember  The cookies that make the sandwiches are okay  and the waffle so so  I m surprised those are so popular  It works out for me  because I ve seen those machines break down enough times  Also because there s no seating  unless you re parked  it might be annoying to walk with the sandwiches or waffles depending on the weather  If you re getting the sandwich  DON T make the mistake of thinking  half sandwich  means  small   I love to eat  but a full sandwich was more than I needed  and messier     The wait  Like many places with crazy wait times  it s less fanaticism and more lack of space  As well as employees that could try to pick up the pace a bit  though they re certainly good at hurrying you along  which can be a problem if it s your first time  Here are all these wild new flavours  but you can t sample them properly  A friend of mine was soured on them because of this   But the ice cream itself is top notch and worth it  I ve tried many  but my favourites are Corn on the Cone and Taro  Their chocolate flavours aren t anything new  so if you re making the effort go for something different   I m sure many people know this  but if you re after their more popular flavours  go to Bakerbots up the street at Ossington Station They re sister companies  I believe they make the cookies and they ve got some of the flavours with less wait  not  no  wait  ,4,2015-10-17
After hearing all the hype about this place  I finally had time to visit Bang Bang this summer  Specifically  last month  Went on a weekend around  pm and found the line up ok        mins  Did not have to wait an  hr  as some yelpers have mentioned  However  later on quite a lot of people started to line up behind me  Closer towards       So I guess I was lucky with timing    I had expresso ice cream sandwiched together with oatmeal cookies and dates  Cookies were really good  soft and chewy  Originally  was going to try egg waffle      but it was going to take too long  I bumped into someone I knew who was waiting for their egg waffle order and they said staff claimed it would take    mins to get it     mins later    they were still waiting  I left before they did  found out after that it took about   min for the egg waffle  That s just ridiculous  I could have gotten my first order  lined up again while I eat my ice cream sandwich and order a second ice cream in that amount of time  Lol    Honestly  Bang Bang has great ice cream  unique flavours like beer taro london fog  etc  but it s not worth the    hr wait  If you desperately want egg waffle  you can go to the chinatown plaza at Dundas and Spadina  There is an egg waffle stall next to a Dairy Queen  Lol  Plus you can get a soft serve at Dairy too  Less    and under   min for both  Haha    FYI  There is not much seating available except a bench  so this is definitely a grab and go place ,4,2015-09-25
I heard a lot of good things about the ice cream here and I just had to try for myself   It did not disappoint   My gf got the HK waffle cone and I got the ice cream cookie sandwich   We waited in line for over     hours  mine took about   hour  but the HK waffle took very long because one of their grills were broken    They had a huge variety of ice cream to choose from   I had to key lime ice cream and it was exquisite  Originally wanted the taro flavor but it was sold out by the time it was my turn to order   It was not too sweet  and it was a bit sour just the way I like it   The cookie was thick and chewy  just how a cookie should be made    Definitely enjoyed it here  however if I had to line up for     hours again I wouldn t do it ,4,2015-12-23
This place is excellent   Really delicious  innovative flavours   I m not the biggest ice cream lover and even I enjoyed it ,5,2017-10-04
I ve been trying to come back here since the last time I visited    years ago  and everytime I pass this place there is always a line up   even in this cold a   Toronto weather  But finally  even with a little lineup I was able to make an order  I got the half sammie         with the Rococo    cookie  totoro and earl grey ice cream  I ve had the taro ice cream flavour before so I knew it wouldn t disappoint but I was a little iffy about earl grey since I m not that big on it  However  I actually and surprisingly enjoyed the early grey flavour more than taro   so yes  I suggest trying it  the first taste slaps you in the face with early grey but you really start to enjoy it after the next few licks   The cookie unfortunately was not soft but I reaaally wish it was   I would ve enjoyed it a lot more but otherwise it was still good  My boyfriend ordered the double scoop of banana pudding         and it was super yummy   another flavour I highly suggest   The place is really small and can get really congested  Also   Bang Bang  is not really labeled anywhere big enough to see from across the street so keep an eye out for it  They have tons of flavours   really unique ones so prepare to be overwhelmed  I know I was   They also sell them in pints containers  They re very friendly and helpful when it comes to us indecisive folks so don t be afraid to ask  They also offer other baked goods like cinnamon buns and you can ask for samples ,5,2018-04-06
Very creative and delicious ice cream  The made on demand soft waffle cones are worth the trip alone  Cookies not my style  hard   Be prepared to line up  I mean  it s really good       Not sure worth the lines IMHO ,4,2018-09-26
I had the ice cream cookie  which is very good  and fairly large  it s a very popular place in the summer  Decent flavours  you can also get a cone  Very imaginative  The whole Ossington strip has become one offs  This place is right in line with everything else on the strip ,4,2018-01-23
Great baked goods  Quick service  Great assortment of ice creams for both vegans and non vegans  There s no place to sit so it s a grab and go basis,5,2017-11-08
This place is all hype  I went with a few friends and we all got their ice cream sandwiches  I got their everything cookie with the burnt toffee ice cream  I don t know   it just wasn t that amazing like I thought it would be  The burnt toffee ice cream was WAY too sweet and the cookie although was better than I thought seeing as it had pretzels in it  but when combined with the ice cream was just meh  Plus  we had to wait in line for about    minutes only to have an okay dessert  I would say skip the line and go for ice cream some place else  and come back to this place when the line isn t so crazy  I would never willingly choose to go back here unless someone really wanted to have it ,3,2016-08-09
Beware for long wait ups in this super cute  sister shop  to BakerBots  I got the     ice cream sandwich cookie with birthday cake and toTARO this time  The birthday cake cookie had citrusy notes and I found that the everything cookie was much better whith more texture and flavour  The totaro ice cream was still delicious as well ,4,2018-07-21
Was absolutely dying to try a bubble waffle ice cream concoction but had no internet on my phone and my friend s phone pulled this up  Loved it  We had a    minute wait     of which was for the waffle   and the flavors were great  We weren t impressed by the burnt toffee  and didn t know was totaro was  so totally missed the ube flavor  Best part about the waffle cone was that the ice cream didn t leave it soggy  nor did it drip through and make a mess  Loved the place  but just not the wait ,4,2017-06-11
Want to stand in line for    minutes  only to be abused by rude sales staff  be my guest  Plenty of other ice cream shops around where customers are valued  Never again ,1,2018-06-19
We didn t know what the huge lineup was about until we eventually got to the counter just before they closed at    PM    We got the campfire marshmallow ice cream  and the London Fog   both in puffs  Seriously so good   The marshmallow had huge gooey chunks of campfire goodness  and the London Fog was so subtly sweet I would absolutely have that exact same thing again ,5,2015-12-05
I made a visit to Bang Bang for an after work snack and I was quite impressed with the quality of their ice cream flavours and freshly baked goods    I finally decided to try this place after numerous posts from my friends on Instagram always making visits to the place  so decided to go see for myself and see what the excitement was all about    There were so many delicious ice cream flavours to choose from for half ice cream sandwich I was planning to order  It was so hard to choose that the staff actually allowed to sample multiple flavours before I could make a decision  Normally  they only allow one sample per person  but it was nice of them to let me try a few combinations  I eventually decided on the Miso and Cherries ice cream  which honestly  was heaven in mouth  The saltiness of miso compliments the ice cream base and the cherries very well  which was a satisfying taste    Although the wait time can be long  longer on weekends   the ice cream sandwiches waffles are definitely work the wait  The decor is very vintage with its simplicity in colours and design   The service was excellent as the staff definitely helped me make an informed decision on what to get    Overall  I cannot wait to go back for more of their ice cream  I definitely recommend anyone with a sweet tooth to go check this place out ,4,2015-10-22
Burnt Toffee  Taro and London Fog are my go to ice cream flavours  I love them so much that when possible  I buy a tub back so I can pig out privately at home   Had their ice cream in cookies  in a cup and in the Hong Kong waffle  They re all amazing  I love the burnt toffee because of the little pieces of toffee that surprises you when you re eating it   a difference in texture   Parking can be a pain as there is only street parking and the lines can get long  Staffs are great people  I would most definitely come back ,4,2016-05-10
Come here  It s amazing  It s a totally different dessert experience than your normal ice cream place  They have very interesting flavors to choose from  I went with Cinnamon Toast and I got it in a RoCocoa cookie  which was basically a double chocolate cookie  This was incredible  They have the option of having the ice cream in a cookies  a cream puff  a puffy waffle cone or just a cup reg cone  I loved every second of this experience  I will return ,5,2017-02-19
Delicious  Amazing cookies and ice cream  Way too long a line  They need to figure out how to quicken up the service  But worth a go if you re not waiting an hour or more in line ,5,2016-03-07
Worth the wait  Came here on a Sunday afternoon around  pm and had to wait about    minutes for my ice cream  The line to order doesn t take that long  maybe about    minutes  but then it was another    minutes for them to make my egg waffle  If you just want ice cream  you don t need to wait any longer than that   but why wouldn t you want the egg waffle when you re already there   I got the egg waffle with Totaro  ube ice cream  and Love Ooolong Time  oolong tea   You get to choose two scoops of ice cream for your waffle  My friend got the Totaro and London Fog  earl grey   Everything was AMAZINGGGG  My favorite was the oolong tea  then the ube  then the earl grey  Their ice cream is rich in flavor and super smooth but not overly sweet either  which I loved  And their egg waffle was perfectly crispy on the outside with just the right amount of doughy cake texture on the inside  I loved it  I can t wait to come back and try all their other flavors   Be warned though  eat your ice cream quickly because the egg waffle gets soggy on the bottom ,5,2016-06-16
I understand that this place is a sister spot for Bakerbots  but the huge line up just isn t worth it for me  Besides that the cookies and ice cream is delicious  and my favourite is the salted caramel flavour toffee flavour   If you re looking to avoid this line just go to their original location Bakerbots at Bloor Dovercourt almost the same flavours and both locations are just as good ,3,2016-12-28
Bang bang always seems to have a huge line up  Last time we passed by  we saw a line  and moved on  This time  after walking for    minutes  we decided since we already made the trek here might as well wait in line  And it was a huge line  If we were late by a few minutes we would ve had to wait in an even longer line  The line never seems to end  Business must be booming for them       IF YOU WANT TO SKIP THE LINE     There is a fridge on the side full of  pre made  ice cream sandwiches and pints  If you re in a group  send someone to scout out the fridge and see if there s products that you re looking for   Now  assuming you re still in line    This is probably the only place in the area that offers uncommon ice cream flavours  And probably the only place that even sells ice cream for that matter  There s about    or so flavours to choose from listed in buckets along the back wall  and they re not your basic  chocolate    vanilla    peppermint chocolate  whatever flavours you get from baskin robbins  You get to choose things like  soursop    matcha    lychee    avocado   or  London Fog    They offer four different products  ice cream in a cone  ice cream in a cup  ice cream sandwiches   sammies   and ice cream with HK egg waffles   bang bang waffle    Samples are available if you would like to try before you buy  If you get the waffle  expect to wait an extra       minutes because it takes time to prepare the waffle   I ordered the bang bang waffle with matcha and burnt toffee  Waffle was made fresh  though not as crispy as I would like it to be  The ice cream was very good  Burnt toffee came with some crunchy pieces of toffee  I had a sample of the lychee ice cream and it was also very good   I can see why this is a popular place  but can t understand why people would wait    minutes and just get one cup of ice cream  Go big  get a pint  You ve been in line for so long ,4,2017-08-04
Great rotating assortment of flavours  Price wise  it won t break the bank  The best part is that it s not in the middle of the Entertainment district  so lineups aren t going to make you turn away ,4,2016-09-26
 OMG    O  M  G  BEST ice cream Everrrrrrrrrrr  I walked there for    min in the summer and it worth every sweat    They have different verity of ice cream flavours and my best one is the london fog  I am a big fan of earl grey and it didn t disappoint me  My friend ordered their taro flavour and it s super good as well  I finished the whole thing in less than   min and you know how much I love that thing  I wish that they can open another location closer to the financial district    I had mine with the  egg waffle   or whatever it calls     that one is just alright since I had better waffle in Markham  All my friends recommended me to get their ice cream sandwich instead so I will get that next time    I can literally eat this every single day and will not get sick of it  at least for now  ,5,2016-08-14
The cookies at Bang Bang are awesome  Their ice creams are amazing and unlike anywhere else  We now join ice cream and fresh cookies together in holy matrimony   Yes  you can come in this tiny place just for a scoop or a cookie  but Bang Bang is really more of a desserts wedding chapel that produces one of the most impressive of what seems to be a growing food trend in the city  at least that s the impression derived from the now defunct newsweekly The Grid  peace be upon them    the ice cream cookie sandwich   To initiate a date  simply choose your choice of ice cream  and then choose a cookie  They ll even offer pairing suggestions if you are at a loss because your brain is melting from all the choices  like key lime or Bellwoods stout  yes  the beer from nearby  with cookies like oatmeal   birthday   and  almost everything   It s       for a half sandwich  ie  a cookie cut in half and stuffed in between with a thick slab of ice cream   and    for a whole  Pricey  but complaining becomes difficult the moment you take a bite of your newly married delicious sandwich   Just on the cookie itself  their oatmeal raisin is definitely one of the best I ever had  Delicate  soft and sweet  But there s other things here  like macarons  Yes  you can have a macaron ice cream sandwich too  How does that work out  I don t know  but would like to try sometime soon    Bang bang  these cookies and  cream shot me down    TTC  the Ossington school bus to Argyle St  It s right across the street from Oddseoul  Hey kids  can you find Oddseoul  ,5,2014-07-04
We came on a Friday night  and we waited for round        mins  The store itself is really tiny  so most people just get their ice cream and eat outside  Me and my friends went on yelp and saw it has really good rating so we decided to give it a try  I got the totoro and the London fog   The London fog tasted like bubble tea  it was very subtle  doesn t have any after tea taste  The totoro tasted like creamy taro  and pretty milky    Would definitely recommend this place for anyone that wants to try some good ice cream but can stand the wait ,4,2017-04-17
I had the Rocky Roadkill  amazing  Seriously  the marshmallow is actually roasted and you can see it in the chunks in the ice cream  The waffle is definitely worth the wait  The cookies are great too ,5,2016-06-27
This place is the bomb  My favourite flavours are London fog  coffee  mud and fresh mint  I don t particularly like super sweet flavours so those are good choices  If you are really in for a treat get the roccoco cookie and fill it with one of the above flavours  You can thank me later ,5,2016-05-11
Ossington finally got what they ve so desperately been needing   an amazing ice cream shop  I m a ride or die for Bakerbots and this is the sister shop to just that   Go  Now  Wait in line  its never very long ,5,2014-06-16
I guess the bar has just been raised and the ice cream industry will never be the same   I strolled pass this place last evening and couldn t help but notice the hoards of people gathered around quietly feasting on ice cream treats   The inside was packed and the guy on the door said they were closed but he could let one more in if I want too  I thought that was so nice as people tend to be less flexible these days  The place fits in well in the ossi hood  and it was a thrill to be there   Definitely raising the bar  Check it out and be prepared to enjoy and sit among many smiling faces ,4,2014-06-30
Waited outside in the cold for    mins in March for ice cream at this popular joint and can t even complain because it was the best damn ice cream I ve ever had   Seemed like the Belgian waffle cone was their most famous menu item but I was more into the classic ice cream sammy so did not have to endure the additional    min wait for waffle machine  I got maltease me ice cream inside everything cookie  to die for   Can t wait to go back and try more of their interesting flavours ,5,2016-03-19
Very very loooong line up  Probably waited for close to an hour on a Sunday afternoon to get our ice cream sandwiches    Fantastic ice cream flavours    You get to choose cookie  waffles  or scones to sandwich your ice cream  Just make sure they don t over power the ice cream flavour ,4,2015-07-18
Slightly overrated I would say  There was a long line outside as we arrived at   pm on a Sunday night  only one waffle machines was active   The ice cream waffle cone was great  out of all the flavours I would recommend the peanut butter one for sure    One thing that stood out  and hence the   stars  would be the customer service which even at   pm was great  The people at the front were doing their best to manage the long line  although  using paper to write down orders is quite archaic  but smiling faces were good to see ,4,2015-09-26
Guess what would be fun in a big group  The owners are very friendly and our kids loved it  Wish it had more seating  Waffle is a must ,5,2015-06-23
We had high hopes for our desserts from here  And while what we got wasn t bad  and some of it was even very good  I can t say that we were wowed    First the good  The Hong Kong waffles are indeed amazing  When they re fresh and hot they are excellent all on their own    The cookies are also really good  It s a tough call whether to get an ice cream sandwich or a waffle  Either way  you can t go wrong with the baked goods    The ice cream however is only ok  The flavors are definitely interesting and inspired  But our problem was that the flavors weren t strong enough  There was no bourbon flavor in the bourbon bacon ice cream for example    Finally  the line  Yes  there is a huge line  But that s because inside it s total chaos  They need some serious help with their processes  We were sitting waiting  and waiting  for a waffle so we got to watch for a while  It was nuts  No semblance of order at all    Finally  beware  They sometimes end up   ing the waffles due to problems with the waffle iron ,3,2015-10-25
After standing in line for Uncle Tetsu s on Dundas and Bay  the line up at Bang Bang last night was nothing      although  it was long enough for us to wonder why there was a line up at all  since we were less than    people away from the front   As we inched our way ever closer to being inside the little shop  we asked ourselves   do you think it s the staff or the customers slowing things down    since we could see two scenarios      the hipsters in line taking forever and a day to choose from the expansive cookie ice cream combination  and or    the owners wanting to slow things down to create line up  buzz    In the end  we think it just came down to bad management   although there were a number of employees behind the counter  there didn t seem to be a lot of efficiency with how they were working   one seemed locked to the waffle maker and cash register  one was refilling ice cream  a couple were just kind of walking around  which left one person to actually take and fulfill orders   No real focus on moving the line   Annoying  but not so much it ruins the fact that this is a great concept  and that they have a great selection of inventive ice creams and options to wrap around them   We had an Everything Cookie sandwich with Burnt Toffee ice cream   great  although the ice cream may not have been quite cold enough  it melted too fast to enjoy eating it as a sandwich  the ice cream smooshed out of the cookie a little too quickly    Even better was the Avocado ice cream in a crisp topped cream puff   The cream puff was perfectly sized and held the generous scoop of ice cream from first to last bite  the full cookie sandwich was a little much for one person  but I guess that depends on your mood and hunger level   Next time  we ll try different cookies  but probably just do the half sandwich   Here s hoping they get faster as summer approaches ,4,2015-04-30
I have never been having a good chocolate ice cream till to I come to Bang Bang Ice cream  The chunk chocolate in the ice cream  the flavour  the size    I m lucky come when they just open  no line up  no waiting  staff is very friendly    The only thing I get a little confuse is the menu  And the price for the ice cream is almost     not a price you can have it all the time     Everything else is perfect to me ,4,2015-05-28
Overhyped place like most anything else in this  trendy  area  You can sell most any crap to those kids as long as you  package  it right for them  Besides catering to those tools  the ice cream itself is pretty ordinary in terms of taste  just that they come up with some creative varieties  So the taste is alright  however  the texture is often lacking  There are a bunch of places in Toronto with better tasting ice cream but less hype  It s usually a gooey mess you re eating  I have never tried the waffle because it would take a lifetime to get it  It takes them forever to prepare one  Be prepared to wait in line forever to get a scoop as the owners of this place never seem to bother with implementing a more efficient distribution system  Doesn t help that the staff is also super slow ,3,2016-06-12
This place is so yummy   The lineup was pretty long but well worth the wait    They only accept Cash or Credit  There s an ATM machine inside  They lost a star for no Debit    Highly recommend the Hong Kong Waffle  which comes with two scoops  Its a warm waffle cooked on the spot  I got this delicious waffle with a scoop of Vanilla Bean   Cinnamon Toast  I was able to eat the whole thing to myself   ,4,2015-07-04
Came here on a Friday at around       Sign outside warms you that it s during May to September and better     PM that the store is busiest  but I luckily had to wait just about    minutes    You have the option of choosing between a couple cones  a wide variety of cookies  or just scoops in a cup  which I got  Looking back I regret not getting a cookie ice cream sandwich since they looked so good  The ice cream was amazing however  I recommend both flavors I got  peanut butter cup and burnt toffee  The flavors with little pieces of candy chocolate whatever taste amazing so I recommend getting one of them    The staff were very nice as well  They offer samples so you can try the flavors which help in picking between all the flavors  I looked the cashier since she said she looked my jacket LOL    Overall  really good ice cream store that focuses on delicious ice cream rather than going overboard with toppings ,5,2018-06-23
Vegan options   Top row of ice cream  other than one  was all vegan  I had the chocolate one which water based and it wasn t as creamy as I would have hoped for but it was still pretty good  The vegan everything cookie was a bit too doughy for my taste  would have preferred a dryer cookie for an ice cream sandwich    Since a full cookie sandwich was about      that s really pricey   I d recommend getting a half sandwich and ask for two flavours you can get two mini scoops in your sandwich  The egg waffle cone looked adorable too and the line is not too long nowadays ,3,2016-06-17
Tried it over the winter since i hate those ridiculous line ups in the summer  The ice cream was ok but not worth all the hype    and of course it s not worth waiting an hour for ,3,2015-07-17
First time going  Pleasant staff  lots of selection  and decent prices  I am unlikely to go back simply because I rarely go to ice cream shops  but it was still a good experience   I got the full ice cream sandwich  You can pick two flavours for the full  I got half cookies milk  half PB J  I chose to keep the two flavours separate so I could experience each  and the cookie I chose was the peanut one   Both flavours were good  It was rather rich  rather dense ice cream  Certainly a well defined flavor  If you re a fan of rich ice cream  you ll like it   I tried a quick sample of the London Fog  It s accurate in that it tastes like Earl Grey Tea  but it s certainly not my    cup of tea      for full sandwich  I think half is fine  Get a full  choose two flavours  ask they be kept separate  and share with a friend or loved one  All you ll need to agree on is which cookie it ll be between   ,4,2016-04-27
I hate lineups  and I am not an ice cream addict  but this is the one ice cream place I line up for again and again   Everything here is homemade  super creamy  and lacks that mass produced additive fake ingredient taste that fills a lot of our foods these days    My go to scoops are london fog  black tea  and banana bread pudding   but if those flavours aren t up your alley  there are a ton more to choose from  all unique and super delicious   I like mine plain and simple in a cup  but they offer many other ways to eat your ice cream like in a puff  waffle  sandwiched between cookies    there is something for everyone   Don t let the long line scare you off  It s worth the wait   ,4,2015-07-16
I loved the vegan ice cream  I will totally get another one next summer  Also they just accept cash ,5,2017-10-11
Very hipster place and interesting flavors   I m glad you are able to sample a bit before making your selection   It s definitely worth a try   I tried the Totaro  purple yam  flavour ice cream sandwich with the peanut butter cookie    The ice cream undeniably is really good   You can really taste the yam  no artificial flavor or food coloring    It s not too heavy and gives off a refreshing taste   perfect during the summer   But I don t like how it s clumped with the cookie   Personal preference  but the ice cream itself was sufficient   I would go with a cone instead or you can try the egg waffle   The egg waffle though takes a bit of time  so please be a little patient   I had a taste of the Earl Grey as well   which is very milky and so natural   There are small sitting area available so you can hang around and enjoy   During certain times of the day  there is a line up   so time yourself accordingly ,4,2015-11-19
The best ice cream waffle cone in the city  I had rocky road and burnt toffee in a fresh waffle cone and I was so impressed that bang bang lived up to the hype  ,5,2016-08-04
Luckily we arrived at Bang Bang early so we didn t have to deal with a line  Still  I think their service could have been a lot faster  Ordered the Totaro Ice Cream  Taro  inside the waffle cone and is was delicious  Can t wait to go back and try their other flavours   Be sure to pick up a stamp card while you re there  I don t remember exactly but I believe you get a free ice cream sandwich with    stamps ,4,2015-06-24
Love this place    The nutella puff pastry stuffed with dulce de leche ice cream is sooooo good    It s a hit and miss sometimes with regard to the line up  I feel like the people who work their intentionally move slow to create a line  There just doesn t seem to be any urgency when the line up is just flowing down the block  Makes me so mad when I just want some ice cream  But anyway  the options are great  Plus the Birthday cookie is delicious ,4,2015-10-28
Cool small place located on Oss  Very unique ice cream flavours and well baked cookies  Not much more to say   During the summers  expect to wait in excess of    minutes ,4,2016-07-19
Love this place  Hong Kong waffle   London fog is heaven  There are many many more choices and the puffs  mochi are good too ,5,2016-05-01
One of my favourite icecream places in Toronto  Their london fog and corn in a cone icecream are my favourite ,5,2016-02-07
I ve been here a handful of times  over the summer  and there s always a HUGE line up  Despite the long line  I really like their ice cream  My favourite flavours are the london fog  totaro and SJCB espresso  Would recommended it to those who have    mins to an hour to spare to wait in line  The wait isn t that bad if you are with friends   ,4,2015-10-05
It s an ice cream parlor  with different flavors  Walked in  we were greeted by this amazingly polite server    He explained how it works  Basically you can choose cookies  waffle out profiteroles and choose ice cream flavors    I preferred freshly made waffle  with burnt toffee v and Banana caramel pudding as ice cream flavors    My son bought a chocolate cookie  Some of the weird flavors were avacado ice cream    It s in a relaxed neighborhood and finding parking is not as difficult as downtown  But I find the ice cream to be average there was nothing special so that s why   stars    But the service makes up for it  Ooh by the way the cookie was awesome which I stole from my son when he was done  Lol,3,2016-05-15
Amazing    It was so good  There was a little bit of a wait  but worth it  I got the waffle cone   Yummy  Hubby got the ginger cookie   wow    ,4,2017-10-09
I m struggling to answer if it was worth the    minute wait or not  but in the end  I absolutely LOVED my ice cream Sammy     I ordered the fig  goat cheese and honey  take that ice cream combo in  ice cream sandwich with the vegan oatmeal raisin cookie  It was simply outstanding    I could subtly taste all the flavours  No one overpowered the other  The texture and flavours in the house made cookie perfectly tied in the creaminess of the ice cream    Did I love it  YES   Would I wait another    minutes to buy another  Hmmmmm,4,2015-10-04
A tiny hole in the wall ice cream shop that delivers big on flavour  Bang Bang has been known for their long line ups  amazing ice cream sandwiches and a variety of ice cream flavours and they did not disappoint    I went on a rainy weekday afternoon and there was no line up  The staff were very courteous and let us sample the ice cream before we decided on which one we got  I would highly recommend sampling the ice cream and stepping out of your comfort zone because the flavours are very unique and you should definitely take advantage of some of the more  out there  flavours since its not something you can normally find  They do have traditional flavours as well if you re not as adventurous such as Chocolate  Coffee  Toffee etc   My top picks  London Fog  Beer n  Brownbread  Cherry Miso   I got a half ice cream sandwich on the RoCocoa cookie with the London Fog ice cream  Personally  I felt like the cookie and ice cream would taste better eaten separately and would order ice cream in a cone cup next time and skip the cookie  The ice cream is the clear star of the show because its super creamy and it just tastes really  really good    I will definitely be visiting again  the ice cream flavours rotate so there s always going to be something new to try ,5,2017-03-03
It was a really good experience  I went in middle of August  knowing that it was very popular the line up was very long  it took about    minute wait around  pm  No seats inside to eat your ice cream but it was worth the wait  There was many different flavours to choose from  ones that you do not normally see at regular ice cream shops  Ice cream was very rich and thick  I tired their london fog ice cream cookie sandwich  a half size  Cookies were big you can expect to pay at least    and up    Staff was very friendly and the atmosphere of the place was definitely hipster  Brought a warm welcoming feeling  I would definitely recommend if you are in the area ,4,2016-10-23
I dropped by Bang Bang on a weekday winter afternoon  There was no lines  There was no one really but me and the ice cream  The legendary best ice cream in Toronto   So many different unique flavours  The nice staff let me try a few  and in fact I do want to try them all   I already set my mind on Totaro since I love ube and everything purple   A scoop of Totaro in a puff         was just so so deliciously good  The ice cream has such intense flavour and I felt like I was in somewhere tropical just for the moment    The puff was buttery and tasty   Would I have lined up for    minute for this  Probably not  So I better come back to get some Bang Bang before the crowd shown up again  I would eat ice cream as good as this in the depths of winter ,5,2017-02-13
Really cool atmosphere  Service is great and everyone was really friendly and excited about the brand  taking time to explain things and let us try flavours  With vast number of unique flavours  the cookie dough flavour was made with a lemon cookie and it was so good  and really cool options like the Hong Kong style waffle or the ice cream sandwiches  I totally think everyone should try Bang Bang at least once  Only downside was that    seems like a lot for an ice cream on a Hong Kong style waffle ,4,2016-04-01
Waited roughly    minutes for a HK style waffle and Beer Ice cream   Not sure if i would have waited longer than that  Great waffle  great ice cream  Would only return if the line wasn t so long   Mediocrely priced too ,4,2015-08-16
My favourite ice cream with egg waffle spot   I always go to bang bang because their ice cream favours do not disappoint  My favourite is there mango pudding ice cream  because the warm sticky rice pudding taste so good with the mango ice cream  Also love the fact they have vegan options  so to all the lactose intolerant people  they got you covered  Very friendly customer service as well  You won t spend more than     on one item so it is very affordable  not saying you won t spend more than      cause honestly it s so amazing you d want seconds   Overall this is my    place to get ice cream with egg waffles and a must go for everyone   ,5,2018-06-03
It was fine  I had the ice cream sandwich but the cookies were just bland and the ice cream was also just ok  I won t be going all the way out to Trinity Bellwoods and stand in line for this ,3,2017-12-31
Ive driven by this place countless times throughout the summer and there was always a massive line up of about a hundred people going down the street towards Queen  But Today I drove by with my wife and there was no line up  So we had to go in today since there was no one there     My wife had one waffle ice cream she said it was the best she s ever had even better than the one at the CNE which has always been her favourite  I had the Mint ice cream  and it was great  Also got some cookies they were very good we got peanut butter and chocolate chip they were very good   This place looks very nice   We met the owner  she was very lovely ,4,2015-11-20
I d heard and seen so much about bang bang and finally had the chance to try it last night  It was most definitely NOT overrated  My boyfriend and I loved it  I d heard and seen the giant line ups but was lucky enough to have to encounter them which is great because we had a hard time deciding what to get  We finally decided  I got the Totaro  ube and coconut  in an egg waffle which was amazing  I was a little worried the egg waffle wouldn t be up to snuff but even my bf who was raised in HK said it was good  The icecream was really nice  flavours were perfect  not too sweet but not bland either  My bf had the chocolate peanut butter cookie icecream in a puff pastry and loved it  Overall our experience at bang bang was amazing and can t wait to go back ,4,2016-06-24
Been here a few times for the ice cream sandwiches and although delicious  I found the cookie   ice cream combo a little too sweet for my taste  I made a stop after dinner last night and the Totaro intrigued me so I decided to get a scoop of that  It was SO good   It s such a great balance of taro and coconut with neither overpowering the other  You get an initial taro taste with an ending rich coconut flavour  Had to share with the hubby but we both wished we had gotten our own after  The lines can be a little long though so be prepared to wait a bit ,4,2015-10-26
It s a small shop  and it opens quite late in the day  at  pm   going their early  it was a hide and seek to find the small shop because their is no sign  just a small sign on the window  so it might be a challenge to find when its not open  but other than that it was a good place to grab a cool snack,4,2014-08-14
I m not sure that it was worth my     mins of wait for this overpriced ice cream sandwich       pm on a Tuesday night   The service was slow  but good   The ice cream was good   but I wouldn t go again with that line   They have a good variety of flavors tho ,3,2015-05-30
I biked downtown to try this place on the weekend  The weather was amazing and I had a major ice cream craving  I got to the little cute stop  with a line up of about    people  There were only   people working there  but the wait wasn t long  At the front of the store the ice cream flavours of the day were listed  and they were handing out samples of their freshly baked cookies  I got the everything cookie  oatmeal base  peanut butter chips  dark chocolate chunks  pretzel pieces  dates  etc  stuffed with     chocolate peanut butter chocolate ice cream and     burnt toffee  The guy even charged me for     a cookie but gave me a whole one  I could only manage to eat the half  It was so filling but SO completely delicious  The soft warm gooey cookie combined with the rich fresh ice cream was a winning combo  The chocolate pb ice cream had huge chunks of real pb  and the burnt toffee had chewy crunchy pieces of toffee  I was so satisfied and I can t wait to go back  Next time I will try the london fog in between a french macaron  YUM ,4,2014-07-15
I came here on a Saturday     mins before it opens at  pm  and there was already a line up  I ve heard great things about this place with their variety of unique flavours  it s very hyped   I got the tataro  two of my favourite flavours  coconut and purple yam  in a cup        That s actually a lot of ice cream  For me  half of it is good to satisfy my sweet tooth  My ice cream has a gooey consistency with great flavour and colour  though every now and then I d get a crunch of little ice pieces  After half  I needed a different texture and I see why the cookie sandwiches are so popular   I tried the toasted walnut  and to me it felt like I was eating just walnuts  didn t have any sweet or toasted flavour   I m glad they accept cash  debit and credit  though they limit to just   sample per person  It s that popular and busy  They also have no place to sit or eat your ice cream so you d have to take it down the street with you   Next time  I ll share a cookie sandwich with a friend  You can also get the ice cream in a puff  waffle or cone so there s lots of options  Great ice cream joint ,4,2017-10-27
Bomb diggity  Cookies are soft and ready for eating  We scored and got here when the line wasn t long ,5,2017-05-28
It s OK     definitely not worth the wait  Got the Bang bang waffles with London fog and totaro  It was good but not to the extend for an hour wait   ,1,2016-06-25
It was ok  I got over baked cookies  birthday and everything  and they were delicious  however the cookies were softer than the chocolate cookie I got with my mint ice cream  It was really crunchy and I couldn t bite into it  The chocolate chip in the mint ice cream was really good   My husband made the mistake of the cookie ice cream combo he got and really hard it  Would have been nice to be warned  But the oatmeal blueberry cookie had a weird texture like a chewy granola and melted apart  As well as only one blueberry on there  So just a chewy mushy mess of a cookie  Also not good for a sandwich  And then he got a lychee sour cherry thing  It just was a bad mesh  He should have sampled the ice cream first  I tried the cookie too and it was not good  Especially horrible with the ice cream combo  Should have been warned  There wasn t a line so we could have spent time being warned   But still said as to why my cookie was so hard when they sold cookies that were  too hard  for a sandwich ,3,2017-10-05
The cookie design was cute and there were many flavours to select from  Did enjoy the ice cream overall  The line up is pretty long though  with additional wait time if you were getting a waffle cone ,4,2017-10-11
I feel like Bang Bang has become less efficient in recent time with its growing popularity  It s like when you go to a bar and the bouncers keep a line outside to make it seem like it s popping  even though the place is empty inside  Observing casually at the staff working behind the counter  you can tell there are many improvements that can be made  I asked for a sample of the coconut mango ice cream and the girl had to go to the back to get it  This place could definitely make more money if the company paid an efficiency expert to assess their operations   physical space    On another note  the coconut mango is delicious  There is sticky rice in the ice cream and it tastes like real Thai mango sticky rice but in ice cream form  it s my new favourite  Bang Bang is still hands down the best ice cream in the city  Those hipsters and Instagrammers waiting for charcoal ice cream have got it all wrong  Bang Bang is where it s at even if they make you wait for it ,4,2018-05-14
They have a generous amount of flavour of ice cream to choose from and there are different ways to eat it  with cookies  HK style waffle or puffs  Service is good but line up is crazy especially in the evening and weekends  If you do not want to wait too long  do come in the earky afternoon with less traffic  Overall it s all good ,5,2015-09-03
I am a big fan of Bang Bang  Bang bang offers ice cream in cones  cups  waffle cones and ice cream sandwiches  I had the everything cookies sandwich with double chocolate and peanut butter icre cream and it was delicious  The line ups can be crazy so try to go during the week  The line is also longer if you order a waffle cone  I highly recommend it  you won t be disappointed  ,4,2015-06-15
Saw the extra long line and had to find out what everyone was waiting for   Build your own ice cream sandwich is a pretty awesome concept  so we waited for about    minutes to try one   I got a ginger cookie filled with burnt toffee and vanilla   The ice cream was great   but the cookie hardened  and it was very difficult to eat   Also    for half a cookie sandwich  I m glad I tried it  but I wouldn t wait in that line again ,3,2014-07-14
Best ice cream I ve had in my entire life and that s saying a lot  Enough said  You can get many options  Just a plain cookie  and by plain I mean amaaaaazing  or a half ice cream sandwich or a full  I also heard about a waffle  not a waffle cone  with ice cream  The place is small so you might end up waiting in line for up to an hour in the summertime but I m telling you it s worth the wait  Recommend to all ,5,2015-12-31
This has got to be my favourite ice cream shop in Toronto  and I ve been to my fair share   Every time I ve gone  there hasn t been that long of a line    All of the ice cream flavours I have tried were amazing and you can t find them elsewhere  I typically get the half cookie ice cream sandwich  but honestly the cookies aren t anything extraordinary  The HK style egg waffles are pretty good though  If you go  you must try the london fog ice cream  you won t regret it ,5,2016-10-31
There s only one problem with Bang Bang Ice Cream  and it s the fact that I can t cram more ice cream into my mouth at once  That  and no seating  But it s worth braving the line  even in the cold  Cookies and ice cream are the sexiest couple I ve ever met  I want them to hook up every day  Sometimes ice cream cheats and gets into a waffle or snuggles with a puff  but the OG pairing is my favorite  I ve almost filled up a card for a freebie  That s how hung up I am    Fuck  I m probably going again tonight  It s all I can think about  And the craving will only intensify once I smoke a bit  Burnt toffee  here I come  ,5,2017-03-09
Is there a better ice cream joint than this one  I don t think so  The place keeps bringing me back for a different flavour  Cool place in a chic area ,5,2018-09-18
Having visited Bakerbots  I was looking forward to trying Bang Bang    Arrived around      pm on Wednesday night  there was a line up but the line up didn t take too long  On one side of the wall  they have a banner of ice cream flavours and on another banner  they had the cookies and other items to sandwich the ice cream  It was a little confusing to choose the flavours because they didn t have all the flavours listed on the banner  only the ones that were labelled on the ice cream tubs against the wall behind the cash  There was no price list displayed but we figured it was about the same as Bakerbots  Turns out it was a little pricier    I ordered the London Fog on birthday cookie  which was pretty good  I also tried the cinnamon toast and nocciola ice cream from my friends  Their flavours were tasty too  Service was friendly and quick    Bang Bang had a number of options for sandwiching your ice cream  ex  cookie  macarons  profiteroles  hong kong bubble cake  etc    For a basic ice cream cookie sandwich though  you get the same thing as what you would at bakerbots for a little more  about    cents to    more depending on the size  ,4,2014-06-12
The London fog ice cream is my favourite  I like the flavour offered and the yummy cookies they have  I think it s worth the line up ,5,2017-05-04
      June      My first experience was only a couple of months ago but I forgot to write a review  I went on a weekday around  pm and there was no line up which is always a plus  I got the Totaro and London Fog and let s just say I wanted a second helping right after  So rich in flavour and I made sure to definitely come back to try other flavours    August      The second time I went there was a huge line up  I went on a Sunday afternoon and I waited in line for about an hour  I got Avocado which was super creamy and smooth and Mud which consists of espresso  almonds and fudge  I got it in a HK waffle cone which was warm and delicious  It was really good and the flavours were strong  especially Mud  until I got to the end where the ice cream melted into a puddle and it was messy  I ll try it in a cookie next time ,4,2015-09-10
This place has so many delicious and creative flavors of ice cream  You gotta visit once  It s quaint and you ll definitely satisfy your ice cream craving  Love going here   goodtimes,5,2018-01-03
Flavours are amazing  I always get a half ice cream sandwich because it s a lot  even if you re ambitious  Not a lot of space to sit but there is park nearby and a few benches outside  I got the cinnamon toast and everything cookie  so good ,5,2016-03-23
Pretty disappointed  The servers totally missed asking my order and went to the person after me  When I gave my order to the cashier  he definitely had a major attitude when I asked for a cookie  He used his bare hands to grab it into a bag  VERY disgusting  Overall  very disappointed ,1,2017-08-21
Bang Bang  Friendly service and innovative ice cream sandwiches  not to mention the catchy business name    We joined the line up around     PM and thankfully the line moves quick because it was freezing outside  Like Bakerbots  BangBang do not offer too much seating   most customers were seated on the side bench or just on the sidewalk    Despite the long queue  the staff was very patient with me  allowing me to try their different ice cream flavours before making my decision on what two scoops to put into my Hong Kong style waffle cone  I tried the Bellwood Stout and it tasted like it came fresh out of the brewery  I ended up choosing Avocado and PB   J flavours ice cream    The peanut butter ice cream had the perfect amount of  jelly  in it and was AMAZING  I tried the vanilla bean flavoured ice cream inside the Everything cookie  but like all cookie sandwiches I had a hard time eating it without the whole thing falling apart  The Hk waffle cone is so much easier  less messier  to eat and definitely worth the   minute wait    Other sandwich options are macarons  profiteroles or you can simply order ice cream in a cup  I ve yet to try the London fog flavored ice cream everyone raves about so I ll definitely be back ,4,2014-10-19
Yummy  Even on a Friday night  the line was fairly long  We waited around    minutes to order  My bf and I ordered the Totoro flavor  ube  and the London Fog  earl grey  flavor   The London fog was light but flavorful and creamy and delicious  The ube flavor was good  not too overwhelming of the taro  but just right   It s a must go if you re around the area ,5,2017-04-18
Great selection  friendly service  and their vegan ice cream is pretty good  You can t really go wrong here ,4,2018-12-01
Long line up but worth trying  it has a lot of different flavour  like avocado  cinnamon  etc    you can add cookies  cinnamon buns  etc  I tried the totaro  purple potato with coconut  in a cone  taste is average  but prob will come back to try other flavour  My friend tried the cinnamon bun with cinnamon ice cream  he said it s very good ,4,2018-08-03
The best ice cream I had in city Toronto so far ,5,2017-08-21
I love this place so very much    The cookies are to die for and they have such an amazing selection that they bake fresh every day  Then there is the ice cream of course  Such cool flavours as taro and butter beer  corn on the cone and London Fog    I highly recommend you also take advantage of the free toppings they have sneakily tucked away on the shelf also  Just ask for them   Don t forget they sell pints to go and preamble favourite sandwich combos pre made ,5,2017-11-28
Gone are the days of boring vanilla and chocolate flavours  not that those aren t good   if you are looking for something different then Bang Bang is definitely the place  Not only are their ice cream sandwiches extremely photogenic according to Instagram photos but they are also pretty delicious to boot  I came here with a friend a while back and somehow we were able to miss their notorious long lineup  so no wait was necessary  The service was wonderful  the cashier asked whether it that was my friend waiting with me  Not only was she friendly but she  ended taking both of our orders at the same time  making the process much more fast  When we arrived there were no line but we noticed a huge line forming behind us by the time we got our orders    It was definitely difficult to decide on the flavour we wanted as there were so many interesting ones to choose from  I got the half  Everything Cookie with a scoop of London Fog and Avocado  The Everything Cookie was delicious on its own but paired with the ice cream while delicious  was just a bit too sweet for me  The cookie was the perfect texture  chewy with a bit of bite to it  Now on to the main thing  the ice cream  the Avocado ice cream taste like a really creamy and rich avocado milkshake  Being a lover of avocado of avocado of all sorts I absolutely loved it   The London Fog ice cream was just the strangest thing  somehow they were able to get the London Fog taste just right  You know how in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Violet Beauregarde was able to chew gum that taste like blueberry pie and ice cream  well that was what it was like  It felt like drinking a cup of London Fog except of drinking it  I was eating ice cream   As someone that has some form of lactose intolerance  it definitely has to be pretty good to get me to eat some ice cream  Definitely one of those places that makes me crave and want to try every flavour of ice cream ,5,2015-10-29
On a warm summer day  there was a line  But it was worth the wait  The staffs were friendly and the treat itself  well     It was an excellent treat  Well with the parking and time ,5,2015-10-10
First review in Toronto  Canada  My cousin took me here and first thing you will notice is the line  So this place is pretty popular and gets busy  The line is on the street walk and trust me  it can get line  As for the ice cream  I decided to get the     sammie which is ice cream and   half cookie sandwiches   If that makes sense  I ordered the rocky roadkill ice cream and it was yummy  The only thing is that the ice cream was sweeter then I thought  I love sweets but I just thought the ice cream was on the more sweeter side  As for the cookie  I ordered the oatmeal raisin and OMG    it was the best oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever had  It was baked perfectly and wasn t that sweet  Overall  this was a good spot to try if you love ice cream and baked goods  Price is decent  My order was      CAD  Great place to try and hangout with friends ,4,2018-09-15
So I waited in the massive line  The line doesn t go by fast  But when you get to the counter they don t rush u  Customer service was excellent  They run out of waffles when I went so boo to that  I had the cookie with London fog  Which was yummy  A must try   ,4,2015-10-25
I ve been to bang bang several times and nothing truly blew me away to write a review      until now       Lychee with raspberry curd n rosewater on a dark chocolate cookie   no need to say more   ,4,2015-08-21
Came here with my friends and it honestly it isn t worth the hype  Don t get me wrong its a very cool place and the icecreams and cookies taste good but it isn t amazing  I got the full ice cream sandwich w  the  everything cookie and burnt toffee icecream and when I say sugar attack I mean sugar attack  It was super sweet so watch out  I didn t even finish mine so it was sort of a waste of      but I guess it s a good place if you have a sweet tooth and live in the area because if you don t I don t think it s worth the travel and waiting in line time  Right when I got my sandwich it started melting right away and literally became soup in    seconds so start eating it right away unless you want a sticky mess  Basically to sum it up if you re in the area try it  but if you aren t don t try it  you re not really missing out on anything  The only thing that was great about this experience was the cute store beside it lol,3,2015-07-20
Love this place   Although I gotta mention the place is loosing a lot of money  customers are not paying and are getting loads of free food and the staff aren t very attentive    The line up to order is on the right hand side of the store and once you order you have to step to the left to pay but my friend and I ordered the ice cream waffle and were asked to wait to the side  So we waited and while waiting we noticed that almost half the people who also ordered the waffle before us did not pay and just took the food and left  When we knew our order was next we asked to pay and the girl at the cash surprisingly asked  oh  Did you order   And we proceeded to pay while people just took the food and left   Keep in mind that we were there for about    minutes  so we had an idea of how unorganized the place is considering the line in general wasn t that long  Just the wait for the waffle was long    Would go back for sure  Just wanted to let the staff know that they are loosing so much money ,5,2016-04-26
Unless you are a tourist or don t mind lines  go at OFF times  it s small inside and gets really busy  the line is annoying   This section strip of Toronto has changed vastly   It s a great area to check out  you should have seen it a decade   ago  couple vietnamese restaurants  washing machine repair shops  heroin addiction and street prostitution   much to like about Ossington   The ice cream was excellent  the signage is POOR  the order here and pick up sign are hard to see  first time   no debit  lame   just cc and cash   Made fresh in the shop  terrific treats ,4,2017-03-06
Went here on a Friday night at around  PM  and did not have a wait at all  My went with two other people  and we all got the hk waffle cone and managed to get it in less than    minutes each  I enjoyed the London fog  and burnt toffee  I also tried the hazelnut  and the chestnut matcha which were good as well  I especially enjoyed the consistency of the hazelnut  it almost red tasted like gelato   Although it was nice to try the hk waffle  I didn t think it was too special  and I would rather just get a cookie instead in the future  I would have been disappointing if I had to wait    minutes for it  like other reviews said  I do plan on coming back  and trying the cookie and taro ice cream,4,2015-09-12
Bang Bang is located about a   min walk from Queen and Ossington along Ossington  In my opinion  it is the best place for ice cream and ice cream sandwiches in Toronto hands down  Every time I crave for ice cream in the summer  this is the place I go to  From their unique ice cream flavour combinations to the customization of your own ice cream sandwiches  Bang Bang is worth the wait on a hot summer s day  The staff are also friendly and attentive while they make your order  My go to order is definitely the captain p nut cookie with London Fog ice cream   Definitely the place to go to for ice cream in the summer  ,5,2018-08-07
Who doesn t love ice cream  Even better when it s really good ones too   came here for a GNO night after dinner  To our surprise  there wasn t a line up   We were so lucky    I got the   BURNT TOFFEE FLAVOUR   ICE CREAM SANDWICH Amazing  They have little toffee bits within the ice cream that makes it even better     The ice cream sandwich makes it easier to eat because they put it in a little container   not as messy   My friends  also tried the   LONDON FOG   BURNT TOFFEE FLAVOUR ICE CREAM IN EGG WAFFLE CONE I was already super stuffed from my own ice cream sandwich so I didn t try the other girls  ice creams    but here are some testimonials    AWESOMENESS  DELICIOUS  UNSTOPPABLE    Thanks Cee    LOL   The egg waffle cone was a perfect paring with Bang Bang s unique ice cream flavour  The cone itself was sweet  slightly soggy and soft but still held up as we devoured it bubble by bubble     Thanks Crystal    ,4,2015-06-11
Yum   This place is so good  Bring a quality friend to pass by the hour long wait  or bring a few    Doesn t even matter if they re really good friends  as long as they let you try their flavours  because there s no way you could visit this place enough to try them all  Word to the wise  Full sandwiches are damn hefty  two full cookies     half is manageable ,5,2015-08-12
Wow  This a pleasant treat on a Friday night  I had the almost everything cookie  which happens to be gluten free   God bless you guys    My cookie was perfectly layers with the PB and concord jelly ice cream and the chocolate and PB crisp  It was spectacular  The PB and Jelly ice cream is unlike anything I have had before and I have tried pretty much every boutique and other ice cream place in the city  It was great  I highly recommend it  The staff is super friendly too  It is worth standing in line for ,5,2014-06-02
I had somewhat of a disappointing experience at Bang Bang  I ve heard rave reviews for the past couple months and was really excited to try the bubble waffle cone  I had only found bubble waffles at Pacific Mall so I was thrilled that they offered it    We arrived around      pm and had to wait about    minutes to order  I got the London Fog and Chocolate  I liked that they give you two scoops in a single   The ice cream itself was average but I liked that they had a wide variety of options with interesting flavours   That said  they told me it would be a    minute wait for a bubble waffle cone     minutes   In my mind  ice cream should be a quick and easy mission  I am not interested in waiting around for    minutes  especially not when my friends already had their orders  I opted for a sugar cone instead but was annoyed that they expected me to wait over    minutes in total for an ice cream cone    If you re in the neighbourhood  I do think it s worth a try but be prepared to wait ,2,2017-08-10
What an indulgent treat   A friend and I came here for an evening treat and we both ordered a half cookie sandwich  which was still pretty big  I had a chocolate cookie with lemon meringue ice cream  and he had the oat and date cookie with strawberry ice cream  Totally yum  It was really tasty  but it s a really big portion even at the half size  so I got kind of sick of it towards the end  The ice cream was delicious and the flavours really stood out  especially in the lemon meringue  The strawberry ice cream had what looked like real strawberry puree in it  so that was a great surprise and really affected the taste positively  All components  cookie and ice cream  were awesome and fresh and high quality  though I think next time I think I ll share the half sandwich with a friend    There are other options like the Hong Kong waffle  or French macaron sandwich  which are cool and interesting  Maybe I ll try those next time  It s a bit pricey at        before tax  per half sandwich  and other treats at    to     ish  But it s a fun place to indulge once in a while  if you can stand the long line up ,4,2014-08-04
awesome ice cream and was fortunate that i only had to wait like    minutes in the summer   definitely go if you re in the area,5,2016-12-27
We both got double scoops with waffle  The waffle was pretty good but I had a higher expectation of the ice cream  I had the mango pudding and burnt toffee  The mango pudding scoop has sticky rice mixed into it that added a nice little asian touch which I loved  The burnt toffee  however  was a bit of disappointment ,4,2018-05-24
Long lines  but incredible desserts  Peanut butter chocolate combo  Do it ,4,2015-10-28
Do I even need to write a review  Have you not seen the queues outside of this place    and they re that long for good reason    A bunch of cool flavours and a bunch of cooler cookies waffles puffs to embrace your ice cream scoops    I think this is a really cool casual date spot    my boyfriend and I love to come here if we are walking in the area  or are chilling at Trinity Bellwoods or something    Great place ,4,2015-09-30
Takes way too long to get what s basically an ice cream sandwich  Couldn t be bothered to stick around after waiting     minutes ,2,2017-08-12
I have heard so much about Bang Bang and I decide to pay a visit  Two of my weaknesses  Hong Kong egg waffle   home made ice cream   Awesomeness  This combination is creative and it is something I cannot say no to  They offer some unique flavours  I tried the black tea  SJCB Espresso  and Matcha Chestnut  They met my expectation but they are a little too sweet for my taste  The HK egg waffle was not fluffy that what I use to have  Nevertheless  Bang Bang is the perfect dessert spot after dinner on the Ossington Strip ,3,2015-12-10
Artisanal handmade ice cream with a variety of unique flavor combinations is what Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery offers  We arrived at Bang Bang at around  PM on a Thursday evening on a summer day  There were a few people ahead of us in line  The sign up front said something about   taste per person when there is a line  This worried both me and my daughter since she tends to favor traditional flavors and she had a hard time deciding which flavor she wanted to try  It quickly became our turn and when the woman behind the counter asked me what flavor I wanted to try  I told her that I wanted to save my taste for my daughter  She smiled and told me  it would be fine  My daughter can try whichever flavors she wanted  I tried the vegan mango ice cream with rice   which was delicious and I quickly order an adult snack size   which was ample  My daughter tried three flavors and she got the third flavor she tried   the burnt toffee   which featured vanilla ice cream with toffee and a salted caramel sauce  She got a kids snack size in a cone  which was also ample  We were both in ice cream heaven   Just to assure you how good this ice cream was   normally  I do not eat ice cream  I find it either too sweet or too much for me to justify ordering a portion for myself  I love that they offer snack sizes because it was the perfect portion size for both me and my daughter  They have ice cream sandwiches and Hong Kong style waffle cones  but I would only get those   even the half portion of the ice cream sandwich   if I seriously was super hungry because those portions are really big for my stomach and eyes ,5,2018-07-20
This is hands down one of my favourite ice cream places in Toronto  They consistently have amazing flavours and quite a few fun combinations ranging from cookies to HK styled waffles to accompany your ice cream  My personal favourite is to get ice cream with the profiterole  it tastes a little bit like a pineapple bun  if you get the reference   They have a full wall of flavours   I ve enjoyed flavours like raspberry rosewater  avocado  or even wasabi ,5,2016-12-15
I tried this place before  hoping that the second time would live up to its hype  Today we waited in line for approximately   minutes and there was a huge line up after us  We ordered a single scoop of Thank you very Matcha and an egg waffle with two scoops of Pb n  Chocolate  We found out after we paid that the waffle would take an additional   minutes to wait  We were happy with just taking the two scoops without the waffle and no refund  The cashier made the manager come in for the refund but it didn t matter much to us because we just wanted to waffle  The uce cream was not all that great  with not much taste sweetness  Would happily go down the street for a gelato wuthout the lineup  Overall  not happy with the wait and the quality of food ,1,2015-08-03
Great little ice cream shop  Went during their first week of opening so they were extra flexible with putting different ice cream combinations and cookies together  not sure if they re still doing that now since they ve become so popular    I ve tried cookie ice cream sandwiches throughout the city and most were very sweet  BB was perfect amount of sweetness and cookie texture    Only bad thing is  the two times I ve been they did not have macron or bubble waffle  so I guess call in advance if you are planning to get those ,4,2014-07-21
So I went here after seeing all of hype and it was just alright  I m not entirely sure why this place has line ups over other ice cream places  but overall my ice cream was decent  I d come back for sure  but don t think i d wait in a line for it ,3,2015-12-12
I got so lucky this place is close to home    The wait is worth it    The egg waffle is gonna make you wait a bit longer but it s so delicious  Check out my pic of wall of flavors ,5,2018-06-02
I ve put some shameful things in my mouth over the years and I m happy to say this was definitely not one of them  I got banged in the mouth and I loved it ,5,2017-03-19
i love ice cream so visiting here is obvious  normally  there s a line up but I was lucky enough that there were only   people ahead of me for the   times I ve been here  There are so many flavours and the smell is salivating  My favourite has got to be the london fog followed by cinnamon toast  You can t go wrong getting just ice cream but I ve tried the cookie ice cream sandwich as well  and they were delicious ,5,2017-07-27
Inventive flavors  fast service  It s the perfect place for dessert if your nearby for dinner   Always worth stopping by if your in Toronto ,5,2019-02-28
Quality has dropped since opening couple of years ago  perhaps the novelty factor has worn off  Pretty much every place has the exact execution   flavours  pastries  even the jaded hipster serving staff ,3,2018-01-20
I m a huge fan of this place and would always try to stop by whenever I m in the area  To be honest I would even wait in that horrendous line during the summer just so I can satisfy myself with their delicious ice cream flavours  It s quite a small shop with no seating area   just take out  I find that during the winter months there is hardly ever a long line  which is expected  If you re craving some smooth  creamy ice cream or chewy  soft cookies or some egg waffles then definitely check this place out   Service and Environment It s a small ice cream and bakery shop that only does take out  there are no tables for you to sit in  However  I do remember them placing some chairs outside during the summer for people to sit and enjoy their ice cream  The servers are really nice and know all of their ice cream flavours very well  they also give pretty good suggestions so be sure to ask them if you re stumped on what ice cream flavour to get  Unfortunately  service here can get pretty slow especially if you re ordering the egg waffle ice cream as it takes them quite a while to cook the egg waffle on the spot    Food I guarantee you that the moment you walk into this store you will feel a rush of excitement as you stare at all of those big ice cream cans all with unique flavours  Some of my favourites are    London Fog  Tastes exactly like a milky earl grey tea    Totoro  A rich purple coloured ice cream that tastes exactly like taro     Milk tea  Literally an ice cream form of that milk tea you would order at Chatime or CoCo    Avocado  Tastes like an avocado smoothie  so yummy    Mango Sticky Rice  I don t know how they did it but it did taste like a good representation of the this traditional Thai dessert   it s basically rich mango ice cream with small chunks of delicious coconut   Unfortunately  their ice cream flavours change a lot  So there is always going to be new flavours added but some old flavours taken out  However I think they usually keep their most popular flavours    You have the choice of having your ice cream by itself  in an egg waffle or as a full of half cookie ice cream sandwich  Their version of the hong kong egg waffles is pretty good   it s more crispier in order to hold the ice cream  They also have lots of different types of cookies  their cookies are very soft  buttery and chewy    I love this place ,5,2016-03-14
Fancy ice cream sandwiches   I liked it  had the Earl Grey ice cream with a ginger molasses cookie   but you could probably make that yourself at home with fancy Haagen Dazs ice cream flavours and buying baking large cookies   The more unique offerings are the HK bubble waffle  the profiteroles  or the French macarons as the  sandwiches  since those are hard to make yourself  but they run out these items early   Unfortunately they can t offer tastings of ice cream flavours because there are too many people   The long line up really deters me from going back   It was about a       minute wait  which is long enough for me to reconsider  How badly do I really want ice cream anyway    It may be worth the wait for the more unique flavours and  sandwich  offerings assuming they are still available   There is no seating at this place at all  you just grab and go from the counter and I didn t really see a sign for the store ,3,2015-08-17
Amazing   I got the milk tea ice cream with the macaron shell  and forget the other ice cream with the birthday cake cookie  I didn t really like the cookie because it obviously for hard due to the temp change  icecream too cold  but the macaron icecream sandwich I loved    I ll be back  Highly recommend as well ,5,2015-04-25
I was so excited to try this place this weekend  The only problem  They are closed for renovations  Sad     I love ice cream   macaroons  I was dying to try their macaroon ice cream sandwich  I will probably go try Bakerbots Bakery now ,3,2015-01-14
Have been there since last summer  Their flavor is different from other ice cream shops  Waffle and puff are must try,4,2015-11-20
London Fog and Taro are my go to here  They need more waffle machines  Try to go on a gloomy rainy day and the lines are much shorter ,4,2016-06-01
Despite the long line ups and the running out of flavours  this place is definitely worth it  If possible  definitely come at an off hour   and definitely not on the weekend  But their flavours are SO fresh and also SO on point  I m appreciative of their creative options of cookies  HK style egg waffles  etc  When the lines aren t crazy  you can try some of their ice creams before diving in    Some of the favourites  vietnamese ice coffee  avocado  totaro   london fog  DELICIOUS ice cream  when in that part of the city   even when not  definitely worth the trip to ,5,2017-02-12
Awesome waffles and delcious cookes   Ice cream is good  but not great   As one other review mentioned  their flavours could be a bit bolder   However  the quality of the ice cream is still pretty darn good   I wouldn t wait more than    minutes for their desserts so I avoid the rush by dropping by a bit earlier ,4,2015-10-25
Some of the best ice cream in the city and totally worth the wait  Our group tried a few items  ice cream sandwich  waffle cone  and a cup of ice cream  All different flavors and each was better than the previous    The only downside is you may be overwhelmed with all of the deliciousness to choose from  Bang bang offers a ton of flavors  lots of choices on cookies  and toppings    When you see the line up you know people know what they are waiting for  Be sure to check this place out   hands down some of the best service and ice cream ,5,2015-06-25
Came here on Canada Day and waited over and hour in line  But got some of the best ice cream I have ever had and as a fat kid  I have had plenty      Tried  Key Lime Pie  quite tart and refreshing with crunch bits of pie crust      Cookie dough  solid ice cream base loaded with chucks of sugar cookie dough      Burnt Toffee  decision vanilla base with large chunks of caramelized sponge toffee  GREATEST ICE CREAM of all time       This place gets a   just because of how ridiculously good that burnt toffee ice cream is    PS  also tried a couple of their cookie and they were okay  I would stick to the ice cream ,5,2015-07-06
Yum   Ice cream sandwiches made to order on fresh soft cookies  Yes  please  My travel cohort and I were in Toronto for exactly    hours and our schedule just conveniently worked out so that we could enjoy a little snack before heading to the airport   We rode over here on bikes  thank you bike share   and stood on a short queue  It was an incredibly gorgeous day  and a hot one to boot  so this was the ideal treat   I asked for the nocciola  hazelnut  ice cream on a chocolate cookie  Unfortunately  there was only a little bit of hazelnut ice cream left so the girl helping me said I could pick a second ice cream flavor  I went for the chocolate hazelnut  sticking to a theme here  and it was delicious  My friend opted for the vanilla bean ice cream on the birthday sugar cookie with rainbow sprinkles  They kind of skimped on the sprinkles but it was still delicious  The lemon zest in the cookie was a lovely touch   There s some seating outside   we sat on the wicker ottoman type deals   and it s actually really comfortable and nice ,5,2014-09-29
NECTAR OF THE GODS  THEY HAVE SAM JAMES ESPRESSO FLAVOURED ICE CREAM       point off for some patchiness in ice cream blend  Some spoonfuls were bland and unflavoured  Literally iced cream  Sadness    ,4,2015-05-28
This place definitely lives up to its hype  the both times I ve been here  the lineup was ridiculous   a sat afternoon and Friday evening   The London fog seems to be a popular flavour  it tastes exactly like a London fog  except in ice cream form  It s just the right amount of sweet  and very rich and creamy   I also tried the lychee with rosewater and raspberry curds on my second visit  It was very light  and fragrant  The ingredients mixed wonderfully together  I would highly recommend the london fog and the lychee for people who want to venture out of the standard vanilla strawberry chocolate flavours   Definitely check this place out if you re in the area  its worth the quality and wait  and the prices are very reasonable ,4,2015-08-22
I was in town visiting from Boston and am SO glad that I stumbled upon this ice cream spot  I got the Big Bang waffle which was made to order and took about   mins to make  glad it was fresh   For ice cream flavors  I got lychee rosewater and matcha green tea  It was SO flavorful and delicious  Lines can get crazy long but sooo worth it ,5,2017-07-10
There is usually a line up at Bang Bang and for good reason  At Bang Bang  you can choose from a wide variety of ice cream that s made in house  Bang Bang s ice cream sandwiches are delicious   ice cream in between two freshly baked cookies    If you are not in the mood for ice cream sandwiches  you can try a Hong Kong waffle with ice cream of your choice  The waffle is made to order and can take    to    mins  but is definitely worth the wait  The flavour and texture combinations will leave you wanting more    I would recommend Bang Bang over Sweet Jesus which I found to be overrated ,4,2017-10-04
Great place  but massive line ups  It s only worth going once in a while because of that  and you need to time it well to get there when there s the least crowding   The ice cream is innovative and the cookies are delicious  They also have amazing vegan and gluten free options  better than any of the ones I ve seen in the city so far  The staff is always pleasant  which I find admirable as they serve         people per evening and probably get paid minimum wage  It seems like it is managed well and the owners have spunk  It s also quite cheap  a homemade cookie and   ice cream scoops put together only costs       Would definitely recommend ,5,2015-06-25
Great ice cream that is worth the wait   The line up looks intimidating and it usually is a      min long wait  but if you re in the area and craving dessert then this is well worth the wait   My personal favourite the Peanut Butter   Jelly ,4,2015-10-14
This place was closed for a month and on its Yelp page it said it was open  Very disappointing as we made a special trip down to try it    very unprofessional ,1,2017-01-20
Interesting little dessert store    minute drive from my place    There is a very unique selection of flavours  one of them is bound to catch your appetite  The ice cream s sweetness perfectly compliments the cookie outer or the hong kong style waffle  The cookie at times may be a little too overwhelming due to the ice cream being very sweet already  but if you can move past that the flavours really blend well with the ice cream  It s really just a really nice ice cream sandwich   Is this ground breaking  No  But I for the people searching for something more than just ice cream I d say the overall product is worth the money  It seems lately at night the lineup goes down the block  Not sure if I d wait an hour to get it  but definitely worth it if there wasn t such a big lineup ,4,2016-04-17
Just excellent  We got there right as they opened and only had a brief wait  We ordered an oatmeal and London Fog sammie and a waffle with burnt toffee and what the fudge chocolate iced cream  It was all amazing  If you re trying to live that no regrets life  get the waffle for sure  Overall  great place and would recommend this to anyone with a sweet tooth ,5,2018-07-03
Delicious  If you re in the Ossington neighbourhood you have to try them  Tons of vegan and gluten free options  and every flavour is a win ,5,2015-11-09
Good selection of flavours  This shop reminds me of Kekou Ice Cream  Some similar ice creams are better and some are slightly less delicious in terms of taste  Highly recommended place if you haven t been here already  If I am in the West side and craving ice cream then this is the first place in mind  If I am in downtown then Kekou would be the place to go ,4,2016-11-28
I ve heard about the crazy lineups that happen  and luckily I arrived on a hot day to find no line and some empty seats  A solid icecream place with options of how you want your icecream to be delivered to you either by cone  cookie  cream puff or egg waffle  Unfortunately  they only let you try one icecream flavor so arrive knowing what you want or it s a shot in the dark    I went classic with a scoop of burnt toffee in a cone  which immediately started melting and required a good    minutes of delicious damage control  Large chunks of sponge toffee are hidden within the caramel based icecream  Not sure what the burnt part of it was suppose to be  but a good icecream nonetheless  I would come back to try something else but don t know if it would be worth the stress of lining up,3,2016-06-04
tried the ice cream sandwhich   it was okay    too sweet   didnt really taste fresh authentic   if you are looking for freshly made ice cream w seasonal real ingredients you have to go to kekou  otherwise bang bang is good for funky flavors  portion size and a rich dessert,3,2016-07-11
Long line  but worth the wait    You can t go wrong with any of the flavors  The hardest part will be narrowing it down and making your final decision  If you can t decide  there s no judgement with the double fisting here  I witnessed plenty of people walking out with two cones  With these lines you definitely can t blame them  Nothing worse than regret  ,5,2015-07-13
Long line  delicious  amazing ice cream  We aren t overly patient  but the wait is definitely worth it  We waited    min on a nice summer Saturday night  The ordering process takes some decision making  but they lay it all out for you on the signs next to the door   you ll have plenty of time to decide  and the servers help out as well   On busy nights  they allow one sample per person    Tortaro is very hard to explain  but it s sort of a vanilla y  nutty flavor     Pretty good  If you like fruity tarty flavors  the Pink Lemonaid was great  The Frooty Loops left something to be desired   and once the ice cream sat for a little  the crunched up cereal just became soggy and gross inside    We really wanted waffle cones  but they told us it would be an additional    min   which didn t seem worth it after already waiting ,5,2016-07-11
This place is good  The ice cream is fresh and has some really tasty unusual flavours  I had Taro one day and it was delicious   The cookies are also quite good  It s a bit pricey but worth it for a splurge night    The only thing holding this place back from   stars is the chaos that is the front of the house staff  There is consistently a huge line  which could be tightened up even slightly by simply having some form of organization  Right now it feels like total chaos with a number of staff standing around when they could be doing something    I was recently at Earnest Ice Cream in Vancouver and the line was easily longer and moved four times more quickly because it was streamlined    I admit there have been several times in recent months  we live around the corner  that we ve decided to skip this place because we couldn t bare the wait  I don t mind waiting a bit but a one hour wait is out of the question ,4,2015-10-27
Cool spot to walk in to  grab a cool me down treat  scarf it down and continue to walk into the crazy streets of Toronto  Loved this delicious pastry and ice cream combo  So refreshing  I love the different options they have for ice cream and that you get to choose how you want it  The girl at the counter was nice too ,4,2017-02-15
Stop by here during my visit to Toronto back in March  I believe I had the London Fog and my sister had the Lychee Rosewater Raspberry  They were both good but not amazing  Ice cream is half about consistency for me and the ice cream was just a tad too creamy for my taste  The best part about Bang Bang is the staff  Everyone was super friendly ,3,2017-07-04
Good icecream  Yes  Most definitely  Is it worth the price  Meh  I don t mind dropping coin for good food but icecream is one of those things that makes my heart hurt when its more than    an order  Considering a tub of Breyer s would go on sale for        However  should you try this place  Yes you definitely should  Despite my qualms about the price I still think the icecream is delicious and unique  At least try it once  Treat yo self ,4,2019-04-13
Amazing ice cream just loved it  Celebrated hubby birthday with something delicious after lunch  definitely return  Very friendly staff and very helpful ,4,2019-06-26
I love this place  The cookies and ice cream are amazing  the only thing not to like is the eternally long line   Prepare to wait at least    minutes   It is worth it though   Bang Bang   if you are reading this  my advice is to not allow any sampling and to have some pre made items available from a separate line to speed things up  Too many times  I ve been behind groups asking a million questions and taking    minutes to make up their minds  It takes all my will power not to hurt these people  p  Reward us regulars with a quick way to get our fix ,5,2016-09-10
So good  I had the waffle cone and it was soft and chewy  I had the totaro and London fog flavours in it and it was amazing  My partner had the campfire marshmallow in an everything cookie and it was good too  My combination was way better than his though  This place is worth the drive ,5,2016-07-10
THE BEST  I hate lines but I m willing to wait for bang bang  Love the everything cookie with burnt toffee ice cream  There is ALWAYS a line here  for good reason   even when it s cold or raining    There is no seating or tables though  More of a take out joint  You ll finish whatever you order in   seconds  it s that good  so no need to sit anyway ,5,2017-07-16
So I went to this place two times within a span of four days  And my gosh is this one of the best ice cream places in Toronto   Pros    roasted marsh mellow   I could really taste the smoky flavour and it felt like eating smores but in ice cream form      cinnamon bun ice cream  disclaimer this does not have actual cinnamon bun bits unless you actually get the sammie version   I loved it since I live for the abundance of cinnamon in anything but not for those who may have reservations on this spice as my friend was so so on the flavour     London fog   one of the best tea based ice creams I ve tried   Cons   the line ups but they aren t as badnduring lunch hours and even at     pm on weekdays    location  just my own personal issue since I wished there was one closer to where I live      Would I go again    a thousand times yes ,4,2018-08-12
The totaro ice cream is to die for  It is amazingly good     The line up is crazy but definitely worth it  ,5,2016-05-23
This place is an ice cream lover s wildest dream  They offer     flavours  some classics like chocolate or matcha  other more original like avocado or London Fog  The ice cream is soft  creamy and exploding with flavour  I highly recommend waiting for a waffle cone  takes about    minutes to prepare depending on how busy it is   Alternatively  they also sell cookies and you can get a ice cream sandwich         would recommend ,5,2018-10-26
Super cute place   First off  the shop is kinda tiny  so it s best if you re just grabbing a scoop to go  Since Bang Bang is known for its egg waffles and ice cream duo  that s what I opted for  After asking the staff for recommendations  one of them said that the lychee ice cream and  totaro  were a popular combination  I took his advice and was not disappointed   Totaro is a taro ice cream  as evident from the name   It has a richer taste than store bought ice cream  which to be expected  and was generally very tasty  What really impressed me was the lychee ice cream though  I can t remember the exact name of it  but it was something like lychee   raspberry curd ice cream  The lychee is very sweet and simple  it tastes like real lychee  What truly adds and makes this ice cream unique is the raspberry curd though  The tanginess from the raspberry cuts through the lychee and creates an extra dimension for the ice cream  Really lovely   Unfortunately  Bang Bang is quite far away from me  I d love to come again to try more flavours if possible  but it d be hard finding an incentive to ,4,2016-05-18
    stars for the great flavors   WAIT  Came on a Friday night around  pm and there was no one in line or at the store    ATMOSPHERE  It s very small inside  you order at the counter and then you can sit on the one bench they have or leave   They have a huge white canvas area that is great for photos   FOOD  They have     ice cream flavors  all very unique so I recommend trying the different ones   I ended up getting just a plain scoop of the lychee rosewater because it was so refreshing   I made my husband get the     cookie sandwich so we could try that too   LYCHEE ROSEWATER   if you like rose flavored things and or lychee you will love this   It s very refreshing with a slight floral taste and has an icy texture rather than overly creamy   It was very very good   It also had chunks of almost raspberry inside   GINGER MILK   husband got this because he loves ginger and he said he had a really good icy texture and was one of the best ice creams he s had   We wanted to do the cookie so we got the     cookie option which is just   cookie broken in half and then   scoops of ice cream put in between   We got the everything cookie which was soft and chewy  despite being between   cold ice cream scoops  and had a great taste with chocolate and peanut butter   Overall  definitely loved and would recommend this ice cream for their texture and unique flavors ,4,2017-11-15
Bang Bang is appropriately named as it s the same sound my head makes as I hit it against a wall every time I hear someone rave about this place     But you can make your own ice cream sandwich and everything is homemade   Is the inevitable rebuttal to which I reply with a list of other places that do that too   Don t get me wrong everything here is tasty but by the time I get through the list of inefficiencies  hype and hipsters my blood is boiling and no amount of homemade ice cream is going to cool it down    I understand if you HAVE to try this place just once but be prepared for the long lines  always  Over an hour in the summer      minutes in the off season  If you want to avoid a line  wait for the temperature to dip below    degrees and then you can just waltz right in and shiver while you eat your treat outside   Value for Money       assuming you put a price on the time spent waiting in line    Bottom Line  it s ice cream  it s just not worth the wait and you can do better ,2,2016-05-14
I came here on a Sunday evening around  pm with a couple friends  The line was around    people long by the time we got there  Unfortunately    minutes into the line  a staff member came out to let us know they ran out of a couple flavors due to a super busy week and their waffle machine was broken  We were a little disappointed that we wouldn t be able to try the waffle but since we walked all the way there  we would stick it out and try their other items    Between the   of us  we ordered  London Fog  Chesnut w  Matcha  Orange Creamsicle  Pb n Jelly  and SJCB espresso  My friend ordered a puff and the rest of us got half cookie sandwiches  I tried The Everything cookie and the Birthday cookie  both of which were chewy and quite soft  perfect for the ice cream sandwich   My other friend got the dark chocolate cookie which was a crunchy cookie but became softer after being soaked with ice cream  The London Fog is to die for  Creamy and strongly flavored with Earl Grey  everyone in our party thought it was delicious  The chestnut with match fell a little flat with us  Although the consistency was good  the chestnut was a little bland and we barely tasted green tea  The PB n J was very good as well and we loved the little swirls of courant jelly    Overall  the ice cream selection was great  as were the cookies they had  A pity we didn t get to try the waffles     Would come again ,4,2015-07-06
Visted Bang Bang for the second time yesterday and as usual  this place never fails with the beyond exceptional taste of their ice cream  I decided to get the waffles with the lychee rosewater and the pink lemonade  Bang bang also offers strawberry waffles but I settled on the original ones  They were both very good but the lychee definitely blew me away  The staff working here were very friendly and the wait was also very quick  about   minutes   Although this place is very small and can get very crowded with just a couple people inside  Bang Bang is a place I will definitely find myself coming back to over and over again ,5,2017-02-12
Very delicious ice cream  I love the selection of flavors  The line is usually VERY long  but it s definitely worth the wait ,4,2016-10-29
Not worth the hype in my opinion  A group of friends decided go try out various flavours in different orders  The total flavours included peanut butter   jelly  corn on the cone  london fog  burnt toffee  key lime pie and cinnamon toast crunch   The ice cream was not high quality  and it seemed like they just threw on cereal and other ingredients to get the flavours   For example  corn on the cone was just corn pops in ice cream    For the line up I was under the impression this was a must have  can t miss foodie spot  It was mediocre  Nothing too far off from your regular Marble Slab   Still better than Patois Restaurant though ,3,2015-07-18
Nothing special about the ice cream  They have some interesting flavours  However  it s the cookie    ice cream combo that makes things great   Lines are too long however ,4,2015-08-09
Delicious  Loved my ubi toro ice cream and my date s chocolate hazelnut ,5,2015-10-27
There was an insane line    but it was worth every minute of the wait   The espresso ice cream was amazing  But the real put it over the edge treat was the insanely delicious ginger cookie   Maybe next time I ll try one of the waffle cones that looked and smelled so divine  or maybe I ll just order a dozen of those delectable cookies ,5,2016-06-14
Very tasty ice cream sandwich  My favourite is London fog on everything cookie  Don t forget to get your stamp card  Be prepared this place can be very crowded ,5,2015-12-23
Delicious dessert  but I wouldn t suggest waiting in that line for it  If you happen to go by and there s no line  then yeah go  But you can find so many similar places around the city with smaller lines  I m a huge fan of all their cookies  Their ice cream flavours and kind of interesting and weird  but good if you like that  ie earl grey  red bean  etc ,3,2016-08-07
So worth the wait  Anyone who says that Bang Bang is a novelty has not experienced their delicious gelato  I love the uniquely flavoured gelato paired with gourmet pastries  Service was fast and efficient  My favourite gelato flavour would have to be the Totaro  It s just the perfect amount of sweetness and goes oh so well with the birthday cake cookie  The photo I ve posted is the Totaro and dulce de leche with the  everything cookie   Seriously   this place is so worth the hype ,5,2018-05-20
The ice cream was delicious  I tried the totoro  purple yam  and London fog on a HK style waffle  The ice cream was so rich and smooth  The flavour was so great  Such strong tastes  You could actually tell what flavour they were  Didn t taste fake at all   However  I was a bit disappointed with the HK style waffle  It didn t really taste authentic  The paste they used was of a good consistency  It was lacking the egg flavour that traditional HK style waffles offer  It was just missing that little more egg taste then it would have been perfect  But other than that   I can t wait to be back to try more flavours  The roasted marshmallow is on my list to try    The waiting wasn t too long     minutes on a Sunday  If you get the egg waffle cone it ll take a bit longer to wait  Seems like they were missing one more person as a cashier  The cashier was making the waffle cones and trying to cash people out   Which took a bit more time  It ended up slowing down the line    Will be back   ,4,2015-09-01
We ordered the ube and green tea ice cream wrapped in the egg waffle  The ice cream was delicious and the egg waffle was a perfect consistency  It was my first time trying the egg waffle and it was nice and crisp  I wish I had more time to try out more of their flavors ,4,2017-01-05
Make your own ice cream sandwiches    Do I need to say more  There are long lines  even in the winter  but it is SO worth the wait  I had the Earl Grey tea ice cream with the     ginger molasses cookie    Probably not the best combination on my part but both super delicious on their own  My boyfriend ordered the burnt toffee ice cream on a waffle cone which was made fresh right on the spot  I m definitely going back soon because Im dying to try the macaroons as cookies  They also have a great variety of unique flavors that you can t find anywhere else   like cinnamon toast crunch ice cream  omg yum    which is also on my list to go back and try ,4,2015-05-08
Line was out the door but it moved fast and was well worth the wait  I got two scoops  vegan vanilla bean and rocky roadkill  in a waffle cone  The cone was made fresh so it was warm and chewy with just the right bit of crunch  The bottom scoop melted into the waffle cone s ridges and all the flavors came together in glorious harmony  Good number of vegan and gluten free options offered  One of the greatest ice cream experiences of my entire life ,4,2015-08-02
I gave this place a  nd try since the ice cream was very rich in flavour but tried diff flavours this time and hands down it is the best ice cream bar in Toronto    This time I tried the Hk waffle again plus peanut butter and jelly and chocolate ice cream  This time the Hk waffle was soft and warm like how I like it and the ice cream was oohhh so amaazingggg   The ice cream is very rich in flavour and true to the food flavour  I think every time I go to bang bang I will get the peanut butter and jelly ice cream  It s my new fav     ITS A MUST TRY  ,5,2015-07-10
Fantastic place to finish to any dinner on the Ossington Strip  The waffle cone is a true  freshly made waffle   and great selection of both eclectic and delicious in house ice cream flavours ,5,2016-03-24
Like their elder sibling  Bakerbots  this place is addictive  Lots of ice cream options but the cookie selections are meager  Nonetheless  they still make the perfect ice cream sandwich  The cookies are buttery and crispy so they can holdup to that delicious ice cream  The ice creams are made in house with fresh ingredients and cream  All the flavours are honestly great and I haven t really had any that is confusing or bad   Their specialty egg waffle cone is definitely a delight  Albeit the portion is huge and you will probably struggle to finish this thing even though it s amazing good  You know it s great when you see places up in Markham  where egg waffles are abundant  copying this stuff   With the exception of the huge lineups I really have no complaints  One of the best scoops of ice cream you can get in this city  My go tos are London Fog  Mint  Avocado and burnt toffee  Looking forward to trying many many other great flavours   when the weather warms up a bit   D,5,2016-02-10
I m really non judgemental when it comes to ice cream  I like all ice creams    well  there are a few exceptions  but the Bang Bang ice cream waffle is definitely the top on my list    How can you resist double scoops of small batch ice cream on a freshly made Hong Kong waffle   They are amazing on their own already  The fluffy  eggy and warm waffle that s crisp on the outside and soft inside  The taro and black tea ice cream that was creamy  velvety and flavoured in the point    I m so happy that I don t live close to Bang Bang  otherwise I ll be having this daily  p,5,2015-11-11
I love love love their Taro ice cream  It s definitely worth the long line up  Highly recommend this place ,5,2016-01-27
Service  The staff was fast and friendly  and was really helpful in explaining the flavours    Ambiance  It s a really small shop  and not much space for seating  This is one reason why the line tends to pile up   Food  Despite the new flavour of ice cream and cookie combinations  at the end of day  it s only an ice cream sandwich  I gave it a     due to the fact it s not worth the       min wait  depending on the day you go ,3,2016-10-06
AMAZING DELICIOUS   Definitely coming back  Im actually drooling thinking about it  I got the london fog  earl grey  icecream on the everything cookie  who knew a tea icecream could actually taste like tea and delicious and sweet  Mmm   My friend got the rocky roadkill which was super chocolatey and and delicious as well    Took off one star because the additional wait for a hong kong waffle is super long    i could get those so quickly in china town  ,4,2015-06-06
Bakerbots is on Ossington  sweet  I dream of the ice cream sandwich at this place  Love  love  love ,5,2014-05-31
We made this a priority stop during our trip to Toronto and was not disappointed  As soon as we arrived  there was a line out the door and down the sidewalk   We waited about       minutes to place our order  and an additional    minutes for our  Big Bang Waffle   which is there version of a Hong Kong Bubble Waffle and is made fresh for each order placed for one  They have two waffle makers  so if they are really busy  that cone could take a bit  but we felt it was totally worth the wait   I got the Totaro and the Bees Knees   both tasted fresh and handmade   and a great combination   both sweet and delicious   They have tons of of different unique flavors amd offer vegan options  as well   Happy we were able to stop by this ice cream place during our stay here in Toronto ,4,2018-05-17
Their vegan dark chocolate ice cream is what dreams are made of  Smooth  creamy and delicious dark chocolate flavor  Their cookies were soft and chewy there is also lots of variety  If you are not a cookie fan  they also have Hong Kong waffles and ice cream buns  For a full cookie with ice cream  it costs     but you can also order half cookies  Overall  the service was quick and efficient  Yes  there is always a line but I thought it moved quickly  Perfect treat for a summer day  I hope to come back soon ,4,2017-08-01
Ohhhh  this place always has a line up but don t be fooled  I am simple when I order ice cream or gelato and stick to the usual suspects without needing to go overboard with samples  Yet  when my go to flavours are consistently  meh   it causes me to wonder how this place got to be so popular  Then I remember us humans are easily beguiled  especially when such a place exists that cashes in on novelty  for the Instagram though   looks yummy and there is seemingly much variety  Ice cream spotting is basically a summer sport for Torontonians  so a place that caters to  most  of the senses wins out  but you guys  taste is king   At any rate  my other theory could be true  people just love lining up in this city ,2,2017-08-25
Cute summertime ice cream place  It gets super busy but the ice cream and cookies are awesome ,4,2018-03-28
Incredible  and very creative  ice cream  cookies and waffles   long lines though  Should be the start of a chain ,5,2015-07-25
Get there when they open  Small place HUGE flavours  Great ice cream   cookies  Huge portion cookie ice cream sandwich  They serve you quickly ,5,2019-09-05
Swung by at  pm on a HOT Thursday afternoon   It was pretty quiet  few people in front of us   but after we ordered  it got real busy  Staff is nice and helpful  Orders take a bit longer than a normal ice cream parlor as they re creating your order on demand   We ordered the lychee rose water ice cream  and the vegan mango rice pudding ice cream   Both were VERY flavorful  delicious  and not too sweet   This is some of the best ice cream we ve ever had   Cookies were delicious  but not necessary   the start of the show is the ice cream   Price point is very fair   SO GOOD ,5,2018-07-05
Great little ice cream shop with delicious treats  Tried the toffee and dulce de leche ice cream with egg waffle and both were really good  The egg waffle was average  had better in HK but the ice cream was great ,4,2016-04-10
Had terrible customer service  We walked in at       while there was a line of people inside  and the lady quite rudely turned us away and said they could not serve us  Won t be coming back here again ,1,2018-03-24
Im not a huge fan of sweets  but Bang Bang has so many flavours from asian  taro  matcha green tra  oolong tea  to traditional smores  toffee  birthday cake and more  You can choose from just the scoops of icecream in a cup  a sugar cone  a waffle   freshly baked in house cookies  or  my personal favourite I highly reccomend  a baked profiterole pastry  its light and airy  sandwiched with your favourite flavour of icecream  Deeeeeelish  I have had the Totaro  taro   Thank You Very Matcha and the London Fog  I like how the flavours are very intense  smoooooth and creamy  I bring all my guests from out of town here  Please open a location uptown Bang Bang  ,5,2018-08-23
One of the best Ice creams in Toronto  a very interesting menu with weird  a good weird  combinations  Therefore you must try this place  The presentation is also very good as you have a wide range of choices for your  bun cone   The portions are a bit on the smaller side ,4,2017-10-20
  star for ice cream and service  I didn t really like the cookie for the ice cream sandwich  Too hard and mediocre flavour  cookie only   When you bite into it  the cookie crumbles and ice cream squishes out  The ice cream flavours are very unique and tastes fresh  You can get an egg waffle ice cream cone  but this is also not really my thing  I can understand why people would like it though  It s a change from your traditional cone  Beware of long line ups during the summer  especially when the weather is nice ,4,2016-07-27
Bang Bang s ice cream flavours are pretty bomb  unique      worth the wait  If you haven t come here yet  chances are you ll at least have already heard of this place or seen  Insta worthy  photos posted all over social media and the Internet  The store has pun full flavours pictured on their website such as Totaro  coconut   purple yam ube   not to be confused with taro    Burnt Toffee    Thank You Very Matcha but scroll down their online ice cream visuals and you ll see a list of overwhelming yuminess also served in store  They re always experimenting with new flavour combinations   also have seasonal flavours so there s a reason to want to come back   My friends and I went on a Saturday afternoon so the line up was inevitable but moved quickly  We ordered  seasonal flavour Love Oolong Time   London Fog  Burnt Toffee sandwiched between The Everything cookie  two types of chocolate  pretzels  peanut butter    oatmeal   and a new flavour of theirs   Coffee   Cigarettes  Vietnamese coffee  iribancha   smoked   green tea    bourbon  also sandwiched b w The Everything cookie   My faves are the Love Oolong Time  stronger tea flavour than London Fog which has a nice softer tea flavour  and the Coffe   Cigs  because it has a good coffee kick to it    I guess I like my caffeine   Bottom line   the ice cream flavours alone are worth the trek to Bang Bang  With unique flavours executed well   an overwhelming amount to choose from  you ll definitely wanna come back to keep trying new ones  The cookies are all right   they re on the crunchier side of cookies  whereas I prefer crispy and soft ones    The Everything cookie had a stronger than I wanted PB flavour   I need more chocolate  The other pastries  availability will depend on the day   you just gotta pop by  They didn t have the chiffon cake I wanted to try but it looks like they ll usually have an assortment of cookies and the egg waffles  which I don t know are worth it since you can find good egg waffles elsewhere   Come here for the ice cream  dress it up with a baked good if you want    definitely enjoy the very aesthetic and delicious food ,4,2016-08-15
I d say this place is pretty over hyped and over priced  Out of everything I have tried I would still recommend trying the Date oatmeal cookie  the Banana pudding Ice Cream  and the actual Hong Kong waffle cone  all of which are quite tasty  But for what I was imagining  somehow the product did not line up with my expectations   the flavors and some of the cookies were not at all what i thought they would be    i guess its more about the experience and the amount of varieties they carry than they actual flavour and quality of each taste     i wouldn t go back as I ve been there a couple times   ,3,2017-07-20
The different varieties of ice cream flavor is awesome  However  I don t think it s worth the wait for the waffle cone  There is always an outstanding line out the door  at least for the two times that I went   It s because they are making the waffle cones fresh and only have   machines to make it with  The ice cream flavors are very tasty  It s located in a fun area where you can bar hop and visit different whole in the wall restaurants  Definitely stop by if you re in Toronto ,4,2018-08-26
The ice cream taco style was a unique concept when i went here  the desert was really good too  I d be happy to go back if it wasn t so far from where i live ,4,2017-10-28
Yes it s worth the wait  Everything about this place is unique   every treat we had was superb  It gets a little crazy once you are through the doors  but hey it just adds to the fact that people love it   will fill a tiny space to get their hands on the goods  We tried the espresso paired with cinnamon toast ice cream   burnt toffee paired with oatmeal cookie ice cream sandwich  Thumbs up all around  You ll just need to eat it semi fast on a warm day evening because all the goodness will melt real quick ,5,2017-07-19
I visited Bang Bang on Saturday afternoon  There was about a    min wait  I ordered the HK waffle with london fog and golden oreo ice cream  Unlike others  I didn t like the london fog ice cream  It just had an odd taste in my opinion  However  the golden oreo ice cream was delicious and I would definitely get that again  I waited about   minutes for my waffle   Boyfriend ordered the cinnamon bun sandwich with cinnamon toast ice cream  It was small and he devoured it in about   minutes  In terms of taste  it was very delicious    I m planning on visiting Bang Bang again to try more ice cream flavours  It s worth the visit despite the long line ups  Service was okay  They were polite but the staff did not exceed my expectations ,4,2018-08-05
Toronto has so much to offer and Bang Bang Ice Cream follows suite  All housemade flavors  We got the Bang Bang Waffle with Totaro and Burt Toffee  YUM  The waffle is crispy on the outside yet soft and delicious on the inside  Totaro was a pleasantly sweet taro and the burnt toffee was so good   and the burnt toffee bits  Burnt toffee complimented the waffle nicely   The ice cream was light yet creamy and we enjoyed every bite   Warning   waffle looks more sturdy than it is so don t hold it too tight  Lol,5,2017-04-21
Addendum  Key lime pie flavour is also the best flavour in the world ,5,2018-06-29
Bang Bang always has a line up  but the wait is always worth it  It is home to some of the best homemade ice cream in Toronto  The first time I came  the wait was about    minutes and the second time I went  the line went quickly so we were in within   minutes  Both times  I tried fantastic flavours  My favourite so far is Avocado    Don t knock it till you try it ,4,2017-08-13
I love ice cream and I heard Bang Bang ice cream is a MUST in Toronto  The lines weren t to bad when I went but I can see how it can get really long since the place is pretty small in the inside  I order the     Sammie which is half of a cookie your choice and I chose fresh mint and milk and cookies  It was so good and definitely worth the hype  The fresh mint is petty much mint chocolate which is my all time favorite ice cream to get  It was so fresh and amazing  I got a chocolate chip cookie and it was really rich and soft in the inside and crisp on the out  The place isn t expensive either in my opinion  They do allow you to try samples but ask if you choose wisely as the lines are really long at times so they don t want to hold up the lines for others  I would definitely go back if I was to visit again  Thanks Bang Bang ice cream  ,5,2018-09-16
Bang Bang is famous for their ice cream sandwiches and unique ice cream flavours  Definitely try the oatmeal cookies  I think it goes with any of the ice creams they have  You can ask them to just get half a cookie if you think one is going to be too much or you want to try a second flavour combo  In the summer  always long line ups ,4,2016-02-05
I don t understand why there is so much hype around this place  The ice cream and cookies are pretty good    except the one member of our group who got gluten  and dairy free options was not impressed at all  They have creative flavors but you can find similar quality ice cream elsewhere   What a stressful and disappointing experience  We waited     minutes in line and learned that the waffles would be an extra    minute wait if we ordered them   Once we entered the small shop  the menu was difficult to read  The ordering system felt chaotic and confusing  especially with so many people packed into the shop   We grabbed our    ice cream  sammies  and those tiny plastic spoons and bolted for fresh air  Then we ate standing on the sidewalk next to a construction zone as the ice cream melted all over our hands  We walked a block down the street to find a trash can to throw away our leftovers   Suggestions for improvement    Make it easier for people to see flavor options while they re waiting in line on the sidewalk  Better yet  have a server come out and take orders from people in line     Make clearer signage on wood menu and flavor buckets   After a recommendation from a friend  I really wanted to like this place  With a few changes  I d give it another try ,3,2017-07-23
I guess I got lucky my friend was waiting in line when I got there Sunday afternoon so I only waited    min    I got the waffle cone with Thank You Very Matcha and London Fog  I really really really liked the London Fog  I suppose it s an exclusive enough a flavor to go to Bang Bang  The waffle cone was very good too   soft  tasty but not overtly sweet  The matcha was okay  I ve had better in an all you can eat sushi place   I would go back to try the nutella and the London Fog again for sure  I would buy the London Fog in a container to watch Netflix with   Not really a fan of ice cream sandwiches  but I like how they have a selection of cookies to choose from  I wouldn t line up for more than    min though ,3,2015-09-21
A ton of unique flavours coupled with various cookies for a sweet ice cream sandwich make Bang Bang is top place for ice cream in my books  Line ups will be long during the summer so be prepared to wait a bit    I ve been here a few times and haven t been disappointed yet  Recently had the Oolong and Burnt toffee ice cream which I found fantastic  The ginger cookie is also a favorite for me ,5,2016-06-05
Love Bang Bang Ice Cream   Amazing flavour selection and great options like Hong Kong waffle  or ice cream wedged between house made cookies   Try the Totaro  etc ,5,2017-08-16
Best ice cream in toronto  Worst line wait times in toronto to       but it s worth the wait    ,5,2017-08-13
I ve been here a bunch of times and each time I m here it does not disappoint   Recently my wife and I tried their seasonal flavour Ilychee Rosewater Raspberry and Burnt Toffee on a HK style egg crepe  that was freshly made to order   There are also other options such as having your ice cream in a cup  waffle cone  regular cone or ice cream sandwich  Their cookies are homemade and taste delicious  You can also just buy their delicious baked cookies separately    There are lots of different flavours and we ll definitely be back to try others  This place does get really busy at night during the summer and the line up can be out the door  Be prepared to wait in line for    mins or longer but its definitely worth the wait ,5,2019-01-20
Their ice cream sandwiches are amazing  and they have really unique and delicious ice cream flavours  The downside is that on a nice summer day  be prepared to line up for over an hour  It s obvious that they purposely try to have long lines to create hype because when you finally get into the shop  you ll notice the staff are moving at glacier pace to take and prepare orders  Worth going to once just to try  if you have time to spare ,4,2016-04-03
This place never fails me  It s a small ice cream joint that has a lot of creative flavours  I got milk tea and cinnamon toast crunch which admittedly is not a good combo but both were delicious on their own  The worker there asked if I d like tapioca with my ice cream sandwich and I told her to surprise me so she did    The ice cream flavours are very vast   they have gluten free and vegan options  Their cookie flavours are a little less variable   I believe they have around six flavours of cookies  I always go with the rainbow one  They also have other pastries for you to buy and mini tubs to take home    Sitting is small so I d suggest this place for the summer  Otherwise  much too cold in the winter  I d be surprised if they get many guests during the cold season ,5,2019-01-23
Bang Bang    What a fun name for such an amazing ice cream shop and bakery   One of my foodie friends told me about this hot new place  and I m so glad I made the trip out to Ossington last night after work  It can be tricky to find because they do not have a big  fancy storefront  but I m fairly certain you will not walk or drive by Bang Bang without wondering why there s a line up or why there s a bunch of people hanging out on benches outside the shop    There really was no line when we arrived just before      on Wednesday night  but once we got our orders and took a seat outside  the line was right up to the curb    The moment my friend and I saw Nutella Filled Puffs  we knew we had to try one  Chocolate Hazelnut ice cream was not available  so we stuffed our puff with Hazelnut ice cream instead  It was SO good  Honestly  anything with Nutella is good  But a puff pastry smeared with Nutella and filled with delicious hazelnut ice cream is quite heavenly  Surprisingly  it was not too sweet either   We also ordered half a sandwich  we chose the Everything cookie with Burnt Toffee ice cream  I was hoping the cookie would be a little softer and chewier  but the generous amount of ice cream made up for it  Ooey gooey melted toffee with chunks of honeycomb toffee in vanilla ice cream  SO good    I can t wait to go back to try their other ice cream flavours such as  London Fog  Dulce De Leche  B Day Cookie Dough  and Avocado  By the way  you can order their ice cream in a cup  cone  take away container  or in a bubble waffle even ,5,2014-07-25
I love this place and I have been here several times  Each time  the experience is good  I personally like the cream puff vs the  bubble  waffle one if eating together with the ice cream  they made the waffle fresh so it s still warm  but i just don t like having warm waffle with my ice cream     It s just me  And I also like the ginger milk flavour ice cream  So I think you should give it a try too  Cream puff with Ginger milk should be a good combination    This place is such a perfect place for me to go for dessert after I finished Pho noodles from Pho Tien Thanh restaurant which is like   min South of walking  I don t know why  maybe it s the saltiness from the Pho which makes the ice cream and cream puff here more tastier  lol    As an ice cream shop  hmmm hmmm good ,4,2016-11-08
Finally got my chance to sample their infamous ice cream sandwiches after lunch in the neighbourhood today  Came at a really good time as  luckily there was only a couple in front of me who were sampling more than one flavour   I thought score because no one was behind me  so I was able to sample more than one flavour as well    lucky me   The server was very friendly  helpful and patient as I tried the many flavours available  The flavours I tried were London Fog  Earl Grey   hazelnut  MUD  espresso  almonds and fudge   peanut butter and jelly  espresso   I was  starting to get a bit of a sugar rush and my stomach was turning with all the different flavours  plus I m lactose intolerant and forgot my Lactaid   but heck people wait in line for over an hour  so this place must be good and worth it    I would have tried more flavours  but out of nowhere a group of people started to form a line behind me   I guess good things do come to an end eventually  but lucky for my stomach I didn t have to feed it with more dairy and sugary goodness   Everything in moderation is okay  right   Bang Bang definitely didn t disappoint as all the flavours I tried were creamy and rich  plus full of tasty goodness that tasted like the flavours indicated  Samples were generous offerings on metal spoons  They definitely didn t skimp on the cream and flavourful ingredients   I ended up getting half an ice cream sandwich  espresso with an everything cookie  since I just finished lunch and the fact I tried so many flavours  I wouldn t have been able to stomach a full size ice cream sandwich    I m not a coffee drinker  but I do love coffee flavoured ice cream   The espresso ice cream definitely hit the spot  plus the cookie was soft and chewy  It was absolutely delish that I thought perhaps I should have had the full ice cream sandwich because if something was that good  I somehow can always make room for it   Would I ever wait in line for Bang Bang  Absolutely not   Definitely a place for good ice cream or if I want to splurge       for half an ice cream cookie sandwich  but I probably could do without the ice cream and my stomach will probably thank me too ,5,2015-07-12
I went on a humid Wednesday night in September around      jus before closing the wait was about      min  I really wanted to try their waffle but it was a    min wait and I was impatient    I ordered a half Sammie and one fully Sammie  Sammies are icecream cookie sandwiches  The cookies were fresh and soft and the ice cream was rich and creamy  I jus wish it wasn t so humid outside my ice was melting to quickly ,5,2016-09-09
Cookie ice cream sandwiches with burnt toffee and milk n cream ice creams   Waaaay tastier than the only instagram worthy Sweet Jesus  but not line up worthy  No more delicious than the ice cream sandwiches from PC in supermarkets    Repeat  unlikely,3,2017-09-03
Gluten free sammie with nutella was delicious  Seating would have been nice  They let you taste flavors  but only one per person ,4,2018-08-30
Amazing and worth the wait  I got the half sandwich with peanut butter cup on the everything cookie,5,2018-04-01
I visited this location during October and unfortunately the macaron was sold out for the day  I ended up ordering the London Fog Ice Cream Puff Sandwich instead    The London Fog Ice Cream was really good  with the flavor really apparent  the puff pastry was too dry for me  A small complaint about the ice cream though  I ate this on a chilly day  in October   yet the ice cream melted really fast  I end up having to scoop the soupy ice cream to eat with the pastry as it was dry so you can t eat it by itself either ,4,2015-02-15
It was BUSY  But we got our order pretty quick  Waffle was nice and crispy  I would come back again ,4,2018-08-02
This is worth the trek to Ossington  The ice cream tasted fresh and not artificial  There are a ton of different ice cream and cookie flavours so no matter who you are with  they are bound to find something they will like  I had the vegan ice cream and gluten free cookie option which was SO TASTY  Those are two things that are hard to find but Bang Bang did it and did it well  The line was crazy long but I can see why ,4,2017-06-26
I tried many gourmet ice cream shops in Vancouver and in the States and Bang Bang is definitely up there in my books  Like similar places  you can spot it from two blocks away due to the lineup  They have an interesting array of flavours  The best thing about it is that they have non cone options to hold and exalt the ice cream  cream puffs  cookies for ice cream sandwiches and HK bubble waffle    Wait was a bit crazy cus it was two people manning the whole place  They only allow one tasting per person  and tasting overall seems discouraged  The guy with the arm sleeve helping us out at one point rolled his eyes at us when we were deciding flavours    We ordered half an ice cream sandwich  everything cookie   ginger milk ice cream         and it was huge  The cookie is every cookie monster s dream and the ginger milk had a nice spicy  but not overwhelming  kick to it  We also had a waffle with taro and coconut mango cream pudding      for the ultimate HK flavour combo  Waffles are made to order so expect to wait a bit  AND IT WAS SO WORTH IT  The batter for the bubble waffle is pretty spot on  The taro was as usual  abnormally purple  but had great flavour and not overly sweetened  Mango was a hit with us as well  We will be returning for sure    There are two bar stools and a tucked away bench in the store  so plan to take your treat outside ,5,2015-11-13
The BEST ice cream in Toronto hands down  They re known for the ice cream sandwiches but I think the ice cream in itself is well worth the trip and the sometimes very long line  Rocky Roadkill is exceptional and has swirls if roasted marshmallows that taste like they re straight from the campfire   Peanut butter cup and Miso Mon Cheri are also high on the list ,5,2019-07-08
Best ice cream in Toronto  It s so smooth and so soft yet so creamy and light at the same time   It s amazing  My top   in no particular order are  London Fog  Lychee Rosewater  and Good Humor Me  or something along the line  Can t remember the exact name but the description said it s made with Ontario strawberry  it s seasonal item   I really like the Good Humor Me  it sort of taste like strawberry cheesecake but lighter  It s amazing   One thing that kinda threw me off when I first visited was that you are only allowed to try one flavour of ice cream as sample  But maybe that s needed considering the line up that s always there    Strictly speaking on the ice cream texture and taste though  definitely   out of   ,5,2018-10-12
Sometimes there s things that  no matter what you do  can t really be made much better  To me  ice cream is one of them  Now don t get me wrong  I think there s a big difference between no name ice cream and Ben and Jerry s  but to me  there is no such thing as bad ice cream  Ice cream is always good  This makes it easy to be happy with what I have  but also puts a ceiling on how good something can get  This to me  is also the dilemma of Bang Bang  Great ice cream  but regardless of how much thought and quality ingredients went into the ice cream  it still tastes much like a lot of other quality ice cream I ve had   Now let me make this abundantly clear  It s good freaking ice cream  It s some high quality ice flavor going on here  The cookies are also very good  The quality is beyond most standards  It s good    The staff is fairly friendly  I ve been there a few times and most of the time they re really slammed  but once they weren t and the service was meh  But they re not rude  and I d say to be fair that they re fairly typical of what the service industry in Toronto provides   It s pretty expensive  A full ice cream sandwich is about     For ice cream it s on par with Sweet Jesus and other designer ice cream stops  but    for two cookies and ice cream is a bit steep   Still worth it to go  Nothing crazy  but then again when it comes to ice cream  it appears I ll settle for just about anything,4,2016-05-26
Oh my god this place is amazing  They have several options of ice cream   in a cup  in a cone  in a cookie sandwich  or in a Hong Kong egg waffle cone  Their ice cream flavours are also super unique and not flavours I d imagine go together  but actually tastes so good   The owner was super friendly  and let us sample a bunch of flavours since we couldn t make up our minds haha  The lychee with raspberry  ginger milk  and banana pudding were all super good  I finally opted for the totaro  purple yam   coconut  and oolong  which were amazing  The totaro was very creamy and tasty  and the oolong was more subtle but also super delicious  My friends also tried the burnt toffee and matcha flavours  which they enjoyed very much   When we asked the owner her favourite flavor  she said it was beer brown bread  which are   ingredients that I definitely don t imagine together  Even though the option wasn t on the menu today  she gave us a sample from the freezer  It was a more subtle and unique taste which was very good as well    On the weekends  they also have more sweets options  such as cinnamon buns and pies   Overall  super satisfying and delicious and wonderful service  Will definitely be back ,5,2016-03-02
They gave me cinnamon ice cream by accident  It was the most delicious mistake ever  I really also like the Sam James espresso   And every flavour I ve had so far  The line gets a bit long but they are such a tiny place  If it s busy  don t order the waffle  unless you really don t mind waiting  it will be delicious and fresh ,4,2015-04-23
Had the dark chocolate cookie with espresso ice cream  Considering all the hype line ups I was quite underwhelmed the ice cream was full of ice crystals and the flavour wasn t very strong    They should re spin the ice cream to avoid the ice crystals    Disappointed but perhaps I ll try it again  ,3,2014-07-12
After a nice warm noodle soup from Pho Tien Thanh down the street  we walked in to check this place out  We came on a rainy Sunday afternoon having no idea what this place was called because they don t have a sign and there was no line up so why not    The dude behind the counter introduced us to the plethora of flavours and options  lol    Totaro    We decided to get a puff  thinking it was just a cream puff  then finding out they add ice cream inside  He recommended london fog ice cream  which we got a sample of  which btw are HUGE sample sizes   We went with it   As we were paying I realized that this place was called Bang Bang and a good number of my friends had posted photos of this place on Instagram  Then I realized that we didn t even have to line up to eat here  So that was cool   The ice cream puff was REALLY good  the London Fog flavour is perfect with it  They cut it in half for us and we ate it like ice cream sandwiches  Shared between   people  it s a reasonably priced dessert  There are some seats on the side that we ate at since there was only   other group there at the time    We probably would have gotten the hong kong waffles  but their machine was broken that day  I would love to come back again to try that  but I m afraid of the lineups other Yelpers speak of  haha ,5,2015-06-16
I m very impressed  This ice cream tastes amazing  Does not taste generic whatsoever like I was expecting  The ice cream sandwiches are fairly large also  highly recommend this shop ,5,2016-06-19
My favourite place for ice cream in Toronto  You can just get a scoop of ice cream but they also make ice cream sandwiches out of waffle or cookie  Their cookies are all made in store and I would recommend the Everything cookie    They also have unique ice cream flavours so try everything ,5,2018-04-12
Bang bang is such a great ice cream spot  I love the unique offerings  Mudd especially  The downside is that you should expect to wait ,3,2017-08-16
I usually get the     ice cream sandwich cookie which I find to be the perfect portion size  I actually like their cookies more than their ice cream selection  They have a variety of rotating ice cream flavours like the popular Totaro but I usually go for the London Fog with the oatmeal cookie  I have tried others but the flavours were not quite intense enough  They also have a warm chocolate chip cookie that goes really well with most of their flavours like burnt toffee and soybean walnut  They also have an HK egg waffle and ice cream combo which I have never tried and feel is way overpriced  and I think I prefer egg waffles on their own   Expect average wait time of       mins depending on time of day and whether it is a hot day or not    I find its sister shop Bakerbots a nicer location although they have a smaller selection ,4,2017-08-04
First off  I m not the biggest fan of ice cream but when a craving hits for an ice cream sandwich  it s gotta be satisfied  Figured I d try bang bang and see what the fuss was about    Got the everything cookie with peanut butter and jelly ice cream  I have to say the cookie was amazing  Soft and big enough to make a cookie sandwich  They don t skimp on the ice cream too  Unfortunately after hearing rave reviews about the pb j I was expecting to be mind blown  Didn t really taste the jelly  mostly pb  However a half sandwich costs around     so a cheaper alternative than getting dessert at a restaurant  I also got an oatmeal raisin cookie which was just as soft and delicious  I d go back just for the cookies    There also isn t much room to sit    small benches outside so youre left either taking it on the go or standing up trying to eat it    Which can get messy  So get a lot of napkins   Apparently line ups are ridiculous during the summer  so don t go during the late evenings if you want to skip the rush  During the day its slower so satisfy your craving on a random time if you don t want to wait over    minutes ,3,2015-01-11
Line up is long but worth it  The flavours are unique and yum ,5,2017-11-30
The wait is about       mins when they re busy but damn  is it worth it  It takes about    minutes longer to get the Chinese waffle when they re busy  so expect to wait  but again  it s worth it  Favourite Flavours  Banana Pudding   Cinnamon Toast ,5,2017-09-16
I m in love with their unique and delicious ice cream flavours and their display  Variety of ways to eat them as well  can t go wrong with any ,4,2016-02-07
I  LOVE  BANG  BANG    Stay Classy Burnt Toffee is my go to  You won t be disappointed ,5,2019-07-09
Came here on a Friday night around     pm  waited in line for about       minutes  I decided to be adventurous and tried the fruit loops flavour ice cream in a hk waffle  Flavours are rich and there was real fruit loop bits in it which was great ,4,2015-07-01
Great ice cream   It s all about the ice cream sandwiches here  Freshly baked cookies and great flavours ,5,2014-09-15
My favourite ice cream spot in the city     times out of     the flavours are delicious and surprising   Once in a while you ll try a flavour that doesn t work as well  at least for my palette      but that s something to expect when they try new and fun combinations     Beware  there usually is a line up  however they have gotten much more tolerable   And it s definitely worth it   Prices are fair ,4,2017-09-17
I got the To taro and matcha ice cream to go along with the waffle cone  It was nice to know that the ice creams were home made and wait time wasn t too bad  perhaps I came on a not so busy day   I would love to come back here again to try the other unique flavors that were offered  I highly recommend this place for those of you in Toronto seeking a place to fulfill your sweet tooth needs ,5,2017-05-19
The line up out the door looks intimidating but it moves fairly quick  The line ended at the store next door but it was only a    minute wait  And boy was it it worth it   I had a cookie dough ice cream puff  To be honest I wasn t too impressed when I had a bit of the ice cream by itself  But that quickly changed as I took a bite with the puff  As a sandwich the entire thing was so delicious  It made me quite sad when I finished it    Would definitely come back  Looking forward to trying the HK waffle with ice cream  Actually had a dream about it ,5,2014-08-03
London Fog Ice cream in a Nutella Cream puff  I have no words   just WOW  Expect to wait in line    Waited about    mins but well worth it   ,5,2015-08-24
OMG    This place is amazing  All the other ice cream sandwich places honestly pale in comparison  We have driven past here many  many times  and there has always been such a huge lineup that we ve never bothered to try this place out  I m happy to say that I totally get the hype    They have so many unique flavours here  I had a hard time deciding what to get    We ordered the Nutella puff with the Nocciola ice cream  as well as the Fig  Honey  and Chevre  they re not messing around  they use Grey Owl Chevre here   and Matcha ice creams with the egg waffle cone  They were both beyond amazing  I ve never had the egg waffle type before and it was a really nice change from just the usual cookie offerings for ice cream sandwiches  Having said that  their cookies did look really good  I just didn t get a chance to try them this time around because they had too many other unique things to choose from  I can t wait to go back to try more flavours ,5,2016-12-29
As others have stated the ice cream was worth the long wait in line  They had a great selection of flavours and great accompaniments like cookies and waffle cones  I had the Hong Kong cone with cinnamon toast and vegan vanilla bean  and my boyfriend had the Hong Kong done with mud and cinnamon toast  which tastes exactly like cinnamon toast crunch     Would definitely return ,4,2015-08-16
Absolute all time favourite dessert spot  I always recommend this place to everyone I can  and never heard a complaint about bang bang  apart from the forever long lines    I have tried practically everything here  but my favourite has to be the peanut butter chocolate ice cream in a Hong Kong waffle  Secondary favourites include the Nutella puff pastry  and earl grey ice cream   The great thing about this place is that they also serve vegan ice cream  may not be tons of choices but there are a few good ones here  including the cookies ,5,2016-06-08
A couple of Toronto friends brought my friend and I here last Thursday night  Homemade ice cream  Wait on line is typically    minutes here  Once you actually get to the front  it goes pretty quickly   You can choose to order either a half    cookie cut in two  or a full ice cream sandwich    cookies   Lots of different combinations you can come up with since there s so many ice cream flavors and   cookie options  There are vegan and gluten free options  You can also opt to not get any cookies  They offer cup  cone  puff cinniebun and big bang waffle  The egg waffle option seems popular as well  though it has a longer wait time   The lychee  w raspberry curd  rosewater flavored ice cream here was really good   I d recommend  I ordered a half on an everything cookie  My friend had the Totaro flavor  I ve had better taro flavored ice cream  try Soft Swerve if you re ever in NYC   Cookies can be on the sweet side   Place is small  You order  pick up and pay  and then eat outside  They accept credit card  important since I didn t have any Canadian money on me   I d come back again if I was in the area ,4,2017-08-05
This is a small dessert shop with no seating  Line was fairly short on a Saturday afternoon and line moves very quickly    I got   cookie w   scoops of ice cream  Note that the ice cream flavors are not out for display  I got burnt toffee and matcha tiramisu        The burnt toffee tasted like a sugary vanilla  The matcha tiramisu was VERY disappointing  especially since it cost extra  The ice cream itself had the freezer taste and the flavor combo did not work well imo   The chocolate cookie was also not as soft as I had hoped    This review is based on the flavors I got  I tried my friends  choices and they seemed pretty good  milk tea  jasmine   matcha  London fog ,3,2019-04-30
Had the London Fog and Hazelnut ice cream waffle  Sorry  took a few bites already  Waffle is perfectly crispy  London Fog is delish  not too sweet with the tasteful aroma of earl grey tea  The hazelnut is too sweet for the London Fog combination  but nonetheless a great dessert ,4,2019-05-15
I always used to pass by this place on Ossington and would not bother going in because of the line  But let me tell you  I ve been missing out  The line isn t so bad and tends to move quickly  I had half an ice cream sandwich which I thought was a great portion size and you get to try two flavours  I got the lychee rose raspberry which was a great combo of flavours along with the hazelnut chocolate  I didn t care for the cookie so much but the icecream was fantastic  Highly recommend and I know I ll be back ,4,2019-09-02
The ice cream is good  but how in the world do they offer HK waffles at this price  Not only is it out datedly high priced  but they only have two machines  one of which seems to always be broken  The staff seems to be incredibly inefficient  given that there is no reason that it should take over    minutes from the moment the order is given  not including the time in the line  here  to actually provide it  Overall disappointing   ,2,2016-11-15
Bang Bang has been on my list for years  long before I ever considered myself a foodie or heard about most other places  So glad I finally got to check it off  It s one of those places that are hyped up AND actually amazing  and has remained that way for years  it seems  Got the half ice cream sammie  with Totaro and matcha jasmine   soba buckwheat splitz  The Totaro was taro   coconut bits and just sweet enough for me and the matcha taste is almost Tsujiri strong  So good  You can also get your ice cream in a puff  HK egg waffle cone  or just in a cup if you want to save a few calories   Mind you that this was the fourth stop of our crawl and before leaving the third spot  Carmen   we all said we were stuffed and were gonna skip ice cream   but decided to walk there and check it out anyway  Oh how swiftly our minds changed after taking in the smell  It smells just like a bakery inside  because they have cookies and cake slices too   Will definitely be back soon  So many more flavours to try ,5,2018-11-26
This place is good  Stopped by here on a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon and there was a lineup out the door  Don t let that stop you though  it moved fast and we got to order in about    minutes  Be aware that at this time  they don t accept debit  only credit and cash    I went with the ginger cookie    cookie split in half  and captain crunch ice cream  My oh my was it delicious  The cookie was soft  yet crunchy around the outside  and also chewy  while having that ginger bite  The ice cream was so creamy and spot on  I consider the price of       to be extremely reasonable as there was a lot of ice cream   My boyfriend chose the double and got   peanut butter cookies with banana pudding ice cream and it was equally good  Cost for the double        Prices are great  product is great  go check it out ,5,2014-06-08
I don t care much for the ice cream  What I value more than anything is the soul Bang Bang brings  not only to Ossington  but to Toronto as a whole  There really is  no place like it in the city  Go  wait in line  get the ridicilous ice cream and be happy that you re a part of genuine  culture  brewing up ,5,2017-06-13
THE HYPE IS SO REAL  AND SO WORTH IT   Bang bang has a few things going for it          scoop that s a good size  huge unique flavour selections  and several baked goods options on how to sandwich your ice cream  Their cashiers are also great about giving you samples to try     THE ICE CREAM   I ve tried several flavours and these stood out to me   Rosewater Lyc e        Totaro  Avocado  Punkin  Pie   Coconut Mango Puddin        tasted more like creamy mango lassi  Right amount of sweetness  loved the sticky rice chunks  but I couldn t taste the coconut though   A Bad Dad Joke         the butterscotch flavour was soooo authentic and VERY sweet  The small chunks of pecans were nice but I couldn t taste the miso in them   The flavours are so authentic   true  I particularly liked sandwiching the ice cream with the cream puff as it s soft and was easy to eat ,5,2017-10-21
Bang bang ice cream is awesome  The lines for it are not  There s little you can do about it if you want ice cream after dinner during the summer    They offer over a dozen flavours  including some vegan varieties  Ice cream can be on a cone  cookie  cinnamon bun  or dish     Their unique flavours and beautiful presentation keep the lines large  If you ve never been  it s worth the wait ,4,2018-09-03
I m just going to put this out there   I m lactose intolerant  It s not pretty and I m sorry I have to tell you this  but my willingness to sacrifice well being and bowel function is a testament to how great Bang Bang is  Every time I m in Toronto  every other month or more   I will in addition to above noted sacrifice  wait in line for up to an hour for this deliciously excruciating experience  Why is it so good you ask  Well  for starters they have   CHINESE EGG WAFFLE  WAFFLE CONES   OMG OMG OMG  Fresh baked cookies for ice cream sandwiches Fresh cream puffs for cream puff sandwiches Fresh macarons for macaron ice cream sandwiches  If you re a weirdo or on some stupid carb free diet and the above pastry component doesn t entice you  then have the ice cream  Although I have yet to try all of them since they have a rotation of new ones every season  I can attest that all I ve tried is fantastic  Orange cardamom  my all time favourite and the flavour that turned me onto anything cardamom is the best cardamom infused Ice cream I ve had to date  With just enough hints of zesty orange and cardamom spice to make you want more after each bite  only to realize in desperation that you should have gotten three scoops   Bang Bang hit it dead on with this flavour  London fog is also a great on as is the lychee with rosewater essence  If you re around this season though  make sure you try out the mango puddin  with warm coconut sticky rice  It s like they somehow took a juicy ripe mango  turned it into an even creamier and more delicious version of itself and threw it on top of legit thai sticky rice with coconut cream  Who even thinks of that  They did clearly and it s so delicious    Hands down my favourite ice cream place out of any ice cream place I ve tried in Canada  For uniqueness of flavours alone  they should get five points but they ve managed to score full points in every level for flavour  creativity and just damn good ice cream  I know where I m going in two weeks ,5,2016-08-03
Bang Bang is Ah Mazing  There were   of us in all  everyone ordered something different and everything  I m not kidding  was absolutely delicious  Out of the    flavors we got  the Lychee Rosewater was my favorite  If you like lychee  get it  You won t be disappointed  Well  truthfully  get anything and you won t be disappointed  Ah Mazing  The place is small and there is very limited seating  meaning one bench   so be prepared ,5,2018-04-10
Be prepared for a line up  We only visit when we drive or walk by with a line up that doesn t go out the door  Luckily  this visit was such the case    The line up on a nice day is definitely well worth it if you re in line with the right person to have your time go by with a happy gastronomic ending ,4,2017-05-06
Very good ice cream  I had the miso cherry and the chocolate hazelnut  The Hong Kong waffle cone was unique and tasty but since they make them to order the line was extremely long and I waited    minutes after ordering before my cone was ready  Unfortunately the cone was so hot that the bottom scoop of ice cream totally melted so I barely got to taste it ,4,2015-06-07
This is my second time here and every time was very pleasant  I ve only tried their ice cream with egg puffs which is the best thing ever  This time when I came back I thought I will give avocado a try since I had green tea  last time  Oops  no more avocado  but there s oolong tea  I asked for a taste of oolong tea and it was amazing  It was the right amount of sweet with a strong taste of oolong tea  The wait for the egg puffs was        minutes which was not too unreasonable  The shop is small and it was packed on my day there so please remember to tell them your name and wait for them to call you when you wait outside  Once you get your ice cream the wait was well worth it  Enjoy ,5,2016-06-29
Their London fog ice cream    holy grailll   I also find their totaro one cool just cause it s totoro haha  I always get their Hong Kong egg waffle with   scoops of ice cream  it is delicious each time  Love how pho tien thanh is next door cause I get it after I have some pho  The line for this place during summer though    expect to wait ,5,2017-03-13
Homemade cookies and ice cream  The line ups aren t as bad as Sweet Jesus  Ihalo  and other trendy places  Very  very delicious,4,2017-06-25
SO  WORTH  IT   We were in the area for the Pug Grumble  aside  one of the best events of Toronto  pugs are great  and we were looking for a nice refreshing treat  We stumbled upon Bang Bang and were a little worried by the line up  It wasn t even that sunny  but there was a decent amount of people    Do not let the line discourage you     Bang Bang ice cream is one of the few desert places that I would gladly line up for  The ice cream is good AND the presentation is to die for  It s rare to find ice cream places that will kill it on both flavour and looks    Anyway I got the london fog ice cream in oatmeal cookies  And my boyfriend got the totaro and green tea ice cream in the waffle cones  Oh myyyyyy gooooshhhh  It was ice cream heaven   If you re in the area  you should definitely drop by Bang Bang Ice Cream and get banged with some quality ice cream ,5,2017-05-25
Every time I go by Bang Bang  there is a huge line up   The only time there isn t a line up is when it s closed   When I walked by today  there was no line up and it was open so I HAD to stop in   I got a double scoop of Fresh Mint  which had chunks and slivers of chocolate  in a cup   It was creamy and yummy   When I walked in  the first thing that hit me was the smell of cinnamon   Yum   When I asked  I was told it was their Cinnibuns   Needless to say  two came home with me for Gord and I   Usually they slice them in half and put ice cream in the middle   They were delicious   The icing was nice and sweet and it was a soft cinnamon bun  rather than traditionally dense    I ll be back ,4,2017-07-07
Pick your own cookies to make a custom ice cream sandwich   so worth the calories  though getting your first choice ice cream flavor is hit or miss depending on the size of the usually long line ,4,2014-10-08
In the   days I had in Toronto  I dreamed about this place all   days and ate here twice  My good friends and I were on vacation for about a week in Toronto  and this was the first ice cream place we stopped at  We came on a Friday night around      PM  and there was a line down the block  We waited for    minutes to get to the front of the line and order and then another    minutes to get our Hong Kong style waffle cones    The waffle wasn t the best I ve ever had  but it s still delicious  They only have   machines  and since they make it to order  prepare to wait even longer if you get one when there is a long line  They have the COOLEST ice cream flavors  I ve tried the  Thank You Very Matcha   Cinnamon Toast  and Totaro  The matcha was def  my favorite  it s has a great matcha flavor  The Totaro and the cinnamon toast were excellent as well  The totaro s flavor was a little bit weaker than I would have liked  Still  it s some of the best ice cream I ve ever had  The moment my friends and I took a bite  we knew that hour wait and complaining was WELL worth it  I would do it all over again if I had to  The service is good too  They re efficient and actually pretty friendly despite the long lines and amount of stress I m sure they re going through   We came our last day as well  That s how good it was  we couldn t stop talking about it and had to make another trip  It was a Wednesday at      PM and there wasn t too much of a line  I would suggest getting here early or be prepared to wait for a while  But trust me  you ll want to wait for it  It is worth even an hour long wait  It is way better then Red Bench or other ice cream spots  This is the one ice cream place you need to check out  They are closed on Monday s  and only take credit cash  no debit ,5,2015-08-16
Bang Bang s ice cream sandwiches are intense  I am an ice cream lover and this is probably the one time that I was not able to finish an ice cream sandwich by myself because they fill it up with so much  Muddled between two pieces of amazing cookies  this is definitely one of my favorite ice cream sandwiches of all time    I love all of the wild flavors that they come up with  If you re looking for the egg waffle paired with ice cream  there will be a longer wait since they need to cook it up and wait for it to cool before throwing the ice cream on since it could melt  It wasn t my favorite item here  but the ice cream flavors did make up for it    We had quite a wait  but I feel like that it was worth it  Because of the popularity here  it definitely limits the tasting menu which is a relief for everyone else who is waiting ,4,2018-06-06
I don t queue   it s my right as a New Yorker to glare angrily at queuing people  and march huffily away when a line forms to anything  My Canadian friend who also apparently doesn t queue for anything told me it was worth waiting on line like an idiot for ice cream from this place   So I waited  And the line moved surprisingly fast  so I only felt like a lame o for a little while  And then came the ice cream selections  Holy mother of dairy   the flavor combinations were cool and tasty  Flavors like London Fog  earl grey and then some  or Totaro  taro flavored pun on a Mizayaki classic   The first time I went  I had the key lime pie ice cream  It was like eating a frozen key lime pie in the form of creamy goodness  The second time  yes  I had to go back    I had this lovely orange ice cream that was no creamsicle  Have it in sandwich form with their dark chocolate cookies   you will not be disappointed    Can t wait to visit TDot or  the    again so I can come here ,5,2017-11-16
Got there around     pm on a Thursday  and waited for more than   hr   half an hr for placing an order  about another hr to get the ice cream   Cuz they only have   waffle makers  and one person operating  it literally takes FOREVER  But the ice cream is awesome  and the guys there are just so awesome  especially the guy who makes the waffle  While busy making waffle  he somehow managed to notice that I needed a spoon  and passed one to me  Not sure if the ice cream is that good for    mins  wait  but it s truly a cute place ,4,2015-08-02
Wow  this place blew all expectations what an ice cream shop is  First of all  this place is filled with fresh baked goods  I love their fresh cookies with delectable ice cream flavours  I would definitely recommend totaro and genmaicha    For this trip  I opted for something for caffeine infused like   mud  which was coffee ice cream with chocolate almonds  They are definitely the same bake shop as baker bots but with more flavours and their cookies are covered in a glass case  They are    cents more expensive  Either way  it was delicious  there is a line and money well spent ,5,2016-09-17
Hate the lines but damn this place is good  I m picky about ice cream and this stuff is awesome  Love the Tataro  It s rich so sharing is tempting but then again why would you share such deliciousness  Love that they have unique flavours you can t get anywhere else ,5,2018-10-16
This small ice cream nook is such a gem  Went on a rainy day  but the line was still fairly long  the staff were extremely busy They had beautiful flavours  nothing short of creativity  I got the London Fog with puff pastry  it s probably one of the best ice cream flavour tried ever in my life   One star taken off due to the extreme busy environment  everything was rushed  Most of them couldn t bother explaining a thing or two  The cashier that day was extra impatient with any holdups during the transaction  But understandable   the small space was so crowded with people  there was barely any elbow room   But the mystery is the shop sign  In this whole experience I found nothing that read bang bang hmmmm,4,2019-06-22
Dropped by on recommendation from a friend  The lineup    It was HUGE  My first thought was how could an ice cream sandwich be worth such a wait  But worth it  it was   The cookies are so chewy and delicious   and the ice cream is right up there with the best I ve ever had  You ll be lucky to stop by without having to wait  but regardless  you ll be happy you did ,5,2015-08-27
Ice cream was amazing  customer service can be improved while waiting    minutes for my waffle they messed up   other orders with putting the wrong once cream on the waffle ,4,2017-08-28
I can t be happier after going to this place and ordering an awesome London Fog ice cream with an everything cookie  I loved it   I arrived at     pm in a very hot Saturday  I was surprised to have just   people in front of me  It was very easy to order  They don t have tables so you have to either eat at the door or you can go to Trinity Bellwood s Park which is what I did   I m glad I ordered a cookie and not a cone  It would ve melted way before I finished it   Definitely going back and trying more flavours   Tip  if you can t find the place  like me  look for the green boards that you can see on my picture   London fog and matcha together is my new favourite combination ,5,2016-05-28
Had the double scoop of taro and key lime pie  The key lime pie was really tangy and actually tasted like real key lime pie  The taro flavour was much more subtle than the key lime pie  and had the authentic taro taste  I was hoping the taro icecream would be more similar to the taro bubble tea flavour but it was still good  Would come back to BangBang but would not have the taro flavour ,5,2016-09-02
I ve been here a few times   it s definitely an amazing place   I just wish the website would update the flavours offered for that day so we know which ones we can get     I absolutely love the rich   rare flavours offered   Yes there s almost always a lineup but if you plan your day properly you won t be waiting long ,5,2017-08-15
Being in Toronto for the day  the is a must try  Heard about the long lines so we tried to get here early  Arrived at around   and there was a small line in front with about a ten minute wait for the bubble waffle cones    I got the bubble style waffle cone with a scoop of the lychee rosewater with raspberry curd and a scoop of the totaro  The lychee was very lovely and subtle with the raspberry curd around it adding to the sweetness  The totaro with is purple yam and coconut was also very good  for fans of taro and the like    Overall I m glad I got a chance to come even if I had to walk a lot to get here ,5,2018-07-25
I   I would move to Canada for this     Holy  Ice Cream  Sandwiches    I can t even right now  the memory is overwhelming me  So delicious and perfect    I would even eat their ice cream in Antarctica  on the coldest day  Penguins would gaze at me with jealousy   My only regret is that the Hong Kong Waffle machine was out of order   We heard that the line is usually out the door  but we lucked out and came when there were only three other customers ahead of us  SO MANY FLAVORS  It was really hard to make a decision since they had so many different kinds of ice creams and combinations  They have cookies and ice cream for those of you with dietary restrictions too  like Vegan Avocado and the Vegan Almost Everything cookie   If the line isn t too long  you can sample to heart s content  But here s how we do      Be awestruck at the sheer amount of ice cream flavors they have     Feel heart broken that you can t possibly try them all without getting murdered by the people behind you     SAMPLES     Pick a flavor or four    we don t judge     Pick a cookie  puff  or HK waffle  you can also do a full ice cream sandwich or a half ice cream sandwich      Pay  They re worth the price     ATTAIN ICE CREAM NIRVANA   In all seriousness  though  it was absolutely delicious  They make all the ice cream flavors in house and they actually bake all the cookies too  They used to order them from the place next door  but eventually began doing their own thing    I ended up getting the Plain Puff w  London Fog  Earl Grey  Ice Cream and my cousin got the Everything Cookie w  Burnt Toffee    both were delicious  I had also sampled their Vegan Avocado and it was also amazing  somehow  they still managed to make it creamy  Service was also really friendly  I d definitely wait an hour in line for these goodies ,5,2015-07-15
What a cool fun place to grab ice cream  even though there was a line they have unique flavours  that may run out so beware  and cool cookies  I got an everything cookie with london fog ice cream and it was amazing  It s really nice that they make everything in house and that s exactly why people keeping coming back to this little spot ,4,2016-09-26
It was a really sunny and hot day so we decided to get some ice cream  We heard about the hype here and my friend told me there is always a line up  The line moved by pretty fast but there were no tables at all inside  more like a booth  and two benches outside    I was dissapointed to learn that the waffles would be an extra    minutes wait  plus we weren t super hungry and we always had this waffle at Tung Tung in PMall anyways  so we didn t get it  It would ve been such an IG worthy photo tho  I tried the earl grey scoop and my friend chose oolong flavour on simple cones  They both tasted very much like their respective teas  The texture was very smooth and creamy  unlike the icy ones served at AYCE or grocery store ones  They also gave generous portions    I would definitely return to try out all their other flavours   maybe finally on a waffle for that photo too ,4,2016-06-21
From out of town  ubered to Bang Bang at  pm and they were closed despite calling and confirming that they closed at   pm  Sad  ,1,2018-01-18
What s another   star review  Bang Bang is my go to for ice cream in Toronto  I ve tried the fresh mint  birthday cookie dough and hazelnut ice creams   all of which are fantastic  by the way  I ve had the rococoa and chocolate chip cookies   once more  both are great  I highly recommend Bang Bang  I wish the service were more efficient so that the line went faster ,5,2018-08-11
I was really excited to try Bang Bang because I am an ice cream fiend and their menu looked really interesting  I found it to be good  but nothing that blew my mind  I compared it in my mind to an artisan ice cream shop back home in Rochester  and it actually did not measure up   First off  this place is small and likely gets very busy  When I went on a Sunday afternoon the line wasn t too bad and we only had to wait about five minutes to order  They have a ton of flavors to choose from and I got the Dulce de Leche and my brother got the Totaro  Both were delicious  but I have to say it wasn t as amazing as I expected it to be based on the other five star reviews  Maybe it was because we just got ours in a dish instead of with cookies or other baked goods because we were walking around and didn t want a melty mess on our hands   That being said  the staff was efficient and friendly and they had a lot of other flavors to choose from and I would definitely return to try more ,3,2019-08-19
Selling both ice cream and baked goods  Bang Bang has something for everyone  With     flavours to choose from  some old school  e g  Chocolate Squared   some not so much  e g  Avocado   if someone doesn t like the creamy and quality ice cream scoops here  the reasoning probably has more to do with that person s personal flavour preferences  I d urge them to try another flavour  taste test first    Pricing goes between              depending on what heavenly baked good you pair your ice cream with  From Nutella Pastry Puffs  Cinnibuns  and a variety of cookies  the choices are endless  Ice cream Sammies and the Hong Kong Waffle are the most popular choices  but one issue I have with the waffle cone is the inconsistency  where at times it s a little too crispy and other times the fluffiness and balanced sweetness makes you want to buy another one to eat on its own  keep in mind that the wait is also longer for waffles   There s almost always a line up here  unless you go right at opening  which I ve done  and while the wait can be tedious with the sweet aroma of freshly baked goods wafting right through the doorway  the line moves fairly quickly  One downside is that there s next to no seating  this is fine in the summer months  as you can walk around outside  but is made more challenging in the winter months  The good news is that they also sell pints  making it easy to satisfy your cravings all year around  And since you ll most likely go back  don t forget to get a loyalty card    Note  They do offer vegan ice cream and cookie options   Favorite flavours  London Fog  Mud  Burnt Toffee  and Lychee Rosewater  paired with either the RoCocoa cookie or a Hong Kong Waffle cone ,4,2018-07-31
Stopped by on a recommendation from a friend  Unfortunately the shop was closed but they saw us looking in and came out with a sample of their new cherry ice cream to try  When we mentioned we were from out of town they popped back in and came out with chocolate and lemon as well  Awesome ice cream  awesome service  Will be back next time we are in the city  Thanks   ,5,2014-08-04
O M G  I dream about this place in my dreams every night and I eagerly await the day that I will be reunite with my half ice cream sammie    Yes the line is long but it moves fast  The ice cream flavours are out of this world and some even come with the opportunity for customization  hellooo mango sticky rice with sticky rice   Cookies are delicious and chewy  I had to hold myself back to not buy a dozen    Highlights of my visit was definitely the lemon hinted birthday cake cookie and the mango sticky rice ice cream ,5,2018-10-16
Yummy and delicious ice cream  Had the  Toroto  purple yam and coconut  ice cream sammie with ginger cookies  I will say though  it s    for a full ice cream sandwich    although filling  I did find it a bit expensive for what it was  so it s not a place that I will come back very often    Is it worth the half hour  minimum  wait  This depends  If you re just looking to get ice cream then no  If you want their ice cream HK egg waffles and or ice cream sammies then yes   Just like everyone said  dress accordingly for the weather and the wait can be super long  there s only two people working in the front   A small bench is also available for seating inside but don t count on getting a spot there ,4,2017-03-12
Oh man  I got banged so hard last night  You know  come to think of it I might have gotten banged    twice  Bang Bang   I got banged once in my mouth and shortly there after I felt the bang enter my stomach  It was      bang a rang    Ok well I could bang this dirty puny drum all day long but let s get down to the dirty details  Everyone knows about Bang Bang Ice cream on Ossington  The first bang has to do with their     flavours of Ice cream and the second bang comes from their freshly baked warm cookies    It s when you put these together that you truly get the full Bang Bang experience  I was looking get double banged last night so I went with a double chocolate chip cookie and paired that with their mint ice cream  prepared sandwich style  Dayummmm   So what does this all mean  No surprise  this place is LIT AF  And when it comes to ice cream sandwiches I m down to get bang banged here anytime    Eatcrest OUT   Ps   others definitely feel the same as I do because there s always a line up of people looking to get banged here    even in the winter ,5,2017-04-05
As handmade ice cream goes  this place isn t all that impressive  There s a nice assortment of flavors and they re all pretty good  but they re not as mind blowingly tasty as a lot of other big city ice cream stores in  say  Chicago or Seattle  I d almost give it an extra star for the novelty of making your own ice cream sandwiches  though  it s a neat idea ,3,2017-10-10
While visiting my brother downtown yesterday I wanted to kill some time  What better way than with ice cream  When we stumbled across this gem it had a line out of the store which usually signals its good  We decided to wait in line which took about maybe ten minutes to get our ice cream  but we were in no rush  All the the ice cream here is homemade with unique flavours available  In addition most customers either get their ice cream in between a cookie  which also come in unique flavours  a bubble waffle cone or on a cream puff    I decided to get a     cookie with two scoops of different ice cream  I chose the everything cookie which was oatmeal with two kids of chocolate  peanut butter and pretzels  The cookie was absolutely delicious it had chunks of chocolate  and big crunchy chunks  Inside I got MUD ice cream which was SJCB mocha with almonds and fudge and a scoop of golden Oreo which was like a vanilla Oreo type ice cream  Now I am not a coffee drinker so I found the mud to be really strong but paired with the Oreo It was perfect  The ice cream was thick and cream and was a fair sized portion  They had tiny spoons for you to eat your ice cream with and they put it in a cute paper container    My only wish is that the cookie was a little softer because when I was trying to break it to eat with my ice cream my spoon was majorly bending but everything was delicious    Definitely a must try      Oh and p s   They sell cookies and ice cream on the side so you could take it home and make your own Sammie s if you d like   ,5,2019-05-19
This place is not overrated  Bang bang  has earned its hype by having a huge selection toon of uniquely flavoured ice creams and delicious treats to go with it  HK waffles  cream puffs  and my favourite   fresh cookies    they re pretty efficient if you end up going with a line so don t be deterred  bang bang is worth the wait   My personal favourite flavours are ginger milk  London fog  and honey chamomile   Lots of flavours to choose from ,5,2017-10-23
The establishment is very small with really no seating so this is a definite take out place  We went across the street to sit on a bench to ear our ice cream  The ice cream was great  It was smooth and creamy  Give them a try and you won t be disappointed  Even though there are lines the service is quick  The staff is very friendly and helpful,4,2019-05-08
I tried their cinnamon toast flavour icecream the other day  It s great  It s not too creamy for me  And the toast taste melt my heart  My friend got the lychee flavour  oh man  That was really good  So fresh and so fruity    Really recommend the lychee flavour  And then I tried ube  which reminded me of my childhodo in Asian  eating ube icecream every day after school    So good   ,5,2016-01-11
Prices are great if you re just getting single or double scoop ice cream without the cookie  I love that they have vegan options  The vegan caramel was okay  but next time I ll stick with vanilla  Don t be intimidated by the line up  it moves pretty fast ,4,2019-10-12
It s okay  not as good as Sweet Jesus  Not worth the hype  they need more flavour in their flavours ,3,2017-11-05
Toronto s answer to Diddy Riese  except that a whole ice cream sandwich at Diddy s is       and half of one at Bang Bang costs         which I suppose is the norm with Toronto s answers to things  Sigh    On the bright side  everything is scrumptious and the ice cream flavours are certainly more exciting than most  I had the London Fog on Everything cookies  which I ll venture to say was a genius pairing of sweet and less sweet  I also tried the Orange Cardamom on birthday sugar cookie  effortlessly encapsulating in dessert form the  je ne sais quoi  m lange of high brow low brow style lauded by fashion magazines around the world  I ALSO returned later the same bloody day and tasted some of my friend s mint ice cream  but we needn t discuss my shame   A full  wich will run you     which ludicrously enough starts to sound like a deal if you re buying two halves for     But even the little ones melt fast  so I ended up glad I went the half route anyway   A small scoop is     but just for kids  Adults pay        I don t know about adult babies  you ll have to ask   The service is so stone cold  I thought I was at Coldstone  Ha   ha   ha  But really  don t expect a smile  Just get your delicious goddamn ice cream and GTFO ,3,2014-07-03
Came here on a super hot Thursday afternoon and there was no line up    until after we lined up haha  I love how creative they are with their ice cream names  I got the Totaro  Taro flavour  sandwiched in the profiterole while my date got half a sammie with orange cardamom ice cream  He regretted not getting the cinnamon flavour  esp since he had been craving cinnamon crunch cereal haha  The next time I visit  I m just gonna go for the cup  because I realize that sandwiches are just too messy for me  It gets everywhere and my fingers get all sticky  They are certainly pretty  and the flavour variety is pretty amazing  but personally  I just want my ice cream to remain semi solid and not melt into a puddle before I can finish it haha  I m not sure I would want to wait in a crazy line  but I think it s great  sans line up   ,4,2015-08-02
If you like ice cream this place is a must try  Same amazing peeps of bakerbots  bloor ossington  fame ,5,2014-06-04
What we ate     RoCocao Cookie Sammie with Campfire marshmallow ice cream    Peanut butter cookie Sammie with burnt toffee ice cream  Ice cream was solid but cookies were even better  Long line on a Tuesday night but it moved quickly  Only downside was that they had run out of several flavours but it was close to closing time  so understandable ,4,2016-06-22
BELIEVE THE HYPE    This place is absolutely amazing  A ton of unique flavours   vegan and non vegan   The line up was massive but it was definitely worth the wait   I got the HK waffles with a scoop of pina colada and totaro and it was absolutely delicious   I ve been to Sweet Jesus before and I m sorry  Bang Bang over Sweet Jesus any day   Can t wait to go back,5,2016-06-07
Arrived at the location only to find out there was a massive line  Possibly the only negative thing about this place  Service was friendly but because they had to freshly make the egg waffles there was a holdup    Ordered the everything cookie sandwich with the chocolate Oreo ice cream  Cookie was chewy and the ice cream was creamy   Figured since I waited about   mins I also made a second order to make the best use of my time here  Ordered the hk waffle with burnt toffee and peanut butter chocolate ice cream  Waffle was on point and so was both of the flavours of ice cream ,5,2014-10-19
Wow  Get the Totaro in a cream puff  Amazing   Constant lineup when it s hot out  all of the bang bang ice cream is made in house  Tons of unique flavors  it s definitely hard to make a decision  They do have a lot of different choices  but with delicious ice cream   fresh baked goods  you can t go wrong ,5,2018-09-10
I ve been going to a lot of new ice cream places lately and I gotta say  Bang Bang is good  Real good  Was it  wait an hour behind four smokers while they blow cancer into my face  good  Well   no  But I wouldn t mind coming again when the wait isn t as crazy    They ve got some pretty interesting options for consuming your ice cream  You can get your ice cream pressed between two cookies  sandwiched in between a pastry  a puff   or rolled up in a HK style egg waffle  Being a square  I decided these were too exciting for me to handle  and opted for two  generous  scoops in a cup    There was still plenty of excitement in the flavours themselves  I m a big fan of having lots of choices  and Bang Bang had a wall full of choices  Ended up with the London Fog  originally wanted Campfire Marshmallow  but they were out  and Burnt Toffee  The London Fog was amazingly flavoured  Tasted exactly like Earl Grey tea  but in ice cream form  The Burnt Toffee was equally amazing  but much sweeter  with actual toffee ribbons and hard bits in the ice cream  I m glad the Burnt Toffee was under the London Fog or it would ve overwhelmed it    Other flavours that I got to try were To taro  love oolong time  banana pudding  mango and sticky rice  yes  actual sticky rice   and vegan vanilla which tastes more like coconut than vanilla  They were all great selections but I actually enjoyed my combination the most  For my lactose intolerant friend  vegan ice cream is always a bonus    I don t think I d ever wait for an hour for ice cream again  even though it was amazing    star worthy ice cream  Knocked off a star for the ridiculous wait and also because the servers don t seem to care that it s a ridiculous wait  While they weren t rude  you d think there might be a bit more of a hustle when the line is stretching down the street  But I guess when you have people willing to wait that long for you  why spend the extra energy                  ,4,2016-05-10
Tasty  but A little over priced compared to other sammie places I ve tried  Wait was long and my server couldn t Crack a smile if she tried ,3,2014-07-12
I feel so conflicted with this review I m about to write  First off  the ice cream flavours were unique    but as a simpleton who enjoys chocolate  the avocado ice cream and Frooty Loops were lost on me    I had a friend in town from Dallas and after an always enjoyable meal at The Good Son  I thought it would be fun to venture over to Bang Bang due to all the hype about this place  I knew about the line based on driving by this place several times and I had also read previous reviews indicating the wait was worth it  Here s where Bang Bang loses me   it was not worth the wait  Chocolate ice cream is chocolate ice cream  The Hong Kong waffle was delish and different however  one gets so excited to order their ice cream you fail to notice just how long it takes to make one of those cones  so you wait  some more  in a tiny little corner with several other patrons waiting for the same thing   Finally  my cone is next   what happens  They call out my ice cream with someone else s name   And freakin   Alice  just takes off with it    Green tea ice cream is NOT chocolate ice cream   So  I wait  again    After an hour and    minutes I finally get my ice cream  I can only imagine working at this place and how unpleasant I d be but these girls are rrrreeeeaaaalllly unpleasant    I wish this was less  rant y  and more of a lovely review however  I was disappointed to say the least    ,2,2015-08-18
I stumbled upon this location while strolling around  I ordered the ice cream sandwich  It was hard to decide on the flavour because everything looked good  Unfortunately I did not know I could try the flavours before ordering  I picked London Fog and Lychee flavour  which were their popular options  They had great flavours  The concept of ice cream sandwich was good  But the sweetness of the cookies overwhelmed the subtle flavours of the ice cream  I would have enjoyed more if I only ate the ice cream  I would give them a second try when I am near the area ,3,2017-11-11
I love baker bots  so was excited to go to bang bang  This   star review is only based on my one experience at bang bang  My rating for baker bots is   stars   I lined up for over an hour at bang bang  all the while mulling over which ice cream flavours to go into my hk egg waffle  and when I finally got to ordering  I was told that one of the waffle machines had broken and it would be another half hour wait if I ordered that  SADNESS    I was so ready to order matcha chestnut and totaro to go in my waffle  asian flavour inspired combo  but then had to change my order and choices on the spot  Would ve been nice if someone had come out to tell everyone in line that one of the machines broke   I had tried the cookie sandwiches at baker bots before so was really hoping to try the hk waffle on this occasion  since that s not an option at baker bots   I ended up ordering a half ice cream sandwich with the everything cookie  and double smoked bacon and cinnamon toast ice cream flavours   My friends liked the bacon flavour  I thought it was pretty good  Kinda reminded me of salted caramel cause of the sweet and salty combination  The cinnamon toast had a good flavour  tasted like cinnamon toast crunch  but the texture was kind of goopy   I don t think I would order those ice cream flavours again  I also tasted the flavours my friends ordered   totaro  black tea  and i think the milk and cookies   The black tea flavour is AMAZING  I had JUST finished ordering and was given my ice cream sandwich  when someone put up the sign for black tea showing that it was now available  Literally right after  I totally would ve gotten that one  cause my friend raved about it when she got it last time  Anyways  she ordered it again  she was in line behind me  and I tasted it  So so so so so good  Totaro was nice and light  Ginger cookie was ok and the cocoa one was too salty for my liking  My fav is still the everything cookie   This place always has a line up in the summer  But I think it s worth the wait for the unique ice cream flavours and delicious cookies ,3,2015-05-30
Be prepared to wait  The line is long all day everyday  It is becoming a landmark in the city if you want icecream  The portions are large  The icecream is good   not exceptional  The burnt toffee and the chocolate flavours are the most delicious and tasty  And the waffle cone is everything ,4,2016-06-08
On our trip to Toronto  I dragged my family here not once  but twice  Really though  they were not complaining  Both days were chilly but that didn t stop the line from forming outside  The venue is small with no seating really  so plan to enjoy this outside or on the go     The waffle cones are made to order but are worth the wait  The warmth of the waffle was a perfect compliment to ice cream  As for flavors  I had to get banana pudding both trips  It was exceptional and tasted just like the real think  Trip one  I paired it with hazelnut and trip two  I chose avocado  The avocado was not overly sweet and I found it went incredibly with banana pudding    I didn t get a cookie sandwich but I helped my brother out with his  They were made quickly and the chocolate cookie was out of this world  We walked here from our Airbnb in Little Portugal and found it easy to find  I hope to go back one day ,5,2018-01-18
So delicious  especially the RoseWater Lychee Waffle   the Salted Honey Flower     But they don t take credit card and the line is so long   ,4,2018-12-18
London fog   Only thing u read about when concerning this place  Tried it and it has a  shampooey  or  soapy  aftertaste that after awhile confuses u because the initial bite tastes amazing    DISCLAIMER  I tried it with the half cookie sandwich so maybe the sweetness of the cookie and the weird taste of the London fog contrasted too much     Also tried the MUD with the HK waffle and the waffle was really good   Crispy outside and soft inside  but the MUD is wayyy too rich in espresso and fudge     In comparison  I m a huuuggeeeee kawartha dairy ice cream man  and their Muskoka mocha is   x better  not an exaggeration     Overall the combination of the lack of parking  NO DEBIT option and extreme line ups on hot days  it s really only deserving of a  star     I did sample the Beer flavour  and that was QUITE good  If I m in the area I would just get that with some  Everything  cookies because those were amazeballs ,3,2015-08-09
Randomly dropped by on a super warm February day for some ice cream and luckily for us  we just beat the afternoon crowd   I was very set on trying the Love Oolong Time in a cookie sandwich but they didn t have that flavour the day we went  I opted for the everything half cookie sandwich with a scoop of London Fog and a scoop of Matcha  It was just the right portions and very fulfilling  The London Fog was super refreshing and I loved the lavender notes in it  The matcha was more tea flavoured than sweet which is what I prefer in my matcha snacks  The cookie was very flavourful but it was more on the crunchy side for my liking   We also tried the egg waffle with a scoop of vanilla bean and matcha  The egg waffle is made fresh so it was nice and fluffy  It complimented the ice cream very well   Can t wait to come again in summer and fingers crossed they ll have the Oolong flavour ,4,2017-02-26
Bang Bang has such good ice cream  Both their cookie sandwich and waffle are good  Its not as convenient as other ice cream places to get to  in my opinion  however its worth the trip ,5,2018-04-12
Please check out Youtube video for prices and choices   https   www youtube com watch v  JLeIAGnpXA There is always line up and it took me    minutes on a Sunday afternoon  But the ice cream and egg waffle really taste good and i love the flavours that they have ,5,2017-02-28
Firstly  it was a challenge to get service  with the line moving slowly along  The food was good  but no more special than a number of dessert places available these days  Service was disappointing however  After waiting for such a long time to get served  the staff seemed fine serving people of out order  despite the substantial lineup  if they pushed themselves ahead  There was no objection from staff at all  So two stars  I ve definitely experienced better ,2,2016-03-15
The ice cream sandwich is cloyingly sweet  I guess I just don t appreciate that much sugar ,3,2017-01-14
I came here last weekend and I m so glad I did  When I heard they had london fog ice cream  I didn t have to think twice  There wasn t much of a line up when I came with my   friends at around  pm on Saturday  maybe about     people in line  Service was very quick and friendly  I came with the intention of getting the Hong Kong waffles but they weren t available  hence the   star rating    Instead I got the london fog ice cream with peanut butter cookie   a strange combination but none of the other cookies really appealed to me  I don t have much of a sweet tooth   The london fog ice cream tasted EXACTLY like a london fog  You can taste the earl grey with the vanilla mixed in with the right amount of sweetness  It was pure heaven  The cookie was delicious with peanut bits and soft enough so that I was able to break the cookie with my spoon but it still held the ice cream well  My one friend got chocolate cookie with sea salt that was also really good  I liked that the sea salt was mixed in with the dough so you get a bit of salt in every bite  She combined hers with vanilla bean ice cream  another taste of heaven  Lastly  my third friend got the birthday cake cookie  too sweet  with the london fog ice cream  yum     I will be back to try the peanut butter and jelly ice cream with the peanut butter cookie  Also love that you can get half sizes  only for the ice cream sandwiches   The half cookie was just the right amount  so I would recommend getting the half size if you re getting it after a meal ,4,2014-09-09
My friends and I went as a treat after a big test  It was the perfect way to top off a hard day  The ice cream flavours are really bold  So be warned  We tried the key lime pie  pink lemonade  London Fog and Thank you very matcha  The London Fog and Matcha were the better flavours  We also tried the Hong Kong waffle  It wasn t made with the same batter as the original Hong Kong snack so it tastes more like a mix between a Belgian waffle and a normal eggy waffle  Overall the ice cream was great but on the pricey side  Would come back as a treat   Note  they do offer half sandwiches which I recommend getting  A full sandwich is ALOT of ice cream and a half perfectly satisfies my sweet tooth ,4,2015-09-22
Gosh darn this place is amazing    Came on a Saturday night around   pm  they line was about    minutes  It was a warm night and everyone in line was friendly so I wasn t bad  Their waffle machine is still broken which was pretty upsetting  Their service was fast  wish they had a little more seating but the space is really small    So I got the cream puff instead with london fog ice cream   it tasted just like the drink and was so creamy and the flavour was strong  The puff had a nice sugar crust on top  I saw some people had a special puff with hazelnuts and chocolate which looked amazing  Also tried their double chocolate with a chocolate cookie   it was really rich and again the ice cream flavour was strong  For both it was       ,5,2015-07-09
A great inexpensive place to satisfy your sweet tooth cravings  be prepared for longer wait times in the summer  The Hong Kong waffles are meh  but the ice cream is another story and prices are competitive   Ice cream lovers need to try this place ,4,2017-12-21
I came here on a Friday night at around   P M  and it was at least a       minute wait    if you love ice cream and all types of desserts then this is the place for you  I got the avocado ice cream and let me tell you  it actually tasted like avocado   They have many unique flavors that you don t want to miss out ,5,2017-08-19
Best ice cream in TO hands down  the rocky road is to die for and the cookie sandwiches are so decadent it will leave you speechless  The line is usually long but it s worth it ,5,2015-08-25
Great spot for a unique flavors in ice cream sandwich in the city  The portions are very good  I had     ice cream sandwich  London fog ice cream and oatmeal cookie  and it was Not too big but not small either  The London fog ice cream flavor was subtle and not too sweet  I loved it      ice cream sandwich       and a full ice cream sandwich     It s worth the price because the ice cream flavors are so different  I really liked my oatmeal cookie  but I think the other ones were just okay and not that unique  everything cookie  la Rocca cookie   Next time I go  which will be soon  I want to try avocado ice cream  The staff also told me that this location is only open in the summer  but they have another store  has a bakery too   streets west of Ossington  just off of Bloor  Go    It s soooo good ,5,2014-08-03
We ordered the     sandwich   ginger cookie with burnt toffee   earl gray and the HK waffle with mint and espresso ice cream  The ice cream was amazing  and just soooooo delicious that I might start drooling from the memory of it  It s hard to pick which ice cream flavour was the best of the four   each was so flavourful that you could tell easily what you were tasting  Bang Bang s ice cream also gets huge points for not being overwhelmingly sweet  I may opt to just get ice cream by itself next time    I found that the ice cream separated from the cookie too easily  perhaps coz it was hot that day  so I was pretty much eating the ice cream and cookie separately anyways  The HK waffle with very good as well   this you probably need two people to share as it is very filling ,5,2015-05-04
I heard about the really long lines for an ice cream sandwich so when I walked by here I was prepared  It might have been the slightly cool wet weather but when I got there at  pm or so on a Sunday  there wasn t a wait  just a few customers before us     I ordered an ice cream sandwich with  WTF  dark chocolate  and dulce de leche  and for the outside cookie  the bday cookie  The ice cream was so rich and delicious  slightly gooey and tasty  The cookie though  could be slightly chewier in my opinion  It was a bit too crisp  Overall  was still yummy ,4,2019-11-04
Can I give them   stars       I had a     ice cream sandwich  went for the avocado ice cream which was deliciously creamy  how creamy    flashback to memories of the best gelato I ever had in Greece years back     that s how creamy   and I had it sandwiched in the oatmeal raisin cookie       The ice cream couldn t have been any better  the cookie was good  but next time I d try a different cookie with it    What I needed was tastes of the cookie just like they had given me tastes of the ice cream    I didn t ask though   maybe they do let you take cookie tastes   Anyway  the sandwich was so damn good  even with the wait in the long line  this place gets   stars ,5,2014-07-26
This place   beautiful foodporn pictures   A couple of friends and I came on a cold day in hopes there would be less of a line up  and we were right  We waited around    minutes to order and receive our ice cream    The ice cream was good   not overly sweet and the flavors were all there  However  the cookies we ordered for the ice cream sandwich were really sweet  and also really chewy to the point where it was almost tough  I know some people might prefer their cookies this way  but I wasn t a huge fan  The HK egg waffle was also soft  and we preferred it to be a little crispy on the outside  Of course  these are all just personal preferences  but I m just letting those who haven t tried it yet know what to expect   I m rating this place     instead of     because it wasn t exceptional   I ve had better ice cream sandwiches and HK egg waffles in other places  BUT  It is not a bad place to try out if you are willing to dedicate some time in lining up for it  And seriously  really nice food photos ,4,2015-09-15
I love love love taro ice cream  I finally found a place in Toronto that sells taro ice cream  Waffle was soft and fluffy which compliments the ice cream really well  The burnt toffee was a little too sweet for my liking but taro was perfect  Yummerz   I was in and out in about    mins which wasn t that bad ,5,2015-12-13
Best ice cream shop  No doubt   I am obssesed with Bang Bang ice creams     fan of the key lime flavour  so accurate  its like literally eating key lime pie   mojito  avocado  cinnamon toast crunch and  nocciola are my go to top     Definitely a must in the summer and even during the  winter  So worth it,5,2019-12-12
Tried ice cream in HK waffle  The waffle was not as sweet as the ones I had in HK  Mint choco chip and mud were both good  not very sweet either    problem is that the ice cream at the bottom of the waffle melts too soon and the waffle gets softened ,4,2015-03-14
I saw the photos of a hk waffle with ice cream and I specifically made a trip downtown just to try it  There was a huge lineup and we had to line up outside the store  When we got inside  it was a small little shop  but they displayed all their ice cream flavors up in big signs for everyone to see which was good  We were only able to taste test one flavor  They had quite a big selection and quite a variety of special flavors  I got the lychee rose and the chestnut with green tea  Both were very delicious  The wait was around    minutes after I ordered because it turns out that one of the the   waffle makers they had was not working  The waffle was kind of soft  and it was kept warm due to how they wrap it in to serve you so if you don t eat quick  it will melt  and the bottom of your egg waffle would be very soggy    I would definitely go back to try other flavors    A downside to this place would be that it is kind of far downtown  and not really near a subway station so getting there is kind of a hassle ,4,2015-10-16
So good  I ate the entire thing  The ice cream was smooth and delicious  A must try  Pictures is avocado ice cream with puff pastry,5,2017-10-30
One of the best ice cream dessert places in Toronto  They have a very unique selection of flavours e g  taro  earl grey  etc  You can get the ice cream in a scoop or in between a cookie  a nutella puff  my favorite        a Hong Kong style waffle  and a few other options  Beware  there is no seating inside and the line can get loooooong in the summer time during  peak dessert craving hours   It s probably best to enjoy the ice cream while walking around the Ossington strip or heading to nearby Trinity Bellwoods ,5,2018-08-08
My go to for ice cream  So many ice cream flavours to choose from  and different options to build your own  Very satisfying and yummy  also it s so sweet that they serve kid size scoops,5,2019-08-22
Had peanut butter chocolate   banana pudding ice creams in a fresh everything cookie  Full size    Many delicious sounding flavours      Mine was great   Very messy but pretty awesome   It would have been nice if their was more seating around  Maybe they can think of that if they expand one day    I d go back  For sure   Not cheap  But worth it  I wanted a waffle cone but was told    minutes   So next time hopefully ,4,2016-07-03
Yes this place is all it s cracked up to be  Amazing ice cream sammies  just make sure to pick the right flavour   The mint and burnt toffee are amazing  minus one star because I had the  surprise surprise   maybe shouldn t have ordered something that I didn t know was in it  but it turned out to be peanut butter and jelly    not so good  Somehow it didn t even taste cold if that is even possible  Regardless I ll be back and I m excited to try more flavours ,4,2014-07-22
I almost forgot about this place during my trip to Toronto  I had put it on my tentative itinerary  but because it was tentative  things got pushed around  Luckily I remembered and headed that way after dinner    What I hadn t been expecting was the line out the door and down Ossington Avenue as we cruised by on the streetcar  Apparently  they aren t messing around  There was no visible signage indicating  Bang Bang   but it does have an overhead hang that states ice cream  so I deduced that we were in the right place   We took our rightful position in the ever growing line and waited  And waited  And waited  It definitely took a long time  probably close to an hour   and then it took even longer because I wanted a waffle cone  Many people obviously didn t want to wait and chose other vessels from which they would devour their ice cream    However  whenever an ice cream place offers a waffle cone  I get that waffle cone  And in the case of Bang Bang  that s one of the things they re known for  Their HK style egg puff waffle cone  So I waited an additional    minutes or so for that waffle cone  probably to my boyfriend s disappointment   and I m really glad I did  It s really unlike any waffle cone you ve ever had  It s soft with the perfect amount of crispness  just sweet enough  and slightly warm from the waffle maker   In that waffle cone  I got the Lychee   Rosewater and London Fog ice creams  Friggin  delicious  I was genuinely impressed with the ice cream flavors and their quality  They certainly live up to my expectations  which frankly  are quite high  My boyfriend got a waffle cone as well  so he wouldn t have to watch me eat mine    minutes later  He went for the Mud flavor and didn t find anything extraordinary about it  but he also has a knack for choosing the least creative flavors   I had a bite  and while it was great quality ice cream  the flavor itself is boring  I prefer more  exotic  flavors  Ones you likely won t find in the frozen section of the grocery store  Mud was definitely one of those grocery store flavors  If you re adventurous  pick something you can t find at the store  You won t regret it   The staff were visibly busy  so there isn t really much to the service  other than  tell me what you want   The guy who took our order was nice and made small talk  but definitely don t expect that    Waiting for the waffle cone was a bit of a mess because there was no actual waiting area  They call your name when it s ready  and you re likely to be waiting outside  as there s no room inside to stand  And it s loud  so you won t hear your name being called amongst all the people talking    The chick who was working the waffle cone machine came out and got me  but I m sure they hate when they have to do that  It interrupts their workflow  I think a little more organization on their part would make this less of a problem  Things like dividing the entrance exit  so people can actually leave and cornering off a certain area for people waiting for their orders  could go a long way   Despite the chaos  the ice cream alone is worth future visits   Overall      Food      Service      Atmosphere     ,4,2016-08-11
Unique and exceptional ice cream place in hipster land   Always happy we went there   Usually get the ice cream sandwich and aspire to one day have the patience to wait for the incredible looking waffle cones  custom made ,5,2018-10-06
Bang Bang is Toronto s best ice cream shop  Full stop   It s hard to miss this place between the perpetually long lines and smell of freshly baked cookies  yup  their cookies are just as good as the ice cream  and other goods   They serve up an eclectic mix of ice cream flavours   most will blow your mind  My go tos are the caramel oriented ones like caramel something    flan  and the tea oriented ones  like london fog   You can even get your ice cream sandwiched between two freshly baked cookies  or their other baked items  if that s your thing   Unfortunately  this would have been an easy   stars but they seem to have resorted to a maximum of   flavour sample  which makes it incredibly hard to choose flavours  On my most recent visit  the lack of sampling led me to pick their honey flavour which was an absolute dud  Another inconsistency is the size difference between a single and double scoop   don t bother with the double  By eye  you won t be able to tell the difference ,4,2019-09-08
The wait is unreal  What s the fuss about   great ice cream  Avoid the cookie and waffle distraction  Stick to the ice creams  Yummy,4,2017-10-01
This place is a gem in the Trinity Bellwoods area  I come here at least  x a summer and am SO happy to announce that after all these years  they finally have a stamp card so be sure to ask for one  Buy    items  get a half ice cream sandwich or scoop   Their cookies are like crack and should be on a list of sinful desserts because they are pure butter  I swear  I recommend the everything cookie or the raisin date cookie     If you make it here before the dinner rush  then you re less likely to wait until frustrated and mad  there is virtually no line    Yes  I am telling you to ruin your dinner with dessert first  They have SO many flavours ranging from teas  fruity  classic  specialty  vegan    and seasonal  I ve tried most of the speciality popular flavours like ube  milk tea  earl grey  London fog  majority of the time  I get it with their egg waffles  which I do have to say is one of the best things in life   heart eyes  Their cookie flavours are also the bomb  Certain flavours are seasonal  and some of them cost more as the cost of ingredients availability has gone up from a few years ago    A half cookie sandwich includes two scoops of ice cream  though they are smaller scoops though   My boyfriend got the single scoop of milk tea ice cream  which comes with a spoonful of boba  Over the years  I will say that this place has held up their namesake of Bang Bangin  their way into my list of loves  Cash card      Estimated wait assuming you re waiting at the front of next door     mins or so ,4,2018-06-16
Ice cream is amazing  cookies equally so  But talk about  s   l   o   w  Be prepared to wait a great deal for your treat  Or just keep on walking and use your time for better things  Either way  you ll do just fine ,3,2015-07-27
I m not usually an ice cream person  but all I needed to hear is that they make coffee ice cream out of Sam James Coffee Bar Espresso  It was as delicious as you d expect it to be  and I will definitely be back braving the lines all summer ,5,2014-06-09
Probably the longest time Iv stood in a line to get an ice cream  I had huge expectations after    minutes in the line and it felt rewarding   their ice creams are just great  I have to try their in house waffles next time   we tried the burnt toffee and rocky road kill   delicious  ,5,2017-09-03
Very unique  Tons of different flavours  my favourite would be the cinnamon crunch and london fog  which you don t see often in ice cream joints  Only down fall is that the wait time is horrible and the staff are very slow  I waited in line for    minutes with only    people in front of me  There needs to be more staff or better efficiency  People will not line up for ice cream for that long ,4,2016-02-11
I will forever dream of this ice cream place   it s one of my top   ice cream places in the world  I eat a lot of ice cream  and this place is so unique and delicious   it s definitely worth a special trip out of your way to come here if you re in Toronto  If I had had more time in Toronto  I would have definitely come back multiple times  and I ll be back on subsequent trips to Toronto without a doubt   There are so many combinations of ice cream flavors  probably around       flavors  and choices of how to eat your ice cream  between two cookie halves  between two whole cookies  in an egg waffle  or a puff  kind of like a cream puff without the filling   Your head will spin as you try to decide between all the different permutations of options     I wanted the full ice cream sandwich  or the egg waffle  but it took all my willpower to get the half ice cream sandwich  As soon as I took one bite  I regretted getting the small size  although it s a decently large size   and then contemplated getting a second half sandwich so that I could try a different flavor  I opted for the mango pudding ice cream with sticky rice  sandwiched between a gingersnap cookie  It was beyond delicious and totally unique  My ice cream had a layer of coconut sticky rice in between the sandwich and the ice cream    Other unique flavors that they had  taro  chestnut with matcha  campfire marshmallow  birthday cake cookie dough  corn on the cone  london fog  orange cardamom  I don t think you can go wrong with any of the flavors   The cookie flavors seem to rotate   when I went  they had an everything cookie which looked delicious  gingersnap  cocoa  oatmeal raisin   date  birthday sugar cookie  a gluten free option  and probably something else I can t remember   My coworker got the birthday cookie with birthday cake cookie dough ice cream and it was amazing combination   highly recommend this  along with the mango pudding   sticky rice with the gingersnap cookie  The lines may be long  so be prepared to wait  I went at      pm on a Tuesday night and it was crowded but I didn t wait more than    minutes  They take cash   credit card only  so don t come with only your debit card  or you will be sad  It s a bit on the pricey side for ice cream   I think I ended up paying around     USD for   half sandwich ice creams   Come here once  come here twice   it s totally worth the trip  and the extra calories  Your wallet or your waistline will not be as happy  but your stomach will definitely be happy  Can t wait till the next time I can come back here ,5,2016-05-03
Being a big fan of ice cream  I m very much loving the surge in fancy ice cream places in Toronto   I make an effort to try out everywhere I hear of     Bang Bang has one huge advantage   ice cream sandwiches   The cookies themselves are delicious  as is the ice cream   They have all sorts of interesting flavours like London Fog and seasonal specials like Ontario strawberry   I ve got to say it s won me over for the simple flavours   The less fun part is the line   Bang Bang is really popular   Every time I ve been it s been around a       minute wait ,4,2015-09-27
This was as delectable a dessert as I ve had in a long time   The ladies of Bang Bang Ice Cream know how to do cookie sandwiches  take it from a diabetic   There are really two things that have to be done well   good cookies and good ice cream   First  there is an impressive collection of cookies  which was important because it opens to door to some pretty creative pairings with the selection of ice cream flavors  The cookies were fresh baked  firm but not crumby   so when you bite into your sandwich  you won t lose half of it on the ground   Second  the ice cream is sooooo good  I can vouch for the mint chocolate chip but there were just so many tasty flavors to choose from  Again the ice cream was soft enough to make for an eatable  and edible  sandwich   but not runny  The ladies were super helpful in suggesting a pairing   and there s even a list of popular selections to pique your interest while you wait  Its a small space so you ll have to take your dessert and go  Also be prepared for a wait   with so many selections  folks may have a hard time deciding exactly what they want  But it will be worth the wait    Last note   it was SO great that they offer half sandwiches  Perfect for those with little ones whom you don t want to overload with sugar   and for those of us working on our summer bodies  The half sandwich is more than enough   but it s so good you ll want to go back again and again ,5,2017-11-29
Worst customer service ever  I brought my   month pregnant wife from the east end for ice cream  We were behind the designated last person  Literally the next people  And they wouldn t give us an ice cream  The girl behind the counter yelled  no guys  I have exams   She denied my pregnant wife    never will I forget this horrible day ,1,2016-10-08
Dont know what the rave is about with this place   Everytime I passed by there was a long line up   I finally waited in line one day to try it out and it was nothing special   Over rated and over hyped   It s just ice cream  nothing special at all ,2,2017-09-19
Every time i come here i try a new flavour and they never disappoint   The only difficulty is trying to decide whether i want to try a new flavour or get my favourite jasmine ice cream flavour again   I was pleasantly surprised by the matcha jasmine twist they had this time   Please never discontinue the jasmine ice cream   Its the best  ,5,2019-10-27
Bang Bang Ice Cream  This place is definitely one of the top places in our dessert rotation    We ve been coming here for a few years now and we love their unique flavors but we keep coming back to their taro  hazelnut  pistachio or their chocolate ice cream  But that s not all  we like them sandwiched with their freshly baked rococoa cookie    In fact  the cookies at Bang Bang alone are worth visiting for  The only downside about Bang Bang is the endless queue but you know when a place is damn good when the line is long ,5,2018-08-19
I ve been waiting for this day and it finally arrived  I couldn t have been more excited   My cousin took me here after eating a delicious dinner   It was a little ice cream shop along Ossington   We walked in and there was hardly a line up   perfect timing   I ve heard that the line ups for Bang Bang is out the door  literally  While waiting in line  I examined all the different flavours of ice cream they offered and my eye went straight to the Tataro and the London Fog  both of which I heard really good reviews about    They even offer Vegan ice cream  which is a nice for those who are vegan   It s so nice how you can customize your order to as much or as little as you like   They offer a wide selection of sweets with your ice cream from cookies  to ice cream cones  to hong kong style waffles   My cousin agreed that he would taste test the Tataro and let me have a taste and I tried the London Fog and instantly fell in love with both   We decided that we would split one order in half and went with one scoop of Tataro and one scoop of London Fog ice cream with the Hong Kong Style Waffle   We did have to wait about    minutes before we got out ice cream but let me tell you  it is definitely worth the wait   The ice cream with the waffle is delicious and the perfect combination all in one bite   The ladies that work here are all very accommodating and very friendly   Even though it is a bit pricey for ice cream  I will definitely come back because I thought it was the best tasting dessert I have had in a very long time   Bang On ,5,2015-09-16
This place a kinda over rated  The ice cream is good and the waffles is a cute touch   but at the end of the day its just ice cream wrapped in Hong Kong style waffles    you can get at pacific mall for much less and add in ur own fav ice cream      Its a good thing that they make their own ice cream  But the line up and price is just not worth it  I would go there again only if the line is less than   mins wait       mins line up are just ridiculous when all you get is ice cream and hk style waffles that you can put together at home   ,2,2016-03-12
Summer hot spot  unique flavours and incredible service  Their ice cream sandwiches are a must even with a cinnamon bun  GO GO GO,5,2019-01-21
They have so many unique flavours of ice cream  I can t wait to go back and try more  The presentation is great  it s just too bad you it s not a sit down establishment since there was still line up the night we went even though it was raining  If you consider yourself an icecream connoisseur  you can t miss checking this place out ,4,2019-03-17
love their cookies  wish their  hk waffle  doesn t always  break down   i ve seen people getting it before me in line but when i got there  they said it broke down  pretty sure cause they were too busy and just don t want to make it  other than that  all was good ,3,2016-06-11
Been here multiple times last summer  I was in the area recently and was craving something sweet  Never disappoints  all the flavours are delicious  London fog  lychee and taro are a MUST try    Icecream in any weather  forever ,5,2018-02-23
Super yummy ice cream sandwiches   Tried the london fog   macadamia flavours within two peanut butter crunch cookies  This combo in particular probably wasn t the best  but the individual flavours were pretty tasty  London fog was nice and light tasting  Macadamia was nutty and creamy  but since it s an extra    I would have preferred to try the other flavours instead  Line looked long but everyone was served pretty fast  I really love how many unique flavours Bang Bang has  and would love to come back and try the rest ,4,2017-05-02
My favorite ice cream spot in Toronto  Usually has a line up but the few times I ve visited it was around       mins  Imo it s worth the wait ,5,2018-10-10
Bang Bang Ice Cream  I m feeling you  I hadn t heard of Bang Bang before my trip to Toronto  but as we were walking up Ossington  I saw a line up outside of the shop so we just joined in  Who ever said not to be a follower is just wrong because Bang Bang was worth that line    Waffles  ice cream  cookies galore  That cookie sandwich was calling to me  You can get a whole sandwich  two cookies with ice cream in the middle  or they will half it for you  The wall is lined with tons of ice cream selections and you can choose your flavors  They also had a killer selection of vegan ice creams and cookies  One of my favorite parts about Toronto is that vegan goods are a thing    Not like a  one we have one vegan flavor    like there were     excellent vegan options in EVERY sweet shop we went to  It s just part of their culture and I am feeling it  My date got the vegan option  but I ended up going with the sandwich with a birthday cake cookie and campfire marshmallow ice cream  Killer  Creamy ice cream with a perfectly chewy cookie    If you re in the Toronto area  stand in the line  Bang Bang makes it worth the wait ,5,2016-09-03
There is a great demand for Bang Bang ice cream  and from the first scoop  bite or lick of your ice cream  you can defiantly tell why  The ice cream is all made in house and a delicious variety of flavours are available  There are many ways to indulge with the options of a regular cone  sugar cone  bang bang waffle cone  puff filled ice cream pastry  cookie sandwich or just in a cup  you can t go wrong with any choice  One downfall is the wait for the waffle cone  it s about average    minute wait after you have waited about       minutes inline   I know sucks but the vibe is good on Ossington  lots of fun people to talk to  D so be friendly or just read a book while you wait  I suggest getting the burnt toffee ice cream flavour  my favourite  and comes highly recommended  If you get it with a cookie  I suggest the everything cookie  very delicious  Would defiantly go back  and don t forget to tip      ,5,2017-08-14
Place was really small and hard to find at first but it s a cute little ice cream parlor tucked in between a restaurant and a store   We had the oolong and London fog    it was really good   Nice tea flavor strong enough to make it distinct but not so strong that it s bitter  What a nice treat for the summer,4,2016-05-24
I was there in the winter and there was almost a line out the door  The choices are amazing and hard to decide  In addition to tasty ice cream  they also have cookies to make ice cream sandwiches  They have regular sizes for ice cream  but also offer snack size which satisfies your sugar craving without being sad about it   Can t wait to go back in the summer ,5,2019-02-25
Just ok in my books   I guess my expectations were HIGH after having this place bookmarked for a while  then finally able to go months after   Flavours were unique from the usual chocolate vanilla strawberry   However  the Earl Grey cookie sandwich thing tasted just like it sounds   It didn t  Wow  me or exceed my expectations   I believe it was     for half a cookie with the scoop of ice cream   I went at a weird time just  during slightly before the dinner rush  so there really wasn t a line   Service was quick   IF I was in the area again and felt like ice cream  I wouldn t be opposed to going back ,3,2015-06-27
Must Try  Espresso  London Fog  Cinnamon Toast     Golden Oreo  Cinnamon Bun or Cookie Sandwich are both great   Rating          Food         Service         Value         Ambience         Presentation          Cleanliness  One of my fav ice cream sandwich shops in the GTA  and from the line ups  seems like the favourite of a lot of people too  They have a rotating menu of flavours  so take the chance to try some of their flavours  When not busy  they let you try a bunch  but usually limit the numbers when they re busy    I personally love the Cinnamon Toast with the Almost Everything cookie  but the recent addition of the cinnamon bun has been a game changer  Most flavours with the cinnamon bun are stellar  The cookie cups  cream puffs and the egg waffles are both excellent additions to the menu  you can t really go wrong with any one  Cookies are also available on their own for take out    There is street parking along Ossington  or try looking on the streets adjacent for free parking    The shop often has long line ups  but when it s your turn  they don t rush you  too much   There s no real seating area  so you pretty much take it to go ,4,2018-11-27
Amazing selection of ice cream  waffles and cookies  Why I give it two stars though  is because they always seem to run by their own hours  Sometimes I come all the way down just for this but they close without any sort of notice  Make sure to call before you go or you ll just let your hopes down ,2,2017-05-24
After seeing all the reviews on Yelp I was really excited to try this place out  I got the London fog on a Nutella puff which was pretty good  The ice cream didn t taste much like anything but it was pretty light and creamy  The puff was a little dry with all the Nutella  but overall it was tasty     I ll definitely be back to try out the macaron cookie sandwich  Overall it was a good ice cream sandwich but I don t think it met my expectations after all the hype this place got ,4,2016-02-06
This is one of my go to icecream shops downtown   I love their flavours  taro is definitely one of my favourites  It s extremely creamy and rich  I would recommend just eating the icecream on its own without the cookie or else it s too sweet and overpowering  It s worth the wait ,5,2017-11-04
This is definitely the most popular and most talked about ice cream store    The cookie really complimented the ice cream and it was pure heaven  By far  the best ice cream sandwich shop Toronto   Their ice cream is off the charts good but I really only come here for the ice cream sandwiches   All of their suggested cookie and ice cream combos are delicious ,4,2018-12-04
Disappointing  That pretty much sums it up  This place is a good example of what good marketing and hype can do for a business in the short term until the next hype comes and it becomes yesterday s news    I was late for   minutes after the last order time and got a rude rejection from the exhausted staff so I made sure to be early the second night  Having waited for    mins in the line  I was told that I can only try one sample and the long line made sure I am in enough of a rush to order quickly    The ice cream was mediocre with very generous standards  the cookie was hard and not fresh at all  I think Dunkin Doughnuts can do better  and everything was very sweet for no good reason    Overall I d never go back to this place  Want a better ice cream  Buy a tub of Talenti or even Ben and Jerry s at your local supermarket and save yourself the wait in the line and the rude staff encounters ,2,2017-11-26
If you don t try bang bang  you don t know how good a cup or a waffle full of ice cream can taste  Yes  the wait is long  expecting a good    minutes spent here  I would suggest coming with a group of friends to make the wait a little bit bearable  Recommend the weird sounding favour  you won t get it anywhere ,5,2017-01-26
Best ice cream flavors I ve had in North America to date  I got the totoro  ube   purple sweet potato  and the coconut mango pudding with warm sticky rice and oh my god the flavors were bright and intense and the ice cream has the perfect balance of diary and sweetness  Sure it s expensive  like    Canadian dollars for   small scoops   but it s worth it for the unique flavors  high quality ingredients  and great execution   The lines are crazy long so come here during off hours  I arrived at  pm  before dinner time  and the line was already a half block long and took about    minutes before my turn  The reason the queue takes a while to clear is because of the sampling  the scooping ice cream into cookie sandwiches  and waffle orders ,5,2017-07-14
Bang Bang deserves all the hype  Although the long line up may at first be intimidating  it is much worth the wait  After about    minutes in the line  we were greeted by some of the most friendly staff I ve encountered in a very long time  They really made a great impression    The ice cream was to die for and the cookies the perfect consistency  Went with straight up vanilla and a good old classic chocolate chip cookie  Will definitely have to come back and try some more adventurous flavours  but sometimes you just have to keep it simple  Amazing experience overall ,4,2015-07-03
London fog is the way to go  Totaro is good as well  I probably shouldn t have gotten the cookie sandwich because that was just too gluttonous ,5,2017-08-13
This place is obscenely busy but with good reason  the ice cream is truly delicious  I got the sweet corn and basically blew a gasket it was so incredible  The options for flavours are endless and all are made in house  You can also get your ice cream with another sweet treat  like a waffle  cookie  or pastry puff  I had a cookie  but would probably get something softer next time to complement the ice cream texture better  It s wheelchair accessible  they have a ramp   although it s a somewhat clumsy entranceway due to the plastic curtain that hangs there  but manageable  Highly recommended for your excellent quality ice cream fix ,5,2018-08-13
Would have given it a   star if it wasn t for the    min   lineup  Also for those who mentioned the Nutella puff    It s fairly bland and hard  The cookies are definitely a better choice    Pros    great selection of ice cream   quick service    well priced for the amount of ice cream you re getting   Cons    lineup was literally out the door  We waited    min at least   and it want even summer ,4,2016-04-17
Surprisingly light for a heavy desert  Finally got to try Bang Bang the other day and wasn t disappointed  Waited around    minutes for a bubble waffle cone and was pleasantly surprised    The waffle itself wasn t nearly as heavy as I thought it would be  and the ice cream itself was great  Went with the Rocky Roadkill and Cinnamon Toast combination  loved it     Not to mention  the shop smelled amazing   Definitely try to go during the week or off hours  otherwise you might be met with a lengthy wait  especially if you re ordering a bubble waffle cone   since they make them on order  ,4,2017-07-05
This has got to be one of my favourite dessert places  First of all their service is amazing  Such friendly staff  even on such busy day they always have a smile of their face  Lychee raspberry  wtf  and mango pudding are absolute must try ,5,2019-09-23
I got their cookie sandwich ice cream since during the time I went there  summer   since there was an additional    minute wait for the waffle cones  I settled with   birthday cake cookies with   scoops of gelato   oolong tea and pink lemonade  I did like it but it was pretty expensive for it  I only visited this area because of the amount of positive reviews about this location but I would come back  only if I am in the area ,3,2016-11-27
What can be said about Bang Bang  It is the very reason summers were created  Or perhaps it s the other way around  I don t know    all I know is that if you want the best ice cream in the city  there is no other place worth going  And as someone with a gluten free diet  the option of getting a gluten free ice cream sandwich is sheer heaven  Get your tail down there and try out their  scream because it s incredibly  fantastically  stupendously awesome in every way ,5,2018-10-13
Can never go wrong with Bang Bang  Weather it s a hot day by Trinity Bellwoods or an ice cold evening in Toronto  if you re in the area   You HAVE to get Bang Bang Ice cream    Lychee Rosewater and Totaro are definitely my personal favourites  There are several other unique flavours you can try  Make an ice cream sandwich  waffle cone or just enjoy some ice cream ,5,2018-02-23
Oh the lines  lines lines everywhere in toronto even at  pm on a sunday night  We waited around      mins which gave us plenty of time to decide on the flavor and read yelp reviews  During peak time it s only one sample per person  We got the matcha tiramisu which had alcohol in it and the lychee rose water ice cream  In my opinion it wasn t worth the wait or the hype    Tiramisu one was really bitter and you can definitely taste the alcohol  And the lychee rose water was really sweet and fragrant  tasted like I m eating my facial moisturizer    This place is definitely just a one time thing  Will not be coming back ,3,2017-08-21
Bang bang is a bit out of the way for me  I am not usually in this area  But since I love anything Earl grey flavor  I knew I had to come and try the earl grey ice cream    There was a line up on a rainy day in the summer  Because it is so busy  they cannot offer too many samples since this slows down the line  The shop is small so I was really crammed once inside  There were people eating inside  ordering  and waiting for their order  It would be great if it was more spacious    I got the earl grey ice cream sandwich  The cookie was okay  I m not really a big cookie person  It was a tasty cookie but nothing special  The ice cream was delicious though  I love anything that is earl grey and the ice cream had a strong earl grey flavor  The ice cream was smooth and creamy  I will return for their ice cream ,4,2017-09-04
The peanut butter and jelly ice cream was amazing but the burnt toffee was average  The ginger cookie was really good ,4,2016-09-02
I know it looks like a crazy line  But I promise you  it s worth it  Love all the combo of flavors   and we ve had quite a few  the London fog  the genimacha  sp   tiramisu  the banana pudding  the Lychee rose water raspberry  Particularly one of my favorite  very crunchy bang bang waffle cone or egg waffle cone  Very good batter such that it doesn t get too soggy even when we got to the end of the cone  We ve came all hours of the evening  weekdays and weekends  The line is usually shorter earlier in the night ,5,2017-08-04
Visited bang bang today for an ice cream sandwich  Ordered half a double chocolate chip cookie w lemon meringue ice cream  The portion was huge  The ice cream to die for   Lucious creamy lemony goodness  Thx for coming into my neighbourhood bang bang  I ll be back again soon ,4,2015-07-21
Four words  London  Fog  Ice  Cream   Everyone has their favourites and the above is mine   Always packed but worth the wait   Loses a couple stars for long line ups and expensive price but if you don t have to wait and have some disposable income  ice cream is amazing   The extras are average but the flavours are what steals the show ,3,2017-06-26
Lines can be long but the home made ice cream and fresh baked cookies make it worth it ,5,2017-11-27
Love it  best egg waffle in town ,4,2016-05-03
I am obsessed with Bang Bang  The first time I went  had to wait in line for half an hour but it was totally worth it  A tiny shop with a long line up  You can tell instantly that they are also an Asian inspired boutique because you ll see the Hong Kong waffles  Furthermore  icecream flavors like red bean and ginger are other strong hints  The first time I ordered nutella profiterole stuffed with hazelnut icecream  It was amazing  and very heavy  My friend ordered cookies and cream in a HK waffle  Second time around I ordered matcha icecream sandwiched between two cookie cups  cookies were scrumptious but matcha was like any regular matcha from an AYCE Sushi restaurant  Burnt toffee icecream is their top recommendation and my friend had that sandwiched in between everything cookie  I thought it was alright  My favorite flavor out of the   i have had so far would be the hazelnut ,5,2016-11-19
Love this ice cream   The flavours are subtle and abundant   You won t feel sugar overload afterwards either   There are gluten free flavours too   There is a line up to get the ice cream but well worth the wait ,5,2016-08-08
Super regular ice cream on top of junk cookies or waffles Too much line up Don t recommend,2,2015-06-20
This place always seems to have a line out the door  and now I know why   Don t worry  it moves quick    Got the full ice cream sammie  which means you get to choose TWO ice cream flavours and TWO cookies   perfect for people who want a little bit of everything  And even so  I STILL couldn t try all the flavours that I wanted too    I tried the Matcha Genmaicha and London Fog  with a Ginger cookie and a RoCocoa one  The ice cream flavours were super rich and creamy and the cookies were tasty as well  HIGHLY recommend sharing with a friend though  because this was way too much for me   At about    for a full sammie  it seems a bit steep but if you share with a friend  and you should   it s totally reasonable ,5,2018-08-21
Best Ice Cream in Toronto hands down  Worth the wait in line    All home made ice cream with interesting  and unique flavours you can t find elsewhere   I tried the Hong Kong waffle cone and it was delicious  You have the option of choosing a macaroon or cookie base as well  Would love to go back ,5,2018-08-23
I d heard so many good things about this place  I was down to wait    minutes for ice cream and it was worth it  I forget what my ice cream flavour was called but it was chocolate  marshmallows and almonds  And I had it on a rococoa cookie avoid the cookies they re hard  stick with the waffle or regular scope  Overall good experience,4,2016-04-19
TL DR creative fun flavours with Asian inspired baked goods  The Boba flavour was really delicious  It was probably the least sweet ice cream flavour we tried at this place   it almost felt less sweet than to put     sugar bubble tea  You could really taste the tea in the ice cream which is something that we really appreciate it    The honeydew was also a very refreshing flavourful taste   we could tell that was made with real fruit  And lots of it    The chamomile and honey flavour was our personal favourite   just because of how different this flavour was  Whenever we order chamomile flavoured ice cream  it never really taste like the real thing  This is more than delivered in providing the pure flavour of the chamomile    What we could have skipped out on is the lychee rosewater raspberry  we thought this would be best one but it was just a bland sweet fruit flavour  Very one dimensional ,4,2019-06-01
Amazing and unique selection of ice cream flavours  Best ice cream shop in TO ,5,2016-12-13
Always busy with a line up out the door  but their offerings are so delicious  I can understand why  Their ice cream is all fantastic and made in house  as are their baked goods  When I visited  I wanted to try the macaron ice cream sandwich  but they were out of macarons  which was disappointing  I settled on a cookie ice cream sandwich  I was not disappointed for long  because both the cookie and ice cream were so good  I can t wait to return to try another baked good with a new flavour of ice cream ,4,2016-11-04
The first couple of times I came here I thought it was only ok  but they ve improved a lot since they opened   The cookies are softer and the ice cream flavours and the best in the city   My personal favourite is the birthday cookie and key lime pie ice cream   It stays on my mind for days after I ve eaten it   It s worth the       minute wait in line ,5,2016-05-27
This is my favourite ice cream place in the city  They have unique flavours that you would be crazy not to try  Also the cookies that they make the sandwiches with are some of the best cookies I have ever had  The line up is long but it s worth it  ,5,2016-06-13
Wow  thank you for making Ube Ice Cream  It is my favorite and very hard to find  Surprised and happy to see it in Toronto ,5,2019-08-09
Amazing baked goods and desserts  I got the ice cream sandwich and soon after went into diabetic coma  Would do again ,5,2016-11-19
The egg waffle was really good  And the ice cream too  Mine is burnt toffe and Lychee Rose ,4,2018-07-14
What a delightful ice cream shop in Toronto  This place is a SCENE late at night  We went on a Saturday night about       minutes before it closed and there was a line stretched from the inside of the tiny shop down the street  It was a warmer than normal day so we decided to brave the line  If you have the luxury of choosing  I d try going in the afternoon to avoid the inevitable line   Let s talk ice cream  shall we  Bang Bang makes its own crazy unique and often Asian inspired ice creams from scratch  Also  and this is very important   they also make their own fresh  cookies   Sooo  if you ve put two and two together  that means you can customize your own amazing ice cream sandwiches  They have some ice cream   cookie flavor combinations suggestions on the door if you can crane your neck over the line to see better   Unique flavor choices for ice cream include things like matcha tiramisu  lychee rosewater  and boba milk tea    I sampled the burnt toffee ice cream which was super rich and creamy and had a generous amount of crunchy toffee chunks throughout  so I decided to get that on a     cookie sandwich  The staff member helping me  suggested that that ice cream works well on the  everything  cookie  chocolate chips  pretzels    peanut butter   so I went with his suggestion  and it was MIND BLOWING  They even drizzled some toffee syrup on top ,4,2019-04-20
Ice cream sandwiches doesn t get better than this    Wish the line up wasn t too long but definitely worth the wait  Bang Bang is a weekly ritual in this household ,5,2015-06-20
Interesting flavors and great staff  The line ups are silly  especially in hot summer days but are worth it ,4,2017-08-06
I always leave happy  They have so many flavours and options for every dietary restriction  I have come back time and time again  My top two favourites are the ginger milk and earl grey  My boyfriend really likes mud  The cookies and pastries are really good as well  although I prefer not to make ice cream sandwiches because they re hard to eat and get messy ,5,2016-10-13
LONDON FOG ICE CREAM IS ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE jk but no really it s so good you really should get this flavour with whatever you plan to order  on the side note i got the pb cookie to try and the cookie tastes good however it s slightly too hard for my liking i found it kinda hard to eat in conjunction with the ice cream imo  anyway  i saw a lot of people get their order or hk egg waffles  my friend also got it but since the waffle was warm and fresh  it just kept melting the ice cream to the bottom and got a little messy to eat  just a heads up you guys  take some napkins with ya,4,2015-09-07
Ordered the Espresso ice cream on a Birthday cookie  and it was  dare I say it   not that great  The ice cream was creamy and flavourful  but the cookie was just not good  It was bland and really difficult to eat   I definitely would not go back for their cookie ice cream sandwich   but I do want to try their HK waffle cones though ,3,2014-08-19
Not at all bad  Just to be clear  But I really don t see what ALL the hype is about    Let alone the crazy line that forms there on some days    The ice cream was good  we tried London Fog  the toffee one  and a vanilla  but the cookies were way too sweet for me  and a bit hard  Just made the ice cream sandwich really tough to eat without making a huge mess    The waffle was different and tasty  I d go in that direction again versus the cookies  And definitely go during off peak hours  It s not worth hours ,3,2015-07-11
I always wonder will places like this live up to the hype  long waits  multiple recommendations saying that you must try this during your stay in Toronto and far from our downtown hotel  Well  it did       The wait was manageable at around    minutes on a really nice day  The line moved quickly due to their efficient process   Ice cream sandwiches   The Everything Cookie with Chocolate was excellent  It s more about the ice cream than the cookie due to the Everything Cookie being very thin and a little dry  The Everything Cookie with Burnt Toffee was good  but my least favorite  I didn t think that the Burnt Toffee was really memorable given the other two flavors we had   The Everything Cookie with Milk n Cookies was awesome and my personal favorite  The ice cream might have been the best or definitely top   best cookies and cream ice cream I ve had so far    I would definitely recommend trying this flavor   Cookies  The Oatmeal Raisin Cookie was good  moist and denser  The Everything Cookie is nothing special on its own  The cookie is too thin and doesn t have strong flavors on its on  maybe this is the reason it pairs well with the ice creams    Since it was out of the way  I don t know if I would go back  but I m so glad we tried it   ,4,2016-08-23
We were concerned Bang Bang might be another  hype  at first   But after    minutes of waiting in line and finally  able to sample a few of the flavours  we were ready to indulge   So much so that we didn t mind to wait for another    minutes for their home made waffle cone   the BEST     My personal flavour was the lychee rosewater raspberry  such delicate taste   We didn t have time to try out their other bake goods  but we certainly will come back once we re in Toronto again ,4,2017-08-14
We had a bit of a wait       min  on a Saturday evening  I don t think I would ve waited longer than that  The ice cream i got  vanilla bean  was good  and I got it in an oatmeal cookie sandwich  Thing is  you gotta eat these fast otherwise it melts and you re a mess while trying to stuff your face with ice cream and cookies  I want to try the HK waffle next time but definitely not going to    min      Overall  I guess it was worth the hype   but wasn t the  best  I ve ever had  The sample of the dulce de lece was way too sweet so I went for the simple vanilla bean  which was much better  The oatmeal cookie   on point  super soft and chewy  Too bad this place doesn t have more sitting areas  other than that  I enjoyed my ice cream ,4,2015-08-16
Yes it lives up to the hype   I was lucky and got there on a Sunday early afternoon      pm  and there was no line  Got to try several flavors  lychee rose water raspberry  melon  totaro  no not Totoro the forest spirit  nor is it taro  but it is ube      Ended up going with the lychee on a regular cone     omg actually a reasonable price unlike most other ice cream places that charge        I ll have to come back  again early in the day to beat the line  to try sooo many other flavors  Next would probably be matcha tiramisu  or maybe rocky road  or just go with the ube     oh so many choices and only so much stomach  ,5,2019-07-21
On the strength of the Key Lime Pie ice cream cone  I say mmmmmmm   To have this iconic dessert translated so perfectly into ice cream is pure witchcraft  I have tried it elsewhere  but Bang Bang s got the ice creamy  dessert decadence with just the right hint of tartness and pie crust bits    The price is right compared to other places  just under    per muscular scoop  NOT a disappointing little fashion ball  tax included  and they don t charge you extra if you happen to use credit  like at other places   I am down to pay cash just to make sure they get every bit of due  Service was fast    All this   hassle free bit o heaven   I also ate a decadent chocolate cookie ice cream sandwich  with nut clusters and marshmallows and almost passed out  Had to wait   minutes for the dense ice cream to melt a bit just to get my teeth in it     Be warned  tho  Bang Bang is sadly closed on Mondays cuz  apparently  they have to make ice cream sometimes ,5,2015-07-28
Amazing homemade ice cream and ice cream sandwiches  you can even get a gluten free cookie   Enough said ,5,2018-09-12
We ve waited about    minutes on line for this  I would say it was worth the wait  The place itself isn t that big of an interior and due to the long line of people you won t be able to stay in the store for long after you ve received your order    The service was really good and they were nice in letting us try different flavors since there is so many  flavors to choose from and they all sound so good  From the flavors that I have gotten was the Thank You Very Matcha which was so good  My brother who doesn t even like matcha also enjoyed it  The Golden Oreo however was pretty sweet  A huge oreo ice cream fam but thought that this one was kinda sweet  I would definitely stop by again if I had a chance and the cookies just made it    x better ,5,2019-08-04
Went here on a Sunday morning   there was no lineup  that was a surprise  but there didn t have any macaroons  bummer  so decided on the Nutella puff with the London fog ice cream  excellent choice     I ve heard that the London fog is often sold out and now I know why  It is heavenly creamy goodness and was a great combination with the Nutella puff since the ice cream was light but the Nutella was rich    I love that they serve Sam James coffee  It s my favourite   Looking forward to trying the SJCB espresso ice cream next   Another great thing about this joint is the seating outside  No tables but its a nice place to chill  finish your dessert  and watch the Ossington action   Would definitely come here again and recommend it to everyone ,5,2014-08-19
Waited in line for about    minutes on a weekend in June  When we got to the front of the line  they said it would be another    minute wait for a waffle  so we opted for ice cream sandwiches instead  It was delicious  Especially on a hot day    definitely worth the wait ,4,2016-06-22
Long lineups so be prepared but they are pretty quick  The ice cream is soooo freaking good   The serving size is HUGE so you should share with someone  I will be back ,5,2016-08-28
The lineup is scary  You walk drive this place and it s obvious that it s the bright and shiny new place  You line up for    mins to get two cookies and some ice cream  Is it worth it   So I had the vegan cookie with Havla ice cream  Usually I love black sesame ice cream so I thought Halva  white and black sesame  would be great  But  I think it needs slightly more bite   It was a generous portion of ice cream and big cookies  but for        well I m just not sure   I like the simplicity of the place and how it s ironically next to a restaurant that just seems to be its opposite  With the tubs of ice cream in background with names of what they have  no need for anything more   I also like how they have a fair amount of servers to just grab your order  Any more and they need a bigger kitchen   I think it s worth one more trip to try another flavor combination  But right now  as result of long line and underwhelming flavor combination that I chose  I m not sold yet ,3,2014-07-18
I went to Bang Bang on a sunday early afternoon with a friend  the line was not too crazy  about    minute wait   The interior looks and smells very nice  but you probably won t be staying in there for long  especially on weekends  Staff are super friendly and are pretty quick with getting your order and making your ice cream sandwiches  HK style waffles does take quite a bit longer though    I ordered a half london fog on ginger cookie  I really enjoyed it overall  The creaminess and spot on flavour of the ice cream was great  but surprisingly I enjoyed the cookie even more  The cookie was soft and chewy yet crunchy around the edges  I m a fan    I will probably return to try the black tea flavour and buy some cookies ,4,2015-04-27
Bang bang ice cream is worth ALL the hype  The cookies are perfectly chewy and not too sweet which compliment the ice cream  The peanut butter ice cream was so creamy and LOADED with Reese s pieces  The passionfruit sorbet was tangy and sour which acted as the perfect palette cleanser for all the sweets  And the matcha genmaichai had the strong tea flavour,5,2019-07-17
Ridiculously over rated  Definitely go at a non peak time   the line isnt worth it  But the ice cream is still delicious ,3,2017-12-07
You have got to check out this place for delicious cold creamy ice cream    Not alot of space but you can walk and lick lol   The flavours are great with White Oreo  London Fog  Cinnamon Toast  Matcha and more  They offer the Big Bang Waffle Cone  freshly made   it smells amazing   homemade cookies  or puffs    Check them out  Also they re open in the winter which is great for us Ice Cream Lovers,4,2018-01-18
DAMN  SOOO good  so i guess you know already but here is the deal   Over    flavours of amazing ice cream    different types of cookies that are incredible  Now make an ice cream sandwich  HECK YES   I want this every day,5,2016-08-09
Yes  this place is still expensive  Yes  this place still has a line out the door on a sunny weekend day  but damn  It s really good    Bang Bang has expanded their repertoire to include other baked goods aside from the cookies for their ice cream sandwiches  I highly recommend their Peanut Butter and Jelly ice cream which they almost always have  and their cinnamon buns  Bang appetit ,5,2019-05-24
I ve been dreaming about these waffle cones  The ice cream was delicious and the vehicles shot the ice cream to a whole new level  I m lost for words because all I can think of is getting my hands on those hot waffles again   Go here  ,5,2019-09-07
We always pass by Bang Bang while in the Ossington neighbourhood   The Bellwoods Stout ice cream is surely one to try  especially with the ginger cookies  I would recommend just getting a half ice cream sandwich unless you re going to share with a friend immediately  I take big bites but even the second half started melting quickly before I got to it  Grab some extra tissues    Service has been pretty inconsistent the     times I ve been  The lines can be very slow and the staff don t seem to be in any hurry  A couple times we stopped by  they were closed despite hours indicating they were supposed to be open  maybe they were all sold out   Still worth a try ,4,2015-06-28
My foodie roommate  Keith  says Bang Bang is  the best ice cream he s ever had   That sums up our experience at Bang Bang    It s a TINY ice cream shop that has rightfully won countless awards and nods from food publications for their ice cream and ice cream sandwiches    It s just north of West Queen street in between West Queen and Dundas and on a street with countless of top rated shops and restaurants  If you go  go on a week day and early  It opens at  pm and most days they have a line even before it opens  We went on a Wednesdays at  pm and only waited    minutes   Due to time  they only let you sample one flavor so pick wisely  I ordered the campfire marshmallow ice cream  nope  it wasn t too smokey  with their  stay classy  cookies  basically chocolate chip cookies   It was worth every penny    Note  There s an ATM inside  but it s not cash only  They take cards ,5,2018-06-04
There are long lineups at this place for a reason  The ice cream is amazing with several different flavours and the cookies are freshly baked  Definitely worth it ,4,2016-09-24
I wish most places have a name that starts off with Bang Bang  it is simple and to the point and that is something their yummy ice cream is known for  I would go back and try every flavour even if it means to forfeit my new years resolution because I will be gaining pure awesomeness by Christmas   ,4,2015-11-14
  words  Burnt Toffee ice cream  BOMB  For a late night snack  this met all my wishes  I imagine that it would be great any time during the day too  Give it a shot ,5,2019-03-22
Daaaaaaamn    two words    london fog   it was incredible    i have never enjoyed an ice cream more than the london fog  Sure  the line up was ridiculous and it took over    min to finally get into thr place to order  but I m glad i waited because in the end  thr flavour of ice cream made up for the crazy long wait ,4,2017-08-13
Love london fog with the roCocoa cookies  Tried the Boba papa but I didn t like the texture of the boba  although the ice cream tea flavour is impeccable  Initially went for the lychee but it s sold out  Anyway it s worth the long queue   service is prompt,4,2019-07-07
Some of the most delicious and interesting flavours can be found at Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery   I always like get their oolong tea and longdon fog flavours  Their taro ice cream is just OK for me  Also  their bubble waffles were mediocre   That said  not every thing here has to be perfect  Just know what you like and come here for that    I heard that the re famous for their ice cream cookie sandwiches  Can t wait to try that next ,4,2018-11-02
Heard many good review of the location and decided to visit it  It wasn t as packed as I thought would be  quick in and out on weekend  I believe may be the timing of our visit  I would recommend to avoid long wait time is to go during lunch hour or before    pm  The selection consist of variety for different foodie  they offer free sample of ice cream tasting which is a plus in my book  Overall  enjoy the experience and price was fair  However  it was not what I expected from the review  Definitely  it is worth for a try and great tasting ,4,2018-08-11
I love the ice cream choices here  delicious  I wish the crepe was a bit crispier ,4,2016-05-13
Went to Bang Bang on a Monday night and surprisingly there wasn t a long line up   we only had to wait about   min which was unusual  I ordered the Totaro and Black Tea ice cream flavours  The Totaro was my favourite as it was a gorgeous purple colour and had pieces of taro in it   so good   However  my favourite place is still Kekou ,4,2018-07-01
I miss bang bang Ice cream so much    Best cookie sandwiches I have ever had  This place has a variety of combinations to choose from  and the reason why  I choose this place was for how unique the ice cream flavors were too  I took a picture of the menu so you can see yourself   In addition  it s not just cookies  you can do a whole arrange of options like cinnamon rolls or waffles  The very unique thing is that i was able to choose two different types of ice cream for a half cookie sandwich  They really do take the time to make sure you get what you want and specialize to your needs   The only default is that we did have to wait in line for a while but I can assure you it was actually very worth it   The man who assisted us was very accommodating  He gave us his personal recommendations when we weren t sure what to get   Amazing choices  Bday cookie with Cinnamon Toast and Golden Oreo RoCocoa cookie with matcha tiramisu and totaro,5,2019-11-24
I ordered an extra large ice cream sandwich for my bf s birthday  It was amazing  every one of our guests polished their plate and asked for more    The ice cream sandwich needs to be ordered at least a day in advance and they prepare it the day of ,5,2015-09-21
My go to place for ice cream  They have every flavour imaginable and the names are plastered all over the wall for you to choose from   If you want to skip the line  youre able to grab pre made popular cookie ice cream combos from the freezer and pay   It s a bit far from the central area being at Ossington and Bloor  and lines can be long on weekend nights  longest I ve waited was around    minutes for egg waffles   but if youre not in a rush  then it s definitely a place to check out ,5,2016-09-07
Delicious  delicious  I m so glad to be trying this out in September  not having to line up for hours  I absolutely love the idea of Asian style ice cream joint  I had the Hong Kong waffle with the  Thank You Very Matcha  and  Maltese Me  flavors  Absolutely wonderful    I will definitely be coming back in the summer to try more flavors and perhaps in the Nutella Cream Puff Shells ,5,2016-02-06
My friend and I finally decided to make the    minute trek over to Bang Bang this past weekend and I have to say my life has changed for the better  Although many people would think this walk coupled with a    minute line is a bit insane for some ice cream  I can confidently say that it was totally worth it   After careful deliberation we decided to indulge in half of a Burnt Toffee ice cream sandwich on a Everything cookie and half of a Fresh Mint ice cream sandwich on a RoCocao cookie  Although I had originally planned to purchase a whole ice cream sandwich for myself  the large portions meant that half was more than enough  Both of the sandwiches were absolutely amazing however the Burnt Toffee ice cream sandwich was by far my favourite  The Burnt Toffee ice cream has large chunks of sponge toffee which come as a delightful crunchy surprise and the Everything cookie is truly what dreams are made of  Although the Fresh Mint ice cream was out of this world  the RoCocao cookie was not sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth   To wrap things up  I recommend picking up any of their overdone cookies when you are there  I snagged a Captain P nut cookie at the checkout and with a quick heating in the oven  that cookie was worth so much more than the    cents I paid    Definitely will be visiting in the future ,5,2016-06-07
Great selection of flavours   always something new to try every time  I personally don t think it s worth a   min wait or longer  but if it s less than that  I ll stop in  They bake their own cookies in house  and churn all their ice cream onsite    My favourite flavours are avocado and taro   consistently decent    Ordering a fresh made bang bang waffle can take up to    minutes to serve when busy    Don t show up hangry   you ll wait longer than you think ,4,2016-09-26
If the lineups weren t enough of an indication  this is the best ice cream in town    My personal favourite would have to be the London fog  However  as a lactose intolerant person  my body prefers the raspberry vegan ice cream on the birthday cake cookie  which has the loveliest hint of lemon     People tend to line up before it even opens at  pm on weekends so expect a line no matter what time of day you go  You can find their flavours online but be aware that they only have about half of them available at any time  Some classics like London fog are almost always available  Also note that they only take cash and credit ,5,2017-08-07
Was leaning towards   stars but when I discovered their mango pudding with coconut sticky rice  it was so good  it had to be    However  when I got it last week  I m almost sure I just imagine what I tasted the first time  The rice was cold so there was no sticky factor  Just cold  hard rice in ice cream  If you re about the life  congrats  but that s not for me   So   stars because they have a large array of flavours and there s quite a few decent ones that you might not be able to find as easily elsewhere ,4,2019-05-01
Ok yes they have a great idea  great ice cream  waffles n cookies    But seriously they r very slow  quewing for   mins n at the end no waffles nor paper containers to hold the ice cream   Of course i ended up with nothing    I dont think i will come back  I can bake the stuff n eat it happily at home without that lonnnng wait ,1,2014-08-18
This is so good I m writing the review as I eat it amazing waffle cone the feel of the store was great I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves ice cream,5,2017-02-18
best London Fog ice cream I had in my life      stars because of it s crazy line up when it is sunny   no place to sit down and eat ice cream either  And pint to go is not available during busy times which makes me sad  However ice cream is just so good and wish I can grab its ice cream easily ,4,2017-12-01
I finally came around to giving Bang Bang a try and I must say it was just a hype    I came around     PM on a Sunday night and I waited in line for about    minutes  during my wait they put up a sign that they were down to only one waffle machine and waiting time was about       minute from the door  Which is a pretty long wait just for ice cream  but my friends and I still opted for the Hong Kong waffles    I ordered the Hong Kong waffles and chose Key Lime Pie and Lychee Raspberry with Rosewater   The Key Lime Pie was really good and tart and there were pieces of gram cracker crumbs in it too I would definitely get this flavour again  as for the Lychee one the taste was very faint and overall just like sweet water and I didn t like it as much   When I got my ice cream the waffle wasn t too hot that it melted my ice cream right away so I was happy I could take my time and eat it without having soup at the end of my cone  The waffle doesn t taste like the ones you d get at Chinatown or Hong Kong in general  the shell was very crunchy and darker than the usual  it taste kind of like pancake batter and inside was rather hallow than cakey    Overall  the flavours I tried were delicious but I wouldn t get a bubble waffle again if I returned ,3,2015-09-21
Review   Visited it again and we had a jolly good time stuck to burnt Toffee ice cream w peanut butter cookie  Will definitely come back if in the area and lineup is not crazy  no more than   mins in the summer  ,4,2018-03-11
Was here on a hot weekend and the service was EXCRUCIATINGLY S L O O O W  I cannot emphasize this enough  It also didn t help that I was standing behind a guy with one of the worst cases of dandruff that I d ever seen  But I was determined to get my ice cream after waiting nearly an hour  despite being like   th in line    I think they need to get more practice at making those HK waffles   I think that was the large hold up   The person who helped me also gave me the wrong flavour  Plus I don t think he charged the high school kids in front of me   I suspect that they just walked off with their ice creams and none of the staff noticed  I also don t like the wooden popsicle sticks they give you to eat the ice cream with  becaues they can and will break  especially lengthwise  Plus they are short so you re more likely to get ice cream on your hands   Now that I know that this is an off shoot of Bakerbots  I think I d much rather go back to Bakerbots instead since they are right by a subway station  their service is MUCH faster  and I can always count on their having the Rococoa cookie  which is divine   My favourite flavour at both places is the London Fog   creamy happiness in a cup ,2,2015-08-24
We went in not sure what to expect but it was definitely hard to find and we accidentally drove past it   The menu on the wall has all the items they offer sadly no prices so it was a struggle to order because everything sounded delicious  It was a bit intimidating because I felt rushed like I usually do in small ice cream shops    So after much thinking I decided to have a nutella  profiterole with espresso half sesame ice cream  Bf ordered the everything half cookie with hazelnut ice cream  He felt the cookie wasn t as soft as bakerbots  But I loved my profiterole because it was not too sweet and the ice cream didn t melt as fast  So I can t wait to go back  ,4,2014-07-22
Super delicious icecream  And totally worth the lineup    however I was lucky to come on a day there wasn t one  keeping in mind I have waited about five years now to try it ha ha    I recently visited this ice cream shop not expecting to find that they also serve very delicious baked goods such as carrot cake and delicious cinnamon rolls    This time we went for the bubble waffle cone filled with buttered mint and lychee rosewater ice cream  With a side of butterscotch ice cream     The flavours here are amazing and very rich  It is infused perfectly and worth the price  They have a variety of different flavours so many that it is very difficult to choose  And also they offer delivery with Uber eats   Uh oh I am introuble           recommend this place    ,5,2019-10-22
The only place I d go for ice cream in the winter  Thee best ice cream shop in all of GTA  Well worth the live up  The ginger cookie is my fave  So many delicious flavours  London Fog  taro  lychee  mint  chocolate       ,5,2019-03-10
with all the hype I was expecting a bigger baby   flavour was okay buy over the top see for my taste and nothing too creative,3,2018-10-26
Hands down  best ice cream  My go to is the bubble waffle   London fog or Milk and Cookies flavor  Crazy how they make their ice cream in house  the flavors are so unique and rich  Also  staff are always so friendly ,5,2017-06-25
It was a slightly cool evening both times i visited this place in the last three weeks  I don t normally like eating cold things on a cold day   But Bang Bang changed all that  Tried the London fog  Tataro and Banana pudding so far and it wasn t a let down    However  it is beyond me why a place that is always brimming over with a crowd won t invest in more equipment for faster service   I waited for    mins both times i was there   Is this a business tactic to up the allure of the place   It s not acceptable that a business would care less about inconveniences they put their customers through  Time to up your game Bang Bang  ,3,2016-05-11
There s always a line outside of Bang Bang Ice Cream for a reason  And the reason is because it is extremely delicious and irresistible  The hardest thing you ll have to do here is to make a decision about what to get  They have so many creative flavors that if you don t come with an idea about what you wanna try then you ll annoy the heck out of the staff and the people waiting behind you  They also have a selection of baked goods  And if you don t mind your cookies or sweets a little bit on the overcooked side then grab one at a discounted price near the check out counter ,5,2019-11-28
  SERVICE    Updated May          The cashiers now LIMIT ONE TESTER PER PERSON  There s a sign that says this applies when there s a line up  BUT I went during a time on a chilly rainy day and there was LITERALLY NO ONE BEHIND ME  and one of the cashiers was still unwilling to give me an extra tester   That s kind of lame Bang Bang   at least limit it to two testers or else how are people going to decide on getting one or two flavours      OVERALL   Although I haven t been liking the service at bang bang lately  their ice cream is great and I ll begrudgingly come back for more   haha,4,2018-05-20
I can t believe it s taking me this long to write a review for this ice cream place   It s worth the wait  Honestly  If you do not like to wait  then don t wait but don t give a review based on wait times or how there are no places to sit there  There are   you just got to find it      I have been a fan since it s opened  I have waited in a line with both of my dogs  will have to take me latest addition to the family  and  I have been happy with their HUGE selection of icream  I pretty much tried     of the flavours and I have been happy with all of my choices  Same with my spouse   Yes there is nowhere to sit BUT you are steps away from Queen St  West with tons of shops and cool things to do  Same with Trinity Bellwoods  Honestly  there are no reasons to complain  Bang Bang is SO WORTH THE WAIT  You will always have my business       happycustomer,5,2017-07-27
Overrated ice cream place with longggg lineups during warmer months  Busiest hours are   to close  They are instagram worthy if u want a nice photo of ice cream and their different mix and match options  I like their bobba ice cream   unique and tasty without being too sweet  Ice creams are more on the creamy and heavy side,3,2018-06-12
I Was swinging by my favorite pho restaurant when I noticed a long line forming down the street    I soon realized it was bang bang   And I ve been hearing nothing but great reviews about this place  Decided to give it a shot and we had the macaron ice cream sandwich  The Nutella bomb cream puff   The Nutella bomb was mind blowing  The pastry was nice and airy combined with the hazelnut ice cream  it was a divine combination  As for the macaron sandwich  the concept is interesting but the textures dont work for me  I found the macaron too hard and it was hurting my teeth while eating it  My friend got the Hong Kong egg waffle with cinnamon toast ice cream and that was fantastic  Reminded me of the waffles at Pacific mall but with good ice cream  Overall I d come back to try the rest of the items ,4,2014-09-16
Some of these other reviews are hilarious  Are you     actually complaining that the ice cream     melts  Like      actual ice cream is supposed to   Ridiculous  That aside  a friend and I stopped by here a couple days ago while wandering off Queen St  and our minds were sufficiently blown  She ordered the London Fog  earl grey tea  and I had the Bellwoods Beer and Brown Bread on a cone  Incredible  The London Fog was very subtle in flavour  so no bitter aftertaste that often comes with tea infused desserts  The Beer and Brown Bread was where it was at though  Despite the dark  malty scent  the ice cream base itself was almost floral  And the pieces of brown bread were divinely sugared  buttered and toasted so that they became these chewy cookie like nuggets when enveloped in the base  So  Good  They also gave free samples  The cinnamon toast tasted very promising  But I m currently devoted to trying the Miso Cherry next  Yes queen  Miso Cherry ,5,2015-04-05
The line up always looks so big but they tend to go quickly  I recently went in and waited about    minutes in line and my friend really wanted a waffle but there was another line up for that      minutes  I m sorry  but    minutes for a waffle is ridiculous and  hour for an ice cream waffle is even more ridiculous  I swear the booths in Chinatown make whip them out like no tomorrow   The ice cream is still good but be warned  the birthday cake cookies and ice cream have sweet lemon flavour  It surprised me because I paired the birthday cake cookie with a chocolate ice cream which don t really compliment each other   I still like Bang Bang  but the line ups are getting a bit crazy ,3,2016-05-18
Amazing ice cream flavours and variety   I would recommend eating the ice cream sandwich with a puff instead of a cookie if you want to avoid a mess ,5,2015-09-19
It s always a pleasure experience eating their ice cream with the Bang Bang waffle   I had the London Fog   the avocado favours ,5,2017-08-24
I came here a couple years back  There was a gigantic line waited over    minutes  I had the Big Bang waffle with londonfog ice cream  They make their waffles from scratch gigantic waffle extremely fluffy and really moist and the ice cream is incredibly delicious  You can also get this card from them if you order a certain amount of ice cream you can get one free you stamp the card every time you go to bang bang  It is a bit far for me but the ice cream is really delicious,4,2018-12-31
Liked it  The line was very long when I first visited  They had a great variety of selection to choose from  the ice cream wasn t the big thing for me but it was the waffles  Soo good  The ice cream isn t was stood out for me but it was the soft and chewy  Just didn t like the wait time haha,4,2018-10-09
A line up  In the cold  For ice cream    This better be good   we mumbled  The peanut butter and concord grape jelly ice cream   yo  We noticed the baker was the same woman from Bakerbots  pumping out cookies galore  We ordered the PB J and banana pudding ice cream in the Hong Kong waffle  Both ice creams were decadent and creamy  my favourite being flavourfully chunked full of peanut butter globs  The waffle was fairly  eggy  in flavour but it worked  The ice cream here surpasses anything I ve tried in the city ,5,2015-04-26
I was so excited to try this place after seeing my Instagram news feed blow up with pictures  Thankfully the day I went  weekday in the afternoon  there was no line up but that also meant they did not have what I wanted   Macarons  Instead I settled for the london fog  to die for     ice cream sandwich and it did not disappoint    However  would I want to make the trek there again to possibly hit a long line up to wait for a macaron ice cream sandwich  I don t think so ,4,2015-04-22
Good  tasty ice cream  but not mind blowing   Waited in line for    minutes to try   flavors  burnt toffee and mango coconut pudding  Both were really good  but not sure if it was worth the    minute wait  I got it in a sugar cone instead of cookie Hong Kong waffle cone  Would I try this place again  Yes  but only if there s no line   Lines move snail speed   ,4,2015-09-08
I am here literally every week  I have a love hate relationship with bang bang  Love their black tea and London fog flavour but hate that they are so addicting   I always come in the afternoon on weekdays since I know how crazy busy they are on weekends  I always get the hong Kong waffle         with   scoops of London fog  black tea  Totoro is a little different than your typical taro icecream but good too  Avocado taste amazing   It s like a frozen avocado smoothie in my opinion  Their service is amazing too  they re all friendly folks ,5,2015-10-17
Awesome place  short line up and excellent ice cream selection  My favorite is their Hong Kong waffle ice cream style  Although it is a bit pricey  it is worth the splurge once in awhile  Great place to take a date on as well because the surrounding area has tons of stuff to look around ,4,2015-12-29
Terrible service  I waited    minutes to be treated rudely by the cashier and to be sold a pint that was already half melted just from waiting in line while people whom were behind me got served first simply because they were buying a cone  By the time I got home it was a soupy mess that spilt everywhere and so had to be thrown out  Completely wasted my money  Although the ice cream was great  the overall service was disgusting and so I could never see myself going  back ,2,2019-09-22
The London Fog  earl grey  in an almost everything ice cream is aaaaamazing    Buttery chewy ice cream w  chocolate  coconut bits  etc    creamy early grey ice cream    mMmmm   Be prepared for a long line  especially during the summer months   And this place is very inconspicuous w  no sign indicating what vendor it is   By the way  you re only limited to one tasting    Good luck choosing ,5,2016-02-21
Came here after seeing all the instagram pictures   It is a very small take out shop with only two workers  one was uber slow        I got the London fog ice cream half sandwich with everything cookie  Let me say  if you like Earl Grey tea  I am beyond obsessed  you need to try this  It is so creamy and smooth with a real tea taste  Combined with the chewy cookie  it was amazeballs  That s right  I said it  AMAZEBALLS   Also tried the lemon meringue ice cream which was good  tasted like lemon sorbet  Sour if u like that stuff   The mint chocolate ice cream was also really bomb too   good bomb  not terrorist bad bomb     The only macaroons left was the chocolate one  which my friend tried  He said it was very good  he accompanied it with banana pudding ice cream    All in all  very good ice cream  I couldn t really care less about the cookie as it wasn t the main star here  Cookies with ice cream in the middle sounds good   but the ice cream makes it cold and cold cookies are just very  mehhhhh   Cons  slow workers  long lineup  and hard to find the place  barely signs    I would recommend this place   Gonna try bakerbots next ,4,2014-11-09
This place showed up on my list because I searched Yelp Toronto for  ube   I intended to get a pint of ube ice cream to bring back to a friend s house  but there were so many other options that ube ended up being the least interesting flavor  and we decided to go without it   If you know me  this is a pretty compelling argument for the variety of flavors they have at this shop  because I m basically an ube addict   We walked out with three pints  The genmaicha matcha tiramisu is exactly what it sounds like  with bits of soft tiramisu swirled within  Delicious  We also got the salted caramel  which is a flavor found in many other places  but it s particularly excellent here  We also ended up with the miso cherry  which was one heck of a curve ball  and so weird and delicious that we needed to have more of it    Stop reading this review and make your way over right now  Plan to get one pint per person  You won t regret it ,5,2018-11-24
By far my favorite part about visiting a new city is seeking out  and often waiting in line for  their flagship ice cream shop  Surely Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery is Toronto s best  and it was worth every minute of my forty five minute wait on a Friday evening    Star    How were the service and atmosphere   Yes  the lines at Bang Bang can spiral seemingly out of control  but the neighborhood is conducive to it  there s signage  and above all else it s worth it  Even though they re surely swamped at all hours of the day  the servers are friendly and efficient    One of my favorite parts of Bang Bang was that  to keep things moving  they curb tasting during peak hours  which honestly makes a lot of sense  Think about it   when you go elsewhere  to say a restaurant  are you able to sample what you order beforehand  Of course not  and in this case it s a reasonable trade off to keep the line moving  Star    Star    How were the portions relative to the cost         CAD got me a colossal ice cream sandwich packed with two full sized scoops  While I initially scoffed a bit at the price point  after a quick bit of math I realized that for well under        I was getting two scoops of specialty ice cream and two everything cookies  which was a bargain  Star    Stars   and    How was the food   I don t have enough superlatives in my vocabulary to describe how amazing this all was  For starters  the everything cookie is a new benchmark for amazing cookies  and I could have eaten a dozen of these and been perfectly content  From there  the Burnt Toffee and CinnaCrunch ice creams were absolutely out of this world  and competed easily with some of my favorites elsewhere around North America  Amazing  Two Stars    Star    Would you be excited to go back   This was some of the best ice cream I ve ever had  and surely Bang Bang has perfected the dessert shop here in Toronto  Star ,5,2019-08-18
I think we were the first customers coming in that day  they open at like  pm  a small store with very limited outside seating and limited I mean like only   chairs  They have a lot of different variety of ice creams and you sample  we got the London fog which is earl gray  it has a very strong tea flavor and also got the hazelnut which tasted like ferrero rocher    Yummmmm  So I love the ice cream but when sandwiching with the cookies I just think it doesn t go well together  it s messy and hard to eat and too be honest the cookie wasn t that good  a bit too hard for my liking  Next time I rather just get their ice cream in a come or cup,3,2014-07-20
Staff was friendly  I m not a huge ice cream fan so didn t understand the fuss  Wait was far too long so I didn t like that  And I felt it was overpriced for what you get    I d come here again but only if the lineup is short and I m really craving ice cream  which is rare ,3,2015-08-17
Came here after dinner around     pm  Lineup was about    min long   Wasn t that hungry so I got the half cookie ice cream sandwich  I chose the lychee and rosewater ice cream sandwiched between two peanut butter cookies   I enjoyed both the ice cream and cookie   Portion size was good and costs was reasonable   Saw other people order the waffle ice cream and it looked really good   Will definitely try that out next time ,4,2017-08-04
I can understand the long line up  The ice cream is oh so creamy and fresh and delicious  It s not super sweet has the right consistency and isn t overly flavourful  Just light and fresh   I still wouldn t stand in that line though   got there at at time when it was luckily empty   But definitely a good ice cream spot if you re in the area ,4,2014-08-02
After reading rave reviews of this place  we finally decided to make the drive to Toronto  Wait was about thirty minutes  typical on a Saturday afternoon   I realized the line build up was because they were only serving one person at a time  You order  then have to wait for them to make it  then wait to pay    We got london fog in a nutella puff  london fog with birthday cookie  ginger milk with almost everything cookie  Total came to about      Pricey for one cookie and one scoop of ice cream  The ice cream was good  not overly sweet like most are nowadays  Puff was kind of dry and small    Although I can see why people like this place  They have inventive ice cream flavours with little add ons and treats that change in a daily basis    Sadly  I will not be coming back here  Only because of the long wait line  I didn t find it to be THAT good that I would stand in line for half an hour ,3,2015-08-17
All the flavors are unique  Instead of eating ice cream on a regular wafer sugar cone  there are puffles  HK cake waffles   various array of cookies  and profiterole puffs    It s a must try  If you re in Toronto  GO   ,5,2016-05-30
This is a place a little bit remote and small  even have no place to sit down and dine in  But not hard to find  The only thing you need to do is find this street  then find the busiest store on this streets  The only store on this street which has a long queue will definitely be Bangbang Ice Cream shop  There is a long queue after it opens all he time    The service is pretty good  Although the store is busy  They are explain your confusions patiently  They allow you to try the flavour before you buy it  Also they serve the ice cream very quick   You can choose your container among waffle cone   Egg waffle  cookies  and just a cup  They have many choice of the cookies  The flavour of the cookies seems to be changeable after a season  I spit of the ice cream  their cookie is delicious as well  Although the cookie is big  you can choose to have the half  And you can have two favours in your cookie to experience different flavours    They have a variety choice of flavour  We have tried   flavours first time   totaro purple yam   taro   The flavour of purple yam is very strong  It has the coconut chips in the filling  It is very surprised to me   avocado  it combined with the fragrance of avocado and the cream  Although the cream and avocado are both greasy  this combination take this concept away and make a fresh and smooth feeling in this flavour  London fog  the flavour of the tea is just right  The taste of London fog tea is very strong but there is not astringent feelings of the tea  And the cream and sweet is just right  Not so sweet or so greasy  STJB  I was first shocked by the name of this flavour  Because they have the other flavour of coffee  I never consider it is a kind of coffee flavour   And I never heard this flavour since I went there  It is the best coffee flavour I have ever tried    This is really a must try place in trt  I d like to take an hour traffic to get there for a scoop of ice cream   I will try more flavours in the future  Maybe I can try the whole menu then ,5,2017-06-10
This place would ve been a five if I just got the ice cream but I got the half sammie with the ginger cookie and that was disappointing   The London Fog  earl grey flavor  ice cream was excellent though   Super great flavor and great mouthfeel   Mmmm    ,4,2015-06-05
Ice cream is pretty good  Being in Toronto  people would like up for a paper bag and Bang Bang is no exception  In summers  Expect to wait       minutes to get your fix unless you buy the packaged ice cream from the freezer  They have a variety of cool  heh  flavours and it ll be great to one day try them all   Since it does get so busy though  they should consider not allowing samples during peak periods  It really holds back the line as some people are just too indecisive ,4,2018-09-24
I still remember when Bang Bang first came to Toronto couple years ago  everyone was raving about it and it was all over social media  I thought I d give it couple months to cool down  but after stumbling upon a review couple weeks ago  I learned that you ll still expect a line up there  I followed my YOLO approach and paid a visit on a weekend  risky  The line went slightly outside of the door but the store itself is tiny  Everyone was crowded inside the store  and everyone outside the store tried to squeeze in  yuck    They could definitely have had a sign or had someone to organize the line  I had absolutely no idea who ordered  who was in line  who was waiting to order  and who was waiting for their food    After being nice and letting people around me to order  I thought maybe it was my turn  I got the london fog in a nutella puff  Waited for almost    minutes  in the tiny crowded store  for my much anticipated Bang Bang Ice Cream  I had high expectations for Bang Bang  but not unreasonable  At the end of the day  how much better can Ice Cream Gelato get    London Fog was different  but only decent  Tried my friend s Matcha flavour which in my opinion  is a billion times better than the London Fog  The selection of their Ice Cream is worth   stars  but the poor organization and slow service was a definite turn off ,3,2017-04-11
It doesn t matter if it s freezing outside  even at    C this place will be packed  I have been here enough times to fill up my loyalty card with their stamps  So my next ice cream cone is on the house    yay  They have so many different options and every time I visit I see new ones  I have tried the Totaro  Nocciola  my favourite so far   matcha  cookies and cream and ginger milk  All of them have been really good   Their waffle cones are definitely worth the wait if you have never tried them before  I also like that they have a curtain to keep the wind and cold out  They only allow   tasters per person if you can t make up your mind like me     And don t forget to ask for the loyalty card ,4,2017-12-06
I literally have to give a bad review  only because I m PMSing and I m SO upset that the ube flavour  Totaro they call it  wasn t available today  Been craving it for months  So today I got the Wasabi one scoop and first lick  it was okay  Tasted a little bit like vanilla with wasabi flavouring  Then it just got too much didn t finish the whole thing cause tbh it was gross and I threw it away     Wasabi now stuck in my throat and I hate it   ANYWAY  bad review not for the hate on wasabi but because I didn t get ube   Oh  had London Fog the first time  it s very strong in flavour  earl grey   almost like grandma s perfume ,2,2016-06-30
We went on a fairly chilly summer night  waited over    minutes in their long line that forms on the sidewalk  In all honesty  I was really excited  hence I waited so long  yet I was kind of let down  They had various intriguing flavours that you wouldn t normally see at just any kind of ice cream shop  but I found that the flavours were not all there  The texture of the ice cream was great  just not as strong in flavour as I would normally prefer  They had options for either in a cone  cup  waffle and also make a into a sandwich with their enormous cookies  however I found it fairly pricey for ice cream   Very small intimate shop  very cool decor and very inviting and modern looking ,3,2018-01-30
I have been to bang bang twice and both times i ordered the totaro ice cream because it tastes too good for me to want to try something else  The coconut chunks pairs well for the taro  aka ube  and it is not too sweet   I picked up   tubs of ice cream  it was     price    don t judge   from them before they closed for the month of January and i still prefer totaro  Chocolate hazelnut was too sweet  i prefer ice n cake s hazelnut gelato   I would like a stronger earl grey flavor in their london fog ice cream  Their thank you very matcha is good  but I think Tsujiri s ice cream has a stronger matcha kick    Their baked goods are ok and make a fun vessel to transport the ice cream into my mouth  but if I were to order to only a sheet of egg waffles I would recommend Tung Tung Dan Quen King  which is cheaper too  ,4,2017-02-08
The best ice cream in Toronto    Pb and j is my favourite  Very friendly staff  and i love that the owners are usually there  Shows that they care about their craft and their customers ,5,2016-05-01
Their flavours are amazing  I especially love their Totaro flavour  taro  and the avocado ice cream  it tastes like an avocado smoothie  like the ones you would get at Pho restaurants    I usually get them in a bubble waffle  Lines are long during summer but it is worth it for wait  Their tea flavoured ice creams are also good  the earl grey and matcha  for tea lovers ,5,2019-02-17
It s over hyped  I didn t like it that much  I think I also went with high expectation but I wouldn t make it a regular place that I attend for my ice cream if I lived here in Ontario  Not saying it s the worst but this being the place everyone suggested I was sad about it ,3,2019-08-18
Years ago  when Bang Bang first opened  I braved the cold to wait in an hour long line to get some Totaro ice cream in a bubble waffle cone  It was good  but nothing too memorable that I forgot about this place and moved onto other ice cream spots in the city   Fast forward five years  after dinner at Mamakas  I decided to give Bang Bang another try  This time  the weather was just above freezing  but fortunately  there was no line up    I got a small cup of the burnt toffee flavour  Now this  was delicious  A sweet creamy base with bit of crunchy toffee topped with a toffee drizzle  I savoured every bite  It s been two weeks since I ve had it and I m still thinking about it ,4,2019-11-19
Interesting selection of flavours that are a well balanced mix of nouveau to the classics  I had the matcha genmaicha blend  which had real bits of genmaicha  rice tea  mixed in  I appreciated it because the genmaicha cuts down on the sweetness and gives it a more sophisticated flavour profile   Will definitely return next time I m in town ,5,2019-12-05
Be prepared for long lineups on a hot summer day or evening  London fog ice cream is the bomb  I got that in a half sandwich with the ginger cookie  My husband got the Maltese me flavoured ice cream on the birthday cookie  Both tasted very good  Worth the lineup ,5,2015-09-07
Even on a cold day in Toronto  it s the perfect treat yo self dessert  I got the London fog and taro ice cream in an egg waffle  which was just so amazing  The ice cream was the perfect amount of sweetness  and I love that they re such unique flavors  Only complaint I have is that the egg waffles lacked a bit of flavor  But I ll definitely be back     ,4,2016-04-10
Cute little ice cream  cookie  Nutella puff bakery  Friendly service and lots of ice cream cookie flavors  Totally missed the store even though I walked passed it three times   Burnt toffee ice cream is soooo yum ,4,2015-02-21
Finally got around to trying out Bang Bang Ice Cream after seeing all the rave reviews and Instagram snapchat posts from my friends  I d say it s ok at most   I really think it s just the hype though so I must admit I was a bit disappointed  I d say     to   stars   The wait was really long  especially if you order the HK Waffle     I was told the wait would be       minutes but it was definitely longer  I think part of the reason is that they were burning the waffles so they had to remake some   they only had   machines  When I did get it the waffle was too crunchy and so hollow    LOL I love HK waffles so I was so sadddd about this    The ice cream  on the other hand  was really good  I ordered the Lychee rose water and Totaro  I tried my boyfriends London fog ice cream and it was pretty good  if you re into herbal flavoured desserts    I might come back next time to try out their cookies and for their Ice cream  but the HK is not worth it at all  especially for how long you have to wait too   My boyfriend and friend finished their cookies and cone at least    minutes before I even got my waffle ,3,2017-05-22
BANG BANG   YOU SHOT ME DOWN   BANG BANG  Fuhhhhhhhhhhthaticecreamsandwichwassofuckinggoodicanhaveanotheronebutileft    Got the full ice cream sandwich with banana puddin   hazelnut with the everything cookie  That everything cookie tho   it just took it to the next level    Get yo ass an ice cream sandwich  Enjoy it  Get another  Cause I wish I did ,5,2018-12-09
An  everything  cookie with pina colada ice cream and a mud ice cream  It was SO good combined  Yum  I highly recommend those flavours ,5,2016-03-27
Delicious  if you choose the right flavours but not worth the   hour wait hype in my opinion  I went with two friends and I m the only one that was satisfied with what I got    It was an  everything  cookie with burnt toffee and cinnamon toast crunch  It was SO good combined  Yum  I highly recommend those flavours   As for my friends  one of them got the vanilla in an  everything  cookie and the other got the espresso in the nutella puffs  both were very average  The nutella puffs are better on paper I guess    Quite a disappointment    I d come back if I weren t to wait in line for more than    minutes ,4,2015-07-27
Mud   Love it   Get it     SJCB  Fudge   Almonds     Deliciousness     I always think I m going to try something different but this is my go to flavour ,5,2018-03-29
Located Westbound towards Ossington and Queen  very far from the tourist trap that is Sweet Jesus  This is hands down my favourite ice cream place in all Toronto   Most likely when you go you ll encounter a line  even in the winter time  but it is very much worth the wait   Bang Bang has an assortment of flavours to choose from and a few ways to enjoy them  Two scoops will set you back roughly        but it is definitely worth it   Their ice cream is home made and it shows in the quality  Every bite is a wonder  My go to flavours are  Totaro  Taro   Rocky Roadkill  and Mud   You can have their ice cream in three ways  a bowl  sandwiched between a cookie  or in a waffle cone   I ve tried the ice cream sandwiches and I suggest splitting or eating half as they are definitely filling  I actually much prefer the HK Waffle  aka Bubble Waffle to some  but it may take a while due to popularity so take that into account if you don t like waiting too much   If you re looking for some quality ice cream and don t mind making a trek away from the core then Bang Bang is what you re looking for   The only downside I can think of is the typical Toronto line ,5,2016-07-31
This place has the best ice cream  The best earl grey ice cream  London Fog   I ve tried earl grey ice cream at quite a few places and bang bang definitely has the best  There is usually a line that is at least a    min wait but today there was barely a line  Blessed  However we did have to wait for the egg waffle  Wait was about    mins    Their matcha was really rich and strong and sweet and all those just blended so well together to create a balanced awesome flavour  The roasted pineapple flavour was also good if you re into that  You can really taste the roasted pineapples and it had tiny pineapple bits in them  Their totaro which is their taro flavour is good and it has some shredded coconut bits in it  Their avacado ice cream is one of my favs  So so so good  Can t get it as good anywhere else  Definitely a must try  I also tried one of their new flavours  It was their boba flavour which was basically milk tea and it came with some tapioca pearls  It costs       extra FYI  But worth it     This place has the best ice cream and the price is not bad at all  It cost about      for double scoop  I would come here all the time if it wasn t that far ,5,2018-06-04
I stopped in here the other day after seeing a post about it on BlogTO  I do love a good ice cream sandwich  I got the classic vanilla on a chocolate cookie  First of all  it s huge  The cookie could stand to be a little softer  when I bit down  the cookies kept squishing all the ice cream out the sides   but it was still delicious  Great variety of flavours  I will definitely go back ,5,2014-06-21
BANG   BANG   BANG   BANG   BANG    This was the best ice cream experience I ve had in my life  OMFG    If you re new to Bang Bang just look for the long line outside  For some reason the sign above the entrance reads  Ice Cream and Bakery  or something like that  Bang Bang is carved in wood in the right window  Very easy to miss    The line goes very fast  Keep in mind they only allow one sample  so choose wisely  I ordered the everything cookie with the seasonal flavor Miso Mon Cheri  My mouth exploded  We sat outside the entrance  ate our ice cream and people watched  Best night ever  Make sure you get there    minutes before closing  They re friendly but they will cut the line off about      minutes before closing time  even if they re fresh cookies still available   This place is really small and there is no space for indoor seating  If you re not into the whole ice cream sandwich thing  you can get ice cream alone  ice cream in a waffle cone  ice cream inside a pastry puff  or ice cream in between a cinnamon bun ,5,2016-10-18
I kept seeing pictures of their waffle cones on Instagram and after going  Bang Bang definitely lived up to the hype  Definitely a     for the atmosphere of the store  quality of the dessert and service  The waffle is just like any regular waffle you can get anywhere HOWEVER  with the combination of their ice cream  it was fantastic  The best part about eating the waffle cone is at the end when you re pretty much done with the ice cream and wishing you had more but then realizing that the waffle has been soaking up the melting ice cream   Their London Fog ice cream is probably one of the best ice creams I ve ever had  The Totaro  taro  was good too  but I ve had good taro flavoured ice cream at other places before  I hear their avocado flavour is another great one to get so I ll probably try it next time I go     The service was great but a little slow  There was only one customer in front of us so we didn t have to wait too long but I can see the waiting times increasing exponentially when there are more people  The server was super nice to us and split our waffle cone into two servings  We didn t know that this was an option until we heard the girls in front of us getting it  Essentially they cut the waffle into two and put each piece into a little cup  you have the choice of putting one full scoop of ice cream in each cup or two half scoops of each flavour  This is great for sharing with your friends or when first trying out their flavours ,5,2015-11-04
I love their ice cream sammies  I hate the long queues though  How it works is that you queue up for       mins  choose an ice cream flavor  then you decide if you want a full sandwich  with   cookies   half sandwich    cookie broken into two parts   HK style waffle  Plain puff or nutella puff  You have many different cookies to choose from  oatmeal  PB  Ginger  Birthday  everything cookie  chocolate cookie  stay classy  They have     flavors  many of which are very unique   We tried London fog  very popular  and Lychee Rosewater Raspberry  We loved Lychee Rosewater Raspberry more   We tried the ginger cookie and the everything cookie  We found that the ginger cookie was overpowering the flavor of the ice cream   PS   The child in me would have given   stars if it were not for the long wait times  But maybe the child in me would have wanted instant gratification ,4,2018-08-29
Somewhat    Absolutely a    I only go for ice cream during winters or colder days and I always make sure I visit bang bang ice cream  I specifically love London fog flavour on cookie sandwich,5,2019-03-16
So after a number of years    i finally decided to check out this place  yes in the winter time  to get some of their ice cream to try  and WOW  my mind is blown  I love that they have different flavours  but not only that  those flavours change by season and the combinations are the most intriguing  It wasn t a very busy night on a Thursday  so my friend and I were lucky enough to try a few flavours before deciding on what to get  I ordered the     sandwich  it was huge  with the burnt toffee and everything cookie  OH MY GOD it is delicious    the cookie was nice and soft and paired perfectly with the burnt toffee ice cream  Obviously my stomach cannot handle more than that  so i ended up pinting a few flavours to take home  Aside from Burnt Toffee  a few of my now favourites is the lychee rosewater  for those who want something lighter and not too heavy   boba milk tea  London Fog  mango coconut  miso cherry  taroro  and because it was holiday season recently I got the salted honey with ginger milk flavour as well  I also got the egg waffle the second time I went back and it was so amazing     I will still make my own ice cream lol  yes i have an ice cream maker at home   but from time to time if i want a delicious decant unique flavoured treat  I ll def be back to Bang Bang again     p s  both nights I went the staff who worked on Thursday nights were super friendly and super nice  I took up so much of their time sampling and asking questions ,5,2019-01-11
Great flavours at this sweet little shop on Ossington   My fav are London Fog and Cinnatoast  Get the cookie Sammie s   Tons of cream  obvi  so lactose intolerant people plz be aware  Tried avocado and thought it tasted weird ,4,2019-10-12
The name of this place is nowhere to be easily found on the storefront  so if you re having trouble locating it  look for the long line of people standing outside down Ossington Avenue   My opinion would probably lean toward  not worth the over thirty minute wait   but that s not to say it was bad  You wait outside until you get to the extremely crowded and cramped interior space  The staff friendliness ranges from extremely positive to meh  depending on who you get  We had a gentleman in glasses and a pink ball cap who actually cared that we were from the Midwest United States  WE don t even care for the fact that we are from the Midwest   Better than the ice cream is the handmade waffle cone  all bulbous and such  It s probably the best waffle cone I ve had  It was bangin   See what I did there   Ahem  anyways   yeah the waffle cone is very soft and complements the ice cream well  Which is good  since the ice cream doesn t hold particularly well and needs a little bit of help  I have a tendency to not be blown away by ice cream at any given place  and rate ice cream joints heavily on the quality of the ice cream and the interesting ness of the flavors   Although what else would you rate an ice cream place on  I guess   As many flavors as they have  I don t feel like the unique ones are particularly appealing   Mud    Coffee and Cigarettes   What is that  Cigarette ashes sprinkled onto coffee ice cream  Just kidding  I read the description of it when I was there  It still sounded disgusting   I commend the Bang Bang gang for giving it a shot  and if I lived in the area  I d probably be glad it existed  It s just that I had better ice cream places in Toronto  I d say it is average  but hey  there are worse things than average  Below average  for example ,3,2016-08-09
With the summer almost in full swing  it never is in Canada  I can think of few things that can provide the delight of good ice cream  This place is quite good and fulfills one s needs for a good scoop   There are quite a few flavors on offer here  some might sound bizarre but the one s I tried were quite good  The ordering part can be a bit confusing at first but here is what I figured out you pick the scoop and then you can have it on its on or decide to make sandwich with a variety of cookies or just have it stuffed  I settled with macaroons stuffed with a scoop of espresso  they use Sam James beans   The macaroons were bad but the ice cream made up for it   We have a winner here folks I would say if you like ice cream just make a detour here and try a scoop on it own  I will be back ,4,2014-06-07
Equally as delicious as Bakerbots with very similar flavors of icecream and cookies  They have a bellwoods stout icecream that is amazing  The only downfall is you likely will have to wait    minutes to get an icecream sandwich  They have small pints of icecream for takeaway as well ,4,2015-02-28
Ice cream is really creamy and there are so many flavours it s really hard to pick every time  Once you figure that out then you need to figure out what you what the ice cream in  Cup  cone  Hong Kong waffle  cookie sandwich  the list goes on    The only draw back is the line is crazy for ice cream  They need more people working or some way to make it more efficient ,4,2018-06-25
This would be my favourite ice cream joint in town  Their flavour are very rich and pronounced and very tasty  London fog is my favourite but I would also recommend the totaro  taro   This is how a legitimate taro ice cream should taste like  It is very reminiscent of a classic taro ice cream from Taiwan  Rich  deep flavour  Black tea is another one  It s like bubble tea in I ve cream form  Also feels like Taiwan  Maybe the ice cream dude went to Taiwan and got inspired    I always get it in the puff  Just finish it off like a sandwich when you work down the scoops a little  I also really liked the Bellwood stout but I have never seen it come back  It was perhaps a limited run  The ice cream tastes like beer  When s the last time you had an ice cream that taste like beer     If you see that come back let me know  I ll run downtown just for it    Long lineups are expected but I ve been there when there were quick   I think they are light off the dinner hours  Long line up expected anytime during the summer months though  However I assure you that the wait is worth it ,5,2016-01-17
Too long  didn t read  I tried to think of a witty tag line related to  bang bang  but all I could think about was the excellent ice cream     just go   Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery is small shop with standing room only serving ice cream  sweets  and coffee espresso of all varieties  Staff are friendly and service is uber quick   especially because you will probably be waiting in line out the door  at all hours of the night    There are endless ice cream   cone   cookie combinations to suit any desire  but I paired the Ontario honey flavoured ice cream with a ginger cookie for a       ice cream sandwich   absolutely amazing  Opt for the full sandwich if you re willing to split or feeling over zealous    Overall impression  will go back   I urge you to go ,4,2018-11-09
Found this place after having dinner at Pizzeria Libretto  about   blocks away  We walked in and was haunted by the aroma of fresh baked cookies  The cookies are used to make homemade ice cream sandwiches  There were multiple flavors of ice cream to choose from  with cute names I might add  I went with their rocky road and mint chip inside their homemade waffle cone  Their waffle cone is different from the ones you are used to seeing  The cone looks and feels like an actually waffle  Got mine hot from the waffle iron  which didn t help with the ice cream melting quicker  The bottom of the cone is not sealed  might want a tray to put under it before you get it all over yourself  But this place was sure good and worth the stop ,3,2017-12-10
They have HK waffles and Macaron sandwich icecream  need I say more  There is usually a       minute lineup but definitely worth a trip  I highly recommend the Avocado icecream   ,4,2015-05-08
Love this place  Favorite is the London Fog ice cream with the ginger cookie  It s actually so delicious  There s always a long line for this place  Probably not as much in the winter but during the summer it was very popular  One could be waiting       for an icecream  Their sister company Bakerbots  Bloor Ossington  is also good and less of a lineup ,4,2015-11-15
Fantastic ice cream  I got the Totaro Taro  flavour which was very delicious  The ice cream sandwich cookie was a bit harder than I expected so took off a star for that but overall wonderful place  Second time I got the waffle with Totaro and Earl Gray  Both were fantastic  The waffle wasn t anything special but still enjoyable  Overall great experience  Would highly recommend visiting ,4,2016-07-19
Flavors here are on point   MMMMM   Be ready to stand in line for    minutes  or more  I went on a Thursday night and got a half sandwich    I got the Totaro  taro flavored with taro chunks   in a cocoa cookie  The cookie was really good  but i couldn t finish  it because it was really sweet  I also tried bites of the lychee rose water  London  fog  earl grey   and the golden oreo  I m going back to get my own lychee rose water before heading home to NY for sure  So many flavors  to choose from  It s really busy so the servers are under pressure  Try to have your order ready before getting to the front   Lighting is better inside for photos ,5,2017-07-28
If the line up is long   it s definitely worth the wait  I took my friend here since she wanted dessert and it was her birthday   Amazing can t even sum it up  I ordered the peanut butter cookie  I think that s what it s called  with the vanilla bean ice cream  It was scrumptious  My friend ordered the birthday cookie and the hazelnut ice cream which she kept raving about   We will be back again very soon  Looking forward to it     This place is better than Booyah ,5,2015-08-29
The line up was long but the ice cream Sammy was good  I had the birthday cookie combination  Half was enough as it is really rich  U better know what you want or else the line will get impatient with you ,4,2015-05-24
The lines are outrageous for this little shop  Be prepared to wait in line outside before you can even walk inside  Thankfully the staff were very efficient  so things moved quickly once inside  They re specializing in ice cream sandwiches  and had a few unusual flavor ice creams in addition to the standard options  If you re in the area and enjoy ice cream  I recommend it  I wouldn t go too far out of your way though ,3,2018-08-30
This place is great because each part of the ice cream sandwich that made them famous is tasty  the cookies are crunchy and chewy  and the ice creams are rich and super flavourful  I now usually just get the ice cream itself  if you like mint chocolate chip  get  fresh mint    herbaceous and chocolatey like stracciatella  Also the vegan flavours are delicious  specifically the chocolate which is water based  but you would not notice  it tastes like     dark chocolate be warned    Most times I ve come there hasn t been more than a      min wait  which is a relatively long time for ice cream  but there s a notoriously   min  wait ,4,2016-08-11
One of the best ice cream I ve ever had in my life  And that s saying a Lot    Usually H agen Dazs and M venpick are my go to    Since I read up on it before I went I was looking forward to some of the flavors posted recently online  However when I got there they had changed the flavors I was craving for  What a disappointment  But not is all lost  With    plus flavors I m sure I could find something else    And guess what  I did  I got the mango with warm sticky rice and banana ice cream  The HK waffle he said will take   minutes and I said No problem because I can eat my first   scoops first  The mango was phenomenal    And by the time I was done the waffle was ready with fresh mint and Nocciola I c    Out of the   flavors  my favorite was the mango  Kinda reminds me of HK mango ic  So while I m there I noticed the cookies and the choux they had  I asked if i can just have the Nutella choux since I already have   scoops of IC  They said no and it was sold only with ice cream in it  At the time I thought   scoops is quite enough for me    All night I kept thinking of the Nutella choux and decided to go the next day before my flight tho it was cutting it close  I m so happy to say that I Got the Nutella choux with mango IC    And I made my flight  Phew     All in all it s totally worth it  Good quality ice cream  Nice variety of flavors  Will definitely come back for the ice cream  Oh yeah there s always a line     Highly recommended  ,5,2018-09-02
You had me at ice cream      cookies   What better way to eat ice cream than on a cookie   Love the idea of choosing your flavor of cookie and ice cream   I did a half sandwich with   different flavor   Ginger cookie with cinnamon toast and burnt toffee  get this flavor it is the best    Definitely best to be eating with a spoon but if you are brave go ahead and it it like a sandwich   I liked dipping scooping the ice cream with the cookie  If going with a friend I suggest u split your cookies in half so you can get a different cookie on each end ,5,2019-08-09
Like everyone else I hate lineups  so luckily I came here when it was raining and gloomy outside  There was still quite a number of people  but the line was about   minutes   The ice cream flavours are unique  and although they re known for their ice cream sandwiches  it s just too messy for my liking   so I got a single scoop and a cookie separately  I tried the avocado ice cream   which tastes a lot like avocado milkshakes at Vietnamese restaurants  and the rococo cookie  The cookie was surprisingly crumbly  delicate and not too sweet    Great option for vegans  I think they have   or   vegan flavours   Would definitely come back  but I wouldn t wait in a long line  I mean the ice cream is good  but not worth a     minute wait imo  Moving on ,4,2015-06-29
There s so much hype about this place I ve finally decided to try it out  I was told their London fog ice cream is a must try but when I got there they were all out   Instead my friend and I got their espresso ice cream with macaron and fresh mint with oreo ice cream with the nutella puff   The ice creams were very smooth and flavorful  we loved them  Nutella puff was very chocolatey and yummy   The macaron was a bit hard though  couldn t really bite through it and we had to throw half of that away   Overall the experience was good and would definitely come back to try their other flavors and the Hong Kong egg waffles as well ,4,2014-09-18
It changed my life  My standards of ice cream are higher now  Way higher  My wife got the half peanut butter and jelly ice cream sammy with everything cookie  I got the whole sammy with everything cookie  and rocky road kill ice cream  If you are in Toronto you have to go here  It is worth the wait in line and I don t like waiting in lines  My wife says I should give this place    stars because she loved it and that s all she has to say ,5,2016-05-15
Like you  who s reading this review debating about whether Bang Bang is worth the legendary hour wait  I too have heard abuot this place a year ago but never made my way down to Ossington until now   Nah  my sweet tooth didn t snap   After having dinner at a resto right across from Bang Bang  I had no excuse to not brave the line and finally try what I presumed to be overhyped icecream sandwiches   Sorry Bang Bang  but you were definitely overhyped   Fortunately we only waited for   min or so  on a breezy Friday night so it was definitely not bad at all   The ice cream sandwiches   I mean  it s really just two cookies sandwiching some well made ice cream   Their flavour selection is huge  see photo   and so   we tried the chocolate hazelnut with the birthday cake cookie   TOO SWEET   The ice cream was      delish but the combo of these two flavours were overpoweringly sweet   Should ve opted for something bitter lighter on the ice cream   I had a try at the cherry miso ice cream too   unique and very good   You have the choice of getting a full ice cream sandwich or a half sandwich  so  one cookie split into two pieces    which we opted for  since we decided to share a HK waffle cone after   That waffle cone tasted DIVINE with the London fog ice cream   It was freshly made  worth that   min additional wait   so soft  and contrasted nicely with the ice cream sandwich that grew me another sweet tooth   Would it be worth a  h  wait   Nah   But if you re around the area and the weather is nice  chill on Ossington for a bit and give Bang Bang a shot,4,2015-05-22
The plus was there was not much of a line all three times I went   The minus is they never have the HK waffle in stock   Their ice cream is delicious but they need more sour flavors ,3,2015-08-25
Ice cream that s worth lining up for    I ve driven by this place so many times and noticed a long line up everytime I do  And I finally joined the line and let me tell you when I finally got my ice cream  it was pretty damn delicious    They have many flavours  so many to choose from so you ll definitely come back to try some more  You can also try the ice cream in cups  cones  within a cookie  or with waffles  Some many different possibilities here   I got the lychee with raspberry and rosewater  pretty unique combination  within a peanut butter cookie  Mannnn  the blend of flavours was just amazing  And the cookie was one of the best I ve ever tried  This is all coming from some one who prefers gelato over ice cream    Definitely would come back again to try different flavours and different combinations of ice cream ,5,2017-09-10
     stars  My friend and I came to get the seasonal flavours  matcha genmaicha and lychee rosewater raspberry  and it did not disappoint  The flavours were all really pronounced and strong so you could definitely taste each of the distinct flavours in the ice cream  The texture of the ice cream is also really smooth and creamy unlike ice cream that you ve had in the freezer for too long  We got it with the Hong Kong waffle and the waffle was freshly made so it was pretty hot when we got it  Personally  I don t like my ice cream to be too soft and melted  but the heat of the waffle will definitely melt the scoop of ice cream at the bottom  so that was my only complaint minus the long lineup   The waffle itself has a really nice flavour  Would definitely return to try all the other flavours and get a different cone next time ,4,2017-05-07
I happened to pass by Bang Bang Ice Cream on Ossington  and the beautiful storefront definitely caught my eye  Kudos to the designer   I wish I could say that the ice cream sandwiches lived up to the decor  I had a half sandwich of a peanut butter cookie with chocolate hazelnut ice cream  I found the cookie a bit tough  stale   and the ice cream way too gummy  Mind you  the flavour was good and they give a pretty generous portion  I also had an espresso  which was pretty good   I d try it again  but only if I really really wanted a sweet treat ,3,2014-09-14
Bang Bang Icecream is something I ve been wanting to try since it opened a couple years ago  However  I ve never been in the area where it s convenient for me to go or if I am then the line is H U G E   My boyfriend decided to end my misery and took me here on a Sunday night  raining   There was still somewhat of a lineup    people ahead  and  the store itself was packed from people waiting and eating   The line moved fairly quickly but if there were more people that ordered egg waffles  takes time to make  then you can see how long the wait times could be extended   The staff was friendly in a bright and clean interior  They have soo many novel ice creams   I got    HK Milk Tea  in a cup   This was actually made really well  I thought it would be really sweet but it wasn t  I could taste the tea through the blend of the milk which is surprising and a huge bonus     The Egg Waffle with Pistachio   Vanilla Icecream  The pistachio will be my go to when I come back next  It was so nutty and natural that I crave it when I feel like icecream  Note  The Egg Waffle does take an extra      minutes depending on if anybody else ordered it in front of you   It came to about     for everything  The location is far for me so I had to drive   parking is a huge hassle especially if you can t parallel park   I can t wait to come back during the summer ,4,2019-01-04
Be prepared to wait       minutes on Ossington for Ice Cream  The place is small and offers no seating inside  so the line naturally trails down the street  Bang Bang is easy to miss if you re driving down Ossington too fast  It s easier to spot the crowd  then the store front itself    This is a very cool little joint with quality ice cream and even cooler cones and cookie sandwich options  The artisan ice cream has unheard of infusions that you will only find here and offers a few vegan or gluten free options also  For all the latest flavours check out my pictures from tonight   The creamy and thick ice cream is either served in fresh cookies made on site  or a waffle cone that is literally a fresh made full waffle cooked in front of you  The Ice cream has different consistencies as the ingredients are different  and sometimes have chunks of cake or whatever the descriptions says  I recommend burnt toffee  cinnamon toast  or key lime pie  Be warned you ll often be in line with all the people who have been drinking in the area and who have spilled out of the local pubs  If you like ice cream and often go out of your way to get it  Bang Bang is worth the wait  I ll return once a year in the summer  when i don t mind waiting outside  If you think you should return on a quieter day  there won t be one   Enjoy the sugar high  and go to your happy place ,4,2017-04-16
Despite the line being long  this joint is definitely worth the wait   They have several different interesting cookie flavours that are all made in house  There is a choice between chewiness as well  they even have waffles and chinese  egg  pastries  Enough options for everyone  The ice cream flavours are also very unique  There are flavours such as avocado  Vietnamese coffee  and even your traditional flavours like chocolate and strawberry but it all depends on availability as they make and sell  The only negative I have for this place is the lack of eating areas  And it s important to sit and eat this scrumptious goodness as it can get messy   So be prepared for a wait and bring a moist toilette because your fingers will get dirty    Overall  great gem alongside a lot of other great eats in the ossington area  A must go for toronto desserts ,5,2015-01-12
Holy moly  so delicious  I had the PBJ ice cream and the gluten free cookie and it was a wonderful magical experience  Ribbons of rich salty peanut butter with sweet very fruit soft chunks made the sticky melty treat a delight  Totally worth the    minute wait in the sun  My biggest piece of advice is that while you wait you ll start to think that the whole sandwich would be a good idea but I can say without a doubt that it would have been too much for me   so don t let the wait get the best of you ,5,2016-05-16
This place is a bit hard to find as theres no giant sign or anything for it  I heard so many great things and as an ice cream lover  I was pretty excited to try BangBang       I shared a full ice cream sandwich which cost us     A full ice cream sandwich grants us the option of getting two ice cream flavours and also two different cookies  We got the everything cookies  nuts  chocolate  oats   the bday cake cookie  vanilla cookie with sprinkles essentially   totaro ice cream and london fog ice cream    The everything cookie is delicious  Its jam packed with a bunch of different crunchy goodies   The bday cake cookie was so chewy and soft  It really did resemble birthday cake   The totaro ice cream was sweet with a super creamy taste and texture  I could taste the purple yam flavour clearly   The london fog ice cream was amazing  It had such a unique flavour and the earl grey taste shined through    Although a bit pricy  you get a good sized portion and the employees are quite friendly ,4,2016-05-26
Very good ice cream  There are a lot of different flavors and they are very original and unique too  The ice cream sandwiches are good  There is a lot of choices of cookies  The bubble waffle cone is good too  There is often something new to try ,5,2016-10-07
I still dream about that London Fog ice cream I had last year  There are so many other amazing flavours listed   I m sure you can t go wrong with any of them   but if you crave that bergamot rich flavour perfectly enriched by and entwined in the most luxurious  thick  vanilla ice cream you can possibly imagine  then this IS your dream  scream ,5,2018-11-06
This was one of my favorite places I visited during my Toronto trip  I had the lychee ice cream in a cone  and it was fantastic  The lychee ice cream was nice and refreshing  with a perfect lychee taste that isn t too overwhelming  Only downside was that it was over    a cone for a scoop   The girlfriend also got the waffle with London Fog  earl grey tea  and Totaro  taro  ice creams  Both ice creams were fantastic  The earl grey was my favorite  It was a light  yet sweet taste  but my favorite part was the brief aroma that fills your mouth after each bite  The downside to the waffle is that the waffle comes out so warm it melts your ice cream  It was literally leaking from the bottom  Secondly  not only do you get leaky  melting ice cream  but it would put you back     The waffle is just like a waffle  but paired with the ice cream  I personally don t understand the hype  There s too much waffle breadiness to it and it overpowers my favorite part  the ice cream  And as others have mentioned in their review  there s so much waffle compared to ice cream  all you re left with in the end is waffle soaked up with melted ice cream   Also a couple other things  other than the aforementioned price and waffle issues  that led to a   instead of a   star rating  long lines and   sample only  I understand limiting samples so that the lines could go faster  but I think they should allow two samples so you know which ice cream you want to choose in comparison to another  I sampled the hazelnut but thought it was too sweet  so I gambled on the lychee and luckily I loved my choice  It would ve been more reassuring if I could have sampled both  though   I would definitely recommend this place  but in my opinion  the waffle isn t really worth it  Come for their wide variety of unique ice cream flavors ,4,2016-05-10
I seen this place on a website of places to go when I was planning my trip to Toronto  Everything looked good  They don t really offer places that specialize in ice cream sandwiches where I m from  so I knew I had to try   When we first walked up to the place I noticed that the line was super long  Which normally means that what they offer is pretty good  so that was good sign  The line didn t take that long to move so it wasn t that bad either    I ended up getting Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream between a Cinnamon Roll  It was really good  The Ice Cream had nice flavor and the Cinnamon roll was warm and nice  I loved every second that I was eating it  I wish I could come here and try more flavors and combinations because it looked like they have some pretty interesting flavors    I would def come again when in Toronto  It s very nice experience on a warm or hot day  I d recommend this place to anyone looking for a sweet treat  Everything was nice and to the point  Can t say anything negative about this place ,5,2018-09-18
How can a place manage to go downhill so fast  I think Bang Bang got a bit too big too soon  The line is unbearably long   a    minute wait on a random weeknight  The staff are extremely slow and there is no real process  Some of the staff were also downright unfriendly and seemed annoyed to answer questions  Oh and on this regular  average night  they  ran out of spoons    I also had a friend recently try a flavour that she was told had no nuts in it  she has a nut allergy     and then after tasting it  the employee returned and said she was wrong and that particular flavour did indeed have nuts in it  Ummm    kind of a big mistake to make  Sorry Bang Bang  but you ve lost me  just as quickly as you had won me over ,2,2014-09-04
Bang bang there goes your heart  into cardiac arrest from the overconsumption of sugar   If you follow any Toronto food instagrams  you ve probably seen the ice cream treats from here  They have Hong Kong egg waffles  cookies  pastry puffs  and now cinnamon buns as ice cream vessels  The waffles are made to order  so be patient if you re ordering this  I personally prefer the cinnamon bun to the waffles and cookies  but the icing on the bun makes the ice cream combo a little too sweet  As for the ice cream  they have an abundance of flavours  The vegan chocolate sorbet is rich and smooth  but my go to flavours are totaro  coconut taro  and avocado  You can also sample when you re there but I believe they limit the samples when during peak hours    Definitely a great spot to visit after dinner  There s a ton of fantastic restaurants nearby  Or better yet  come at an off hour to avoid lining up ,4,2017-06-04
The line up is worth the wait  So many delicious options  A summer is not complete without stopping by  There are gluten free and vegan options as well    Highly recommend it guys   And I have  ,5,2017-10-01
The wait is about       mins when they re busy but damn  is it worth it  It takes about   minutes longer to get the Chinese waffle when they re busy  so expect to wait  but again  it s worth it  Favourite Flavours  Banana Pudding   Cinnamon Toast ,5,2016-07-22
Tiny shop with a HUGE line   There isn t even a sign on the top of the store to advertise what it is   We had many people passing by while we were in line asking what we were lining up for   I joked with my husband    years ago on a Friday night we d be in a line like this for a club   now for ice cream sandwiches   We went on a Friday night after watching a show at Lower Ossington theatre   Lined up   hour for our treats   The service was really really slow   It didn t help that everyone was asking to try every single flavour of ice cream before they decided   The line moved much faster at Bakerbots   We got a full sandwich of raspberry and fresh mint ice cream between chocolate cookies and a full sandwich of lemon meringue and fresh mint ice cream between a ginger cookie   Fresh mint wasn t what I was expecting   It wasn t much different than a tub of mint chip ice cream from a grocery store  I guess we should have tried it before we ordered it but felt bad for holding the line since we were so annoyed with the people in front of us doing it    The raspberry and lemon flavours however were delicious   We were also limited with our ice cream flavours by the time we made it to the front of the line at      pm   half hour before close   Bang Bang also had other options to sandwich your ice cream between other things like a French macaron  a puff pastry or use a HK waffle as a cone that is not offered at Bakerbots     Overall the ice cream sandwiches were great but I wouldn t line up an hour for it again   We d go to Bakerbots for the    min wait or wait for the hype to die down here ,4,2014-07-26
There is always a huge line up when I come to Bang Bang but it feels like such a sin to be in the area and not indulge  The most common menu item is the HK style waffles  HK style waffles are pretty much waffles that are shaped into little battered ovals linked together  They are super yummy and easy to eat because they pull apart  I like the burnt toffee ice cream with it the best  I ve also tried the macaroons and the cookie with ice cream as well but I would say that burnt toffee ice cream with HK style waffle is still my favorite ,5,2014-10-03
Freshly baked cookies  bubble waffles  and other heavenly goods to hold hand made amazing ice cream  Inventive flavors  unbelievable smell  the place is a grown up s mini version of the Wonka factory which explains the line ups out the door and down the street most nights  Doesn t get better than this in ice cream in Toronto  Makes feeling guilty feel good every time   ,5,2017-12-16
Bang Bang Ice Cream is the only place on my non existing list that I wanted to check out while I was in town  I tried coming here two years ago when they were randomly closed for holidays  It s located right next door to B ehmer   We dropped in on a Tuesday evening  around     pm  and just missed the late night rush  We only had to wait about    minutes to get in  The line doubled in size when we got out   The inside is small but the staff are quick and efficient  There s a small menu with prices  to the right on the wall   scoops  get stuffed  hot and cold drinks  It s a bit odd that they don t have the prices up anywhere else    There were    flavours available along with   types of cookies  puffs  waffles and cinnybuns  Lots of unique flavours including  totaro  purple yam and coconut   mango puddin   soursop and ginger milk    I would have loved to try their Bang Bang waffle but it s a    minute wait  They need to invest in more than two waffle makers     Caramel corn on the cone and avocado        double scoop    the caramel corn wasn t what I was originally expecting but it was decent  There were pieces of caramel popcorn inside  The avocado lived up to my lofty avocado expectations  Creamy and so so good     Full ice cream sandwich           half of M s ice cream sandwich was totaro with a bday cookie  The other half was pb n  chocolate with a gingerrrrr cookie  I m not a huge fan of ice cream sandwiches with cookies but even I admit it was bomb  Totaro was dreamy but be prepared for the pb n  chocolate to be very peanut dominant     Warm cinniebun sammie           a cinnamon bun with your choice of one flavour  S went with the pb n  chocolate  Cinnamon bun was fresh  sweet and had a satisfying fluffy texture   The massive line tells it all  Bang Bang was awesome  I already want to go back to try more flavours ,5,2018-08-25
Not worth the hype  Cookies are okay  Ice cream flavours are a bit out there,3,2016-12-10
Been here a bunch and am still in love with all their flavours  I always fault to their London Fog  but this time tried their Lychee Raspberry as well  The London Fog is definitely such a classic  but the Lychee Raspberry was incredibly refreshing on a hot day   I ve tried both the ice cream sandwich  and the ice cream in an egg waffle cone  Honestly any way you get the ice cream is good ,5,2018-08-09
Shoot me dead why don t you  Bang Bang  Death by ice cream is something I wouldn t mind written on my epitaph  Too dark  Well too bad cause we re gonna talk about the     dark chocolate ice cream  Or black tea  Or toasted marshmallow  Or matcha  Or classic Vanilla  The list is endless so pick what you want and live a little with a double scoop  Or reach next level reality by going for ice cream sandwiched between two perfectly baked cookies of your choice  A diabetic nightmare you ll never want to wake up from  Expect a line  You ll be glad for the extra time to make a decision  Betchya really can t pick just one ,5,2015-10-07
Bang Bang is a really cute shop  Be prepared to wait in line before you get your delicious ice cream cookie sandwich    I had a mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich between two chocolate chip cookies  Very refreshing on a hot summer day    This is a good date place to grab a sweet treat and walk around the Ossington area  It is not a sit down dessert place    Gave it   stars because I find the whole concept of ordering an ice cream cookie sandwich for over    a bit ridiculous anywhere  but Bang Bang has great variety and fresh cookies  Also the staff are super friendly and will help you decide on the best combo for you because they have a good variety of cookie and ice cream flavours    I haven t tried their other pasties but they look delicious ,4,2018-08-29
Huge selection of flavors and decent icecream but service is ultra slow  The lineup is definitely a causation of the service speed  not just popularity  Also the  HK  waffle is NOT authentic and is not crisp and soft on the inside like it out to be  and turns out more dense and cakey as they don t really make it the proper way   They pour way too much batter in  and tons drip out in excess  The proper way is to use less batter  swirl it around for a few seconds  and flip  Trust me    I ve made hundreds of these      Overall a tiny bit overhyped but solid place to get some icecream  If you like the waffle  great  just know its not  authentic  as advertised as an HK waffle  Its just a waffle with that shape ,3,2015-05-21
My go to place for ice cream when I m in the area  Their flavors are to die for   their Rocky Road is my personal fave  There are also taro  London fog  lychee  avocado  matcha  and other unique flavors combined with more  Not to mention their Hong Kong style waffles   they re one of the good ones I ve had   To line up on a nice summer evening is torture  But it s worth the wait   only it doesn t take long for me to inhale the delicious dessert  I will always go again and again    unless their line stretches up to the whole block then maybe I ll come again another day  Even on a cold winter day  I will have it ,5,2019-05-01
A bit expensive but the flavors are amazing  I loved the london fog flavor and the totoro  ube and coconut i think     I wouldn t bother getting the egg waffles or cookies  it s not worth the price   the star of the show is the ice cream    tip  don t plan to sit down and enjoy your ice cream  there s really no space  especially when the line ups start forming ,4,2018-08-29
I am in LOVE  I got the burnt toffee icecream sandwich with the everything cookie  and let me tell you  it was well worth the    minute ish wait  The toffee pieces in the icecream were perfect  it all went so well together  Service was quick and the staff there are super nice       will come back again ,5,2019-07-21
Love the unique flavors here  We went on a Sunday afternoon and there was no line up  I ordered the London fog which is a early grey flavor  It had a light taste of Earl grey with the flowery note and wasn t too sweet  My friends tried the espresso flavor and peanut butter chocolate  The espresso was really good even though I don t like coffee  The peanut butter chocolate was okay since I m not into peanut butter  I ve also tried the matcha which tasted like green tea ice cream at most Japanese restaurants  I d definitely go back to try the more unique flavors ,4,2018-04-02
This place is amazing  I went with my boyfriend last week  We each got a waffle cone and two scoops  We also each got the orange cardamom  his second scoop was the cinnamon toast and mine was the to taro   Soooooo delicious  Their flavours are  bang on    ha perhaps it was their name   bang  bang  that prompted each of us to get two scoops    I recommend going in the day time when they re first opened  That way you get to sample more than one flavour  It s more beneficial that way  Otherwise  expect to wait in line    to    minutes  depending on the length of the line  and likely another    minutes if you decide on the waffle cone  They re busiest times are  pm to close    I saw as the young lady working the waffle cone station  took my waffle off the iron  it stayed on a little longer than ideal  As her peeling it off  caused loss of two of the bubbles  see waffle cone style in pic for reference  or divets  whatever those tiny little sectionals are called on waffles  It was also a lot crispier than my partner s  Mind you this didn t cause a loss of flavour for the cone itself  It was simply a little less enjoyable    Aside from that and the hefty price of    bucks for two double  oz scoops  equating  oz each  Everything was up to par on quality   I understand the price for homemade gourmet ice cream is larger than for standard commercial grade  However  it did seem rather steep  It s also about the experience right   Their product is similar to that of baker bots  I do not know if they are affiliated with one another    In any case  there is always room for improvement  so   out of   stars    Their staff   out of   Their product   out of   Their space   out of    It s clearly not so accommodating to large numbers  Their ambiance   out of    who doesn t like the smell of fresh waffles and baked goods  Return rating   out of    Definitely gotta try more flavours  I hear that PB and J is totally worth it ,4,2017-09-17
Was it worth the wait  Of course  The line was out the door and down the block  but moved quite fast  I visited on a cold  windy Friday night  A perfect night for ice cream if you ask me    The store itself is very small and has no indoor or outdoor seating  People pretty much order and eat their treats outside or as they walk away    They offer over    flavors and you can get it served in a cup  cone  between two cookies as a Sammie  sandwich   or in a puffy waffle cone which is made fresh to order    The staff is really friendly and efficient  They let you sample the flavors you re interested in and it makes it easier to make your selection    I got the Cinnamon Toast ice cream in a Ginger Cookie sammie half  and it was big enough to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings    My group also got the Flin Flan in the Everything Cookie  Golden Oreo in a Birthday Cookie  and Fresh Mint in the Everything cookie ,5,2019-04-14
This ice cream store has such a wide range of flavors to choose from that I was very overwhelmed when I first arrived  I love that they allow you to choose    flavors even if you just want half a cookie sandwich  I ended up getting the London Fog  earl grey tea  and dark chocolate with a captain p nut cookie  I really enjoyed this combination of flavors  The textures were perfect together  I highly recommend the captain p nut cookie if you are a fan of peanut butter  Be aware that there is no seating so you must get your ice cream to go ,4,2019-05-13
All the stars  Maybe not worth a huge wait unless the weather is nice  but they have loads of tasty treats  Really a neat place ,5,2017-07-09
Bang Bang has some really great and unique ice cream flavors   and it s clear that the community feels the same way  Imagine on a cold September night  a line of people waiting to get their hands on Bang Bang Ice Cream   you know it has to be great in that case   I had the HK Bubble Waffle with a scoop of the Oh My Gourd  pumpkin spice   and Cinnamon toast  The OMG was definitely the highlight and reminded me a lot of pumpkin pie  Would definitely order a pint if was back in the neighborhood again  The HK Bubble Waffle was also made fresh and was the perfect mix between crisp and soft    To top it off  the customer service was great   they keep the line moving to ensure that the line goes through pretty fast ,4,2018-09-30
I FINALLYYYYY tried Bang Bang on Saturday and have been dreaming about it ever since  Oh my god    My boyfriend and I shared the everything cookie with burnt toffee banana puddin  ice cream  It was amazing beyond belief  I could eat that everyday if my body allowed it  P The line was semi long but supposedly it gets longer  It wasn t the hottest day in the world so I can imagine how long it gets but regardless of the length it is worth the wait     The staff are also super friendly and will let you sample  just don t be that person that tries everything and holds up the line   The sweet treats are made super quickly and given to you right away  Good luck finding a spot on Ossington to sit and enjoy it but no matter where you are it s amazing and oh my goodness if I talk about it any longer my stomach is going to start growling  Already planning my next trip  Thanks for the best cheat treat ever Bang Bang   See you soon    ,5,2017-08-28
Ok so I m wary of ice cream because of the whole recent ice cream trend  I m even MORE wary of hyped up ice cream places  We were visiting from out of town and some people in the group wanted to try it out so I went along  I was originally not even going to get anything because I mean  I ve tried A LOT of ice cream  there are like             in CA alone   The line wasn t too long so when we came to the counter I decided to try one of their most famous flavors  totaro in an ice cream sandwich  Ok  so the cookies were pretty good already but the totaro    OH  MY  and I don t even like taro  I NEVER order it anywhere else  I have to say I was SUPER impressed with this flavor and would now happily go back to get more the next time I m in TO ,5,2018-01-17
If you ve never eaten ice cream before in your life and you re near Queen and Ossington  this place is a must try  For real  they sell ice cream  That s why there s a huge lineup outside  They re selling ice cream and people are finding out about it  The only catch is that you have to wait    to    minutes to get it because it takes a really long time to scoop ice cream  But once you do you re like   fuck yeah  I knew it  It s ice cream  ,2,2015-09-05
Line up was simply way too long  After about    mins  we didn t even move more than a property line  We have up ,1,2015-07-03
Came here after reading many  many good reviews and people raving about it    Well  Bang Bang was definitely over hyped  I was expecting more but was very underwhelmed  It wasn t too warm outside  rather very windy  By the time I paid for my half cookie sandwich  the icecream was already melting  at a rather quick speed  and created a pool underneath  It was impossible to hold it and eat it  so I ended up  dipping  my cookie into the melted icecream   Nothing special  though the cookie was moderately chewy and not too sweet  Icecream was sub par  Service was  meh   the people working at the front kind of ignored my group as we were trying to figure the menu out  Upon check out  the guy was rather rude to me  I won t be back  I d rather eat grocery store bought  cookie icecream sandwiches  ,3,2015-06-19
I cannot fathom why people line up around the block for this place when Sweet Olenka s is just around the corner  Much better product  and I ve never been in line for more than a minute or two  I just don t understand the hype ,2,2015-08-29
The ice cream is great with really good unusual flavors   The cookies are great as well   what more can you ask for    awesome ice cream on a great cookie ,5,2017-07-06
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery has always been one of my favourite ice cream places in Toronto  not only because of the wide selection of flavours that they have  but the uniqueness of them as well  It s a little out of the way from the core downtown Toronto  Yonge Dundas   but the trip is well worth it  Here s my rundown   Food  Big Bang Waffle   I always get this which combines my love for the bubble waffles and their ice cream flavours  With this  you get two  oz scoops of ice cream and have the option of choosing up to   flavours  I got it with the Totaro  ube  purple potato  and the Boba papa milk tea  ceylon   HK milk tea  and also added the    cents for the tapioca addition  Hands down the Totaro is my favourite flavour  There s a lot of flavours to choose from and you re allowed to sample them before buying which is great   Full Ice Cream Sandwich   This is cool because Bang Bang takes their baked cookies and sandwiches them between their ice cream  We got the full ice cream sandwich with the birthday cake cookie and the double chocolate cookie  The ice cream flavours we got were the same ones as the Big Bang Waffle  Comparing the two  the sandwich is for those who prefer their desserts sweeter while the waffle is for those dessert lovers who are looking for a toned down version of sweetness    Atmosphere   Not much to say about this as there isn t really an option to dine in here  You buy your dessert and then either loiter around the place and enjoy your snack or walk and eat  It s a bummer that the space isn t too big but it s like finding a diamond in the rough as the quality of the desserts makes up for the lack of space   Service   Service was great and the employees were quite informative  They were very friendly and answered our questions well when we were very indecisive with the flavours that we wanted    Price   The Big Bang Waffle was       and the Full Ice Cream Sandwich was        There was also the option of getting a half ice cream sandwich as well which is         Verdict   HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place for desserts  There s enough flavours here to appeal to the masses and the food is always great quality here  Even the cookies have standards too  if they ever have subpar cookies  slightly overbaked   they sell them for a cheaper price than their regular cookies   It s a long walk from downtown but well worth it for the quality of food and the extra burned calories you re getting from walking that distance  or bussing  from the downtown core ,5,2018-08-18
Try not to walk past this newly opened store  It doesn t have an overhead store sign yet and only has a poster saying Bang Bang in the store window s bottom corner  but it is a definitely must visit spot for summer       Bang Bang is one of Bakerbot s sister stores and sells the same ice cream and cookies  I love how you can try out different flavours before you decide to commit and  choose one for the cookie ice cream sandwich  While the burnt toffee was too bitter in my opinion  the lemon meringue and raspberry flavours are absolutely delicious   Also the cost of desserts here is slightly more expensive than the Bakerbots located near Ossington station  A half ice cream cookie sandwich here is       while it is only    at Bakerbots  This is only a slight difference and probably has to do with the difference in cost of rent ,4,2014-06-08
the ice cream were very good and the waffles were so yummy and you can even smell the butter,4,2016-05-03
The campfire toasted marshmallow ice cream with the Nutella puff was phenomenal  The ice cream captured the marshmallow flavour perfectly  Plus the chocolate in the puff    Wow it s like you re at the cottage in front of a bonfire    Also tried the London fog in a waffle cone  Pretty good  But not as awesome ,5,2017-09-07
Great variety of ice cream flavours  The Chinese style waffle cone is a treat  but expect a wait  The line up was down the street on an October evening with about a    minute wait ,4,2016-01-10
The best best cookie I ve had  I had the burnt toffee ice cream which was great  Would love to go here again soon ,5,2018-07-23
lined up    minutes on a late sat night    totally worth it    I picked everything cookie   black tea ice cream   burnt toffee ice cream    WOW  Love it first bite   ice cream is smooth and rich in flavor  esp the black tea one  The burnt toffee is more on a sweet side   would definitely go back to try out more flavors ,5,2014-09-08
I m giving this place   stars purely for its ice cream flavours  They have some of the best ice cream flavours I ve ever tasted and also have very unique flavours  I ve had Love Oolong Time  Burnt Toffee and The Bee s Knees  chamomile   salted honey   Love Oolong Time was delicious with a very strong tea flavour and the Burnt Toffee was delightfully sweet with melted toffee and toffee bits swirled into the ice cream  I thought the Bee s Knees was a bit flavourless in comparison to the other two  but my friend who loves honey liked it    While I typically love egg waffles  I thought the ice cream was better without the waffle  It was difficult to eat without getting ice cream on your hands and I ve had better egg waffles elsewhere   Overall  I would      recommend this place for their ice cream  Definitely worth waiting in line for ,5,2016-06-19
Ironically went there during the fall winter season as the line ups tend to trail down the street of Ossington ,4,2015-11-11
Ordered taro ice cream sammies with dark chocolate cookies  It was worth the    minutes  wait   ,4,2019-07-09
 Bang Bang   You ve got me  agh  During these humid and torird summer days  I m hallucinating and searching for ways to cool off  My search was no longer during my last day in Toronto  Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery has been opened for   years and they are cranking out unique and flavorful treats    I have never imagined miso being in ice cream  so when I tried the Miso Mon Cheri  I was initially confused  but quickly appreciated the idea that ice cream could taste savory as well  I also ordered a small side of the Totaro  Ube  based on their puff cookies  It was amazing and perfect what I needed    With over    flavors and   vegan flavors  I am not surprised why this is a popular place to visit  The shop is small and there usually is a line so my advice is to head over when they open  I believe I came over around  pm  but check their hours  Other tip  you can only sample   flavor  I m glad that rule is in place as I would be here all day eating everything    Kudos to these chefs back here who are experimenting and perfecting these awesome flavors  Wishing they could open other locations on the West Coast ,5,2019-07-24
I m from California so trendy dessert shops are everywhere  so I have a very high standard for places that are going for that same decor since they are trying to attract that same demographic   There are a lot of places that try but fail miserably because the quality of the product was lackluster  Sometimes places don t even try so hard on their decor  but their product is absolutely out of the world  Bang Bang is has a great balance of both    I ordered the London Fog Ice Cream sandwich with the Everything cookie and the Oatmeal cookie  It was a LOT  They have smaller ice cream options  but I was only in town for a few days so I wanted to go ALL out  The earl grey flavor was present as the ice cream wasn t overly sweet  You don t feel like you ve been punched with such a strong tea or punched with so much sugar   But my favorite were the cookies  the Everything cookie reminded me of the Compost cookie from Momofuku Milk Bar and the Oatmeal was their new twist on a classic  I would go back  probably not get a cookie sandwich unless I m really hungry  I would probably order a scoop of ice cream and a couple cookies on the side to snack on later throughout the day  Also  remember to be ready for the prices  Trendy ain t cheap ,4,2017-11-14
This place was fine  ice cream was fine  not worth all the hype or the long line up we were all left feeling very underwhelmed given the way this place is talked about so much ,3,2015-11-13
Went to Bang Bang twice in    hours  So good  Gluten free and vegan options    My one complaint  I was charged for a vegan ice cream sandwich tonight when I got the vegan cookie and regular ice cream ,5,2015-08-03
Visiting Toronto and this ice cream shop was on my list of things to try  I went this evening and waited for about    min  The Bees Knees  chamomile tea infused with honey  and London Fog paired well in the HK waffle cone  It was a truly delicious special treat  though pricey in my opinion at    Canadian  I highly recommend the Bees Knees if you like chamomile  the flavor is really awesome and unusual  I was disappointed that there was really no place to sit down to enjoy the    ice cream and waffle  and I had to eat it on the go ,4,2017-08-03
Really interesting flavor combinations  some of which were a little too funky for me  Expect a long line up pretty much any time of the day  Roughly       minutes wait   I find that some times the staff can be slow even with the large line but it tends to be worth it ,4,2016-05-29
I have to say  when I drove past it and saw the long line  I was very hesitant on parking the car  But  the wife wanted it and was willing to wait  so off to park the car I go   This place serves the BEST rocky road ice cream EVER      Completely worth the wait  well  she waited and I watched the babies   It had large chunks of nuts  tons of marshmallows  and the chocolate was rich and delicious  I ordered it in the Hong Kong egg puff waffle  SO GOOD   Just come and wait  it s so worth it,4,2017-04-28
I know it looks like a crazy line  But I promise you  it s worth it  Love all the combo of flavors   and we ve had quite a few  the London fog  the genimacha  sp   tiramisu  the banana pudding  the Lychee rose water raspberry  Particularly one of my favorite  very crunchy bang bang waffle cone or egg waffle cone  Very good batter such that it doesn t get too soggy even when we got to the end of the cone  We ve came all hours of the evening  weekdays and weekends  The line is usually shorter earlier in the night ,5,2017-07-27
With family in Toronto  I had this place on my list for a few months before I finally made it  The one con is the fact that we waited in line for    minutes but that also goes to show how good the treats are at Bang Bang  I got a delicious cookie sandwich with the Rococoa cookie on one side and the everything cookie  chocolate  pretzels  peanut butter  and oatmeal  on the other  Love the variety of cookie options but wish I didn t have to feel bad holding up the line when asking to try ice cream flavors  Definitely will try to make it back next time I am in Toronto   will make a point to try to go during an off hour to avoid the lines ,4,2017-09-30
Those cookies are to die for        if you just want a cookie  But you might as well go for the sammies  You re looking to spend about    for a half sammie  I initially didn t like some of the ice creams but I ve changed my mind this past year  All you have to do is find the right one for you  For me  that s the key lime pie with everything cookie  Hits the spot everytime  So refreshing and if you like  its gluten free ,4,2015-07-14
Finally I was able to get into this place with only one person ahead of me  thinking that I would be served within a reasonable amount of time  I can t begin to tell you how wrong I was  This is still that place that pays people to stand around and talk about everything under the sun while a giant line forms to create fake buzz and hype  Let me be clear  the hype isn t real  it s manufactured by slow prep cooks and incompetent staff  who only work on one item at a time  even when there are   waffle irons cleaned and ready to use  I waited    min just for my item with only one person ahead of me    Aside from the serious problems  the food is great  the waffle cone is chewier than regular hk style cones  but the lychee ice cream really did it for me  My coworker wanted me to get catering from this place  so I ve been trying to sample it for a while  at this stage it s not worth the time or frustration  I love supporting small businesses in the GTA  and a business is  only as good as its people  Two stars for good food  and some innovative flavors  lost two stars for slow service  no seating and terrible staffing ,2,2015-10-07
Ice cream was so good cinnamon toast    I had the ice cream sandwich and you get to mix cookies for it which I thought was pretty good but I will be visiting again soon,5,2017-09-19
Bang bang  into my heart you ice cream fiend  I think I found Toronto s baddest ice cream shop and am reviewing it for my     th review on Yelp   This popular ice cream joint was made for the ice cream connoisseur  The moment you walk in  you are greeted with so many options that are made weekly to serve  From London Fog to even boba  there were some really unique flavors that you could sample  I was a huge fan of their mango sticky rice which used actual rice in their ice cream  The small grain made such a difference in texture and taste   Once you ve chosen your ice cream s   you choose how you want it presented whether as an ice cream cookie sandwich  a waffle cone  or just in a cup  Altogether  you can really modify and change how you enjoy this delectable dessert  Each cup ends up being about    so it s on the steeper side but the quality makes up for the price   The ice cream here at Bang Bang was on point  So smooth  creamy  and worth the wait you may endure   Overall service was good but I did feel some pressure in selecting my ice cream and cone choice  There was no line when we first arrived but shortly after  it picked up  Before I even got a chance to try all the flavors I wanted  I felt the side eye from the server and quickly chose and left ,4,2019-07-07
This place is really awesome    Super pretty in the inside and amazing verity of flavours so  your bound to find something you like  Plus they show what s inside each flavour  I can t have alcohol or gelatine so it s nice to see what I can have without asking  So  far I ve had coconut mango  banana pudding  fresh mint and what the fudge all really delicious  My favourite is coconut mango and I highly recommend it ,5,2018-04-20
MY FAVOURITE ice cream place in Toronto  The waits in the summer and fall time are no joke  but come here after a nice dinner and wait in line to burn off those dinner calories      Their flavour combos are so unique  but also yummy and it s good on its own  in a waffle cone  normal cone  or in between cookies   My personal favourites are rosewater lychee  good humour me  coconut mango puddin  and boba papa milk tea   Pro tip  always get   flavours and if you really like one that s available in the pint size  take that to go for home,5,2019-08-29
I tasted the orange cardamom and it had a very refreshing  bright summer kind of flavor  I decided to go with the Burnt Toffee on the Chocolate Cookie  The Burnt Toffee was INCREDIBLE   The pieces of burnt toffee were airy and crunchy  Nothing that will break your teeth  Not sure how they are made but they should package them for retail sale  I would definitely buy those crunchy toffee bites   This was a great find   I m glad I ordered the     cookie because it was plenty big ,5,2019-04-13
At this point Bang Bang is an Ossington Village institution  The sheer variety of ice creams and baked goods  as vehicles for said ice cream  is mind blowing  Living nearby  we visit quite regularly and everything is consistently delicious   Pro tip    if you want to avoid a particularly long line  they can be brutal   you can hop right in and pick out pre made ice cream sandwiches in their fridge   Don t think twice about this place  it s sure to be a crowd pleaser ,5,2019-04-20
There were a great assortment of icecreams with such creative names too   and cookies to choose from  My date got two scoops of lychee with raspberry curd and rosewater icecream with the egg waffle  I got two scoops of avocado icecream and egg waffle  They were delicious  Only downside is the line up was fairly long and there s no where to sit  Will definitely will be coming back in the future to explore other flavours ,5,2016-04-28
Top notch dessert fare   Tons of options including cones  cookies  donuts  and HK waffles to accompany the many flavours of ice cream    Unfortunately the line is always out the door and down the sidewalk  Not worth a    minute wait if you ask me  Would give   stars otherwise    If you happen to stop by when it s not busy  it s a must try ,3,2017-07-14
  star with a caveat        stars with the crazy wait  I got lucky and came on a Thursday evening for only a    minute wait   The wait can suck     hard   I ve seen line up go out the door and loop twice on the sidewalk   Even on a boring summer Thursday night  it did go out to the sidewalk for a bit and I still waited   minutes to order and another    minutes for the waffle cone   Is it worth    minutes    barely   One thing they do smartly is limit the amount of flavour trials cause the line up is already crazy     A few things are great about this place    there are a lot of great choices that are unique to Toronto and they have a rotation of good seasonal flavours   I also like how they have many interesting ways to hold the ice cream   You have their instagram famous HK egg waffle cone  a variety of cookies  cinnamon bun  sugar cone  regular cone  cup  and pate a choux  aka their puffs      As for service  it does move as fast as it can    they have at least   people scooping and making the fresh to order HK egg waffles and   person dedicated to the cashier   So it s not like they re slacking   What s a millennial to do      Try to get the black carbon soft serve     oh wait that s a crazy wait too    So we ordered   HK egg waffles filled with   scoops each    one was their seasonal Ontario strawberry  such a sucker for Ontario fruit  with Totaro  taro with coconut  and also cinnamon toast   One thing I noticed is that Bang Bang is generous with their ice cream sandwich scoops   And with the many different cookies they have  you have a lot of flavour combinations   Egg Waffle   This is what brought us here and I think with the lighter line up  we didn t have the same issues of other reviewers   Oh dont get me wrong  the wait was borderline crazy but not the     minutes some others mentioned   We only had   cones before us being made   The problem is that they have only   irons and the moment you get   people wanting the waffle cones  you have easily a     min wait on top of the order wait   So people said theirs were hollow or too dry   Ours actually was decently done   It was crisp on the edges but the bubbles had a softer centre and filled completely so it was a nice waffle         Totaro ice cream   a medium purple taro ice cream with coconut bits embedded into it   This is a light flavour and for those who are expecting more of a coconut note  you might be disappointed   It isn t sugary sweet but it also wasn t as strong as the ones I ve had in Asia   Still a decent one considering it wasn t a complete sugar overload and electric purple        Ontario Strawberry   Oh you can see the pieces of strawberries and seeds in it   This was very enjoyable    definitely cream and vibrant light strawberry flavour   Compared to the Ontario Strawberry at Sweet Olenka s  I think Bang Bang is a bit better with a stronger flavour   It is creamy with no icy notes  I know Sweet Olenka s is vegan    Compared to Roselle items  this could have a stronger strawberry flavour          Cinnamon Toast   This was an interesting flavour because at first bite  it s just a sweet cream and then at the very end the cinnamon hits you   It is definitely a stronger flavour compared to the Ontario Strawberry and Totaro Ice Cream   It s very creamy and well done        Comparing Bang Bang to Eva s for best instagrammable cone  I would say Bang Bang has the edge because the ice cream is good compared to the regular vanilla soft serve of Eva s and I liked the egg waffle better   I had a tiny wait compared to the craziness of Saturday  where I ve heard an hour wait  so if the line up is that nutty  I wouldn t think it s a   star   Kekou gelato still has the crown for the best ice cream gelato though ,4,2017-07-07
Totaro ice cream on a waffle cone  So delicious  I waited right when it opened to avoid the summer line ups  Delicious  Probably my favorite ice cream in the city  They also have the cookie sandwiches and the Hong Kong style waffle cones if you ve got a bigger appetite    We also got thank you very matcha  vegan chocolate  and the lychee raspberry with Rosewater  All were super good too  Totaro is just my favorite ,5,2016-09-15
Went to bang bang for the first time on August   th around  hour before closing time  Paid for parking and lined up for about    minutes  The ice cream was worth the wait  but the service was appalling   My friend and I each placed an order and we paid separately  The order came in about     mins for my friend  while I continued to wait for my waffle and ice cream   When the couple behind me received their order of waffle and ice cream  I realized bang bang might have lost my order   I approached the cashier to ask how long the wait was going to be  and she confirmed that our order was nowhere to be seen  The staff kept asking us if we remembered which cashier took our order and was very unapologetic  Several staff crowded around the cashier to ask us who took our order and none of them offered an apology for losing our order  Instead  the cashier gave us   choices  more like an ultimatum      We can refund you your money or    You can have the next order  She had no smile on her face and clearly didn t care that we had just spent money on parking and waited in line for an hour and didn t value our patronage    Throughout this entire ordeal  their staff had no smiles and offered zero apologies  Bang bang ice cream might be good but that doesn t give them the right to be impolite to customers and treat them like dirt   I realize that their Staff could be really tired and stressed out after a long and busy day but management should address this    Anyway  I recommend their London fog ice cream and taro ,2,2016-09-03
You must check out this if you re on Ossington  as it s becoming the worst kept secret in desserts   Finally I can get a proper ice cream sandwich in my neighbourhood without going up to Bloor to Bakerbots   Every time I pass by here I see some people milling about and on Sunday  it was slightly rainy but it didn t stop people from lining up   Ordering is simple  choose your ice cream  and then choose your cookie   They didn t have any orange cardomom when I was there so I settled for the key lime pie  with an  Everything  cookie with peanut butter inside   I was splitting with a friend  and they were kind enough to serve the whole sandwich cut in half for    total instead of charging us twice for       half servings   Staff were also helpful in letting us try samples  and giving suggestions for ice cream and cookie pairings   Portions are generous  particularly with the ice cream  and if you try to bite into the sandwich ice cream oozes out everywhere  so I used the provided spoon   Cookie was amazingly flavourful with a hit of peanut butter  while the key lime pie ice cream was rich without resorting to use of tacky food colouring  so a    for a touch of class   Will make this a regular dessert spot whenever I m in the neighbourhood  which looks like will be quite often ,5,2014-06-10
This is a must if you are in the Toronto area  Lots of ice cream flavors to choose from and yummy cookies to sandwich the ice cream between  My son got the waffle with nutella inside   delicious  There was a bit of a wait  but the kids said it was worth it  Portions are big   the full cookie sandwich was enough for   ,5,2019-06-20
Waited in line for about    minutes to get a waffle and ice cream  Overall  it was not worth the wait  The ice cream was fine  but the waffle was very burnt ,3,2017-09-07
We line up here even in the winter  Their mango pudding sticky rice is to die for  Will keep coming back ,5,2019-03-31
Perhaps one of the most satisfying dessert one could have or being served by many places   Fresh made Hot HongKong Egg Waffle   crispy  hot and flavourful  with FLAVOUR EXPLODING  homemade ice cream scoops  all on your hand   what can you ask for more    London fog and Totoro  taro  are the must order ice cream  Yes  they are certified delicious   But my favourite is Cinnamon Toast  Seriously  if you love Cinnamon toast that crunch sugar with deep scent  you should try it    Staff Is SUPER FRIENDLY at least when I was there ,5,2015-12-14
Heard good things about Bang Bang so thought I d try it since weather s been so nice lately   Seems like other people had the same idea as there was a small line up in front of the place  something I didn t expect on a Tuesday night     It was pretty quick though and looking on the flavour board  they have many different flavours and I liked the names  London Fog  Thank you very Matcha  etc   Very creative and fun     I opted not for the  waffle  cone as some have suggested it s a bit much and just wanted to try the ice cream without all the extras  cookies  and things   I tried the Milk and Cookies but opted for the London Fog   Taste was strong but like a strong tea or coffee   After awhile I notice how creamy it was and I m sure some people may like that but I thought it was too much   I imagine with the cookie  or waffle cone  it d be equivalent to a meal   If I wanted a meal  I d walk down to Bellwoods Brewery and have a meal     So if you had salad for dinner and not quite satisfied  Bang Bang would hit the spot   Otherwise head down to Kekou on Queen Street ,3,2016-05-11
Stood in line for    minutes for one of these bad boys  Joked that even if the ice cream was terrible  we d have to eat it down and imagine it was delicious to justify our wait  Luckily  it was delicious  Had a half ice cream cookie sandwich   scoops of key lime and chocolate hazelnut stuff between halves of an oatmeal cookie   Unlike other ice cream sandwich places  this wasn t overly sweet   actually just perfect  The tangy key lime was rich in flavour without being mouthpuckering  and the chocolate hazelnut was like a rich  cold  and smooth as butter ferrero roche  Overall  great experience  Would wait again ,5,2015-07-14
Omg  Ginger cookie with orange cardamom ice cream sandwich is to die for  I have friends that live out of the city and crave it from afar on the regular after they ve experienced Bang Bang ,5,2017-11-03
The ice cream here is very unique  Its not too sugary and there are a large variety of flavors  I got an ice cream sandwich  however  I felt that the taste of the cookie detracted and distracted from the flavor of the ice cream  If I were to come here again I would probably get it in a cone ,4,2017-11-24
lots of new flavours  they change it up all the time  ice cream is delicious    only downside  they re always superbusy in the summer especially  could easily be a wait of   hr ,3,2016-11-06
If you re looking for unique ice cream flavours  this is the place to go to  Although there are usually long lines in the summer  it s so worth it   My top   flavours is   London fog and Avocado   I always get my scopes in a waffle cone    They are open all year long  so it s never too cold for ice cream ,5,2018-12-03
Instant   stars because with only a limit of one sample  I managed to choose two delicious icecream flavours with a HK waffle  Waited all summer and finally got a chance to stop by after dinner  Wait time  approximately    minutes total with your dessert in hand  and it was worth it    Lychee raspberry and the matcha twist with jasmine blew my mind  They are faster now with waffle orders so checkout was quick and efficient  Got to try a bit of the boba papa icecream and it was good as well  Tapioca is an extra       as a topping ,5,2019-09-22
At first I thought about only giving this place four stars because of the intense wait times  We re not SF or BK  it s not terribly Toronto to wait in line for the coolest new thang  We re more likely to go drink in Bellwoods until there s not a line  or check out a mom and pop gelato shop instead  But  after waiting in line for local ice cream  I have to admit it was worth the wait   I had a Hong Kong waffle cone with London Fog and Chocolate Squared ice cream  I am not an ice cream person at all  and I was pretty obsessed  My partner has    ice cream sandwiches    JK  he had two halves  and he was incredibly into the bacon ice cream in one    Bang Bang is a great great reminder of how some places deserve the hype  Go get in line and have a billion frozen calories  friend  You can even bring a vegan or a g free pal  Just go ,5,2015-04-30
perfect end to a day of biking through Toronto  Absolutely delicious and they have a lot of cool flavors  Got my ice cream in a cinnamon bun because I need all the sugars  purple scoop is the taro  ,5,2018-01-06
My brother has been raving about this place for a few weeks now  so I figured I d stop in and give it a shot  I love ice cream  I  love  cookies  It s a no brainer  right   Wrong  The place was super crowded when I showed up at around      on a Sunday  which I took to be a good sign  After perusing their dozen or so ice cream flavors and handful of cookies  no chocolate chip    I opted for a half sandwich of pumpkin spice ice cream in a ginger cookie   I received the sandwich and was immediately pleased  this is no puny sandwich  But after taking a bite of the ice cream  my happiness quickly melted away  The ice cream was  bad   No point beating around the bush  this was substandard stuff   The biggest problem here was a distinct lack of creaminess  Instead  the ice cream was icy  Shockingly so  It felt like it was made mostly of ice rather than cream and other expected ingredients  Beyond that  the taste was lacking  There was a pumpkin flavor there  admittedly  but it was very subtle and almost entirely lacking in sweetness  I ate a few bites and threw the rest away   As for the cookie  it was serviceable but nothing special  Again  the taste was okay  it was the execution that was all wrong  This cookie was hard as a rock  I would be very surprised if it had been baked that day  I did finish it  though  but that might just have been because I was hungry   I should say in fairness that my brother was with me and he enjoyed his ice cream   He also tried mine and was shocked at how bad it was   This may have been an aberration and their ice cream might usually be delicious  but I ll never know since I won t be returning ,1,2014-06-22
The best ice cream I ve ever had  by far  Creamy with amazing flavours  The cookies and waffles are amazing too  There s no better place in the GTA for ice cream ,5,2019-11-02
There is always a long line at Bang Bang Ice Cream   Bakery for a reason  They have some of the most innovative ice cream flavours out there   Flavours such as London Fog  ginger milk  mission fig and rocky roadkill to name a few  are not only creative but delicious     On my last visit  I tried out Totaro flavour in a cup   a play on the Japanese animated character Totoro  As you can expect  it was taro ice cream but with coconut shavings   I m a happy sucker for successful Asian marketing     P,4,2015-06-26
The most heavenly ice cream joint in the downtown Toronto area  It s not like other ice cream stores with conventional flavors  because the flavors here are unique and amazing  I definitely recommend the totaro  purple yam   banana pudding  matcha jasmine twist and any of the chocolatwly flavors  Their prices are also fairly reasonable ,5,2019-10-09
This really is one of the top ice cream places in Toronto  Not THE BEST by my taste but top   I d say  They have a great selection of unique  in house made flavours so your pallet will be tickled as you walk out with some great treat of your choice   What prevents this place from taking the top spot is that they are pretty expensive for an ice cream place and the service is a bit slow  They may actually be the most expensive ice cream place in Toronto by a measure but as I say that  I m sure there has got to be some fru fru super priced place I don t know about yet so don t hold me to my word    ,4,2016-10-26
Bang Bang ice cream is delicious  Came here after work and order the everything cookie with burnt toffee and espresso ice cream   The espresso ice cream was my favourite   Will definitely come here again to try out the other flavours they have  Next time will only to the   cookie cause the   cookies and   scoops of ice cream was too much for me to handle ,4,2018-07-06
I m kind of obsessed with this place  I only went for the first time this summer  say  in July   and since then I ve been back like   other times  I will actually make dinner plans specifically in this area  just so I have an excuse to stop by and grab ice cream later  Is it worth the hype  Honestly    I ll have to say  it depends  It s pretty frustrating having to wait for like    mins to an hour in line  especially if you re just planning to order a couple of scoops of ice cream  The thing that takes the longest is the HK waffle cone  because AT MOST they have two machines there  and pretty much every single time I ve been there  only one is working  so it takes forever  I would say the waffle cone is kind of cool to try once  especially if you ve never had a HK style waffle before    and don t get me wrong  it s good  but after having it once I was over it  Personally  i think you can get better ones at Pacific Mall or some other places uptown   The reason I still come back despite the wait though is because they have so many unique ice cream flavours  and pretty much all of them are soooo so good  They sometimes have seasonal flavours too in addition to yearly staples  Most recently I had pumpkin spice  basic bitches rejoice    which tasted kind of gingerbread y but I still liked it  and candy apple cheesecake  which was so creamy and delicious and had actual crunchy candy apple bits  Other standout flavours for me in the past have been lemon  soooo zesty  I ve only seen had this elusive flavour once  but I still dream about it and hope to see it every time I m there   goat cheese and fig  sounds kind of gross  but honestly these are two things I love and they are just as amazing in ice cream form   toTARO  lychee rosewater  and london fog  The cookie sandwich thing is okay  nothing really special about the cookies    in the end it all comes down to the ice cream  I also think the prices are reasonable because most things  half cookie sandwich  HK waffle cone  two scoops of ice cream  are around       I honestly don t even care if it s cold  I ll still be coming here in the winter to take advantage of the lack of lineup  D,5,2015-11-02
the best ice cream flavours  their taro  London fog and oolong are by far my absolute favourites  downside  the ridiculous wait times and the ice cream melts almost immediately once you leave the store  so eat fast   which sucks cause it s almost impossible to bring home pints ,4,2017-05-16
I ve seen all this fuss about bang bang and decided to get there on a Sunday evening    This is a very small place with a hugeeeeeeee line at   In the evening we had about    people before we got our time at the store  Be prepared to wait     Coming to the ice cream   I wanted to get the London fog reading all the reviews on yelp and insta and asked him for a sample he game me the sample and I HATED IT  It was nothing but cold earl get with ice tea combination   I then asked him for another sample which he said no to  but a min later he gave me the burnt toffee sample    The burnt toffee was worth the wait  I ordered a ROcocoa half Sammie with burnt toffee  It was really good will definitely be coming back for more  My friend who is a huge fruit based ice cream fan went with the fig  grey owl and it was not bad either the freshness of the fig really came through      The only bad part about the experience is I expected a lot more than the place offered looking the reviews and insta    P  S  The order takes about   minutes before you get to the counter but have the patience to wait May the odds be with you ,4,2018-08-23
My go to favourite ice cream shop  The cookies are delicious  the everything cookie is amazing  The ice cream is tasteful and well textured  firm  yet soft  The shop is very cute  They even offer pints to bring home   perfect because I want to bring them home for my friends party   In terms of flavours  they truely have a very wide range from vanilla  rockyroad  matcha  lemon meringue  and campfire marshmallow   My favourite flavours include the London fog and lychee rosewater   My boyfriend enjoys the key lime pie and beer n brownbread ,5,2018-12-06
I m not a big fan of desserts until I came to this ice cream bakery  I got the nutella puff pastry with burnt toffee ice cream  One bite and I was ready to cry   but I couldn t because I m not use to the cold Canadian weather  So my tears just froze and looked like eye boogers  This place is a must try if you re in the area ,5,2016-01-13
Been here so many times now but just reviewing now   how I wish there was a location in Mississauga or that they had a bigger space  It s a well known specialty ice cream shop with long line ups pretty much all the time  especially in the summer    Recently had their burnt toffee and it was so good I didn t speak to my partner for about   minutes while I ate it  Their flavors are all hand made and uniquely delicious    Their method of ice cream delivery is ranged from HK style egg crepe  waffle cone  sugar cone  ice cream sandwich or cup  All their cones and cookies are homemade and delicious    No matter what you pick you ll love it   Just be prepared to line up and it s cash or credit only    no debit ,5,2017-08-21
Ice cream sandwiches galore  Came here for a snack before a performance at the Lower Ossington Theatre         Venue       Food       Overall  Venue  This little ice cream shop is a bit out of the way for those without a car  as it s off the subway line  but it s worth the trip  The inside of the shop is a modern take on a counter serve ice cream parlour  The reason why this is a     is due to the lack of seating and accommodation  With only a few seats on the side of the store  you re left either standing with your food  crowded at the front  or standing outside   Food  This place is an ice cream sandwich lovers dream  They have offerings such as cookie ice cream sandwiches   and your typical ice cream cones  The unique thing most people come here for are the Hong Kong egg waffles  which they serve with ice cream  These waffles are a soft sheet of bulbs of doughy goodness  and they roll them into a cone so that you can have your choice of ice cream   Overall  With quick take away options such as pints and small baked goods  this dessert shop offers a variety of items for the sweet tooth in everyone  While the egg waffles are made fresh  they are nothing extraordinary  especially if you ve had them at other Chinese places at much lower cost  I suppose the variety of ice cream flavours they serve make up the difference  Don t come here expected a nice location for a date  as the lack of seating may leave you standing ,3,2018-01-15
I found it a bit overrated  had the mango ice cream in a HK waffle  I ve tasted better waffles  and although the ice cream is fresh and made in house I don t find the particular flavour unique  I also wouldn t wait over    mins for it  as the the service is usually very slow  luckily when I was walking by it was empty  right after I ordered a huge line formed ,3,2015-10-15
Don t be intimidated by the line  It actually moves pretty quickly  I got the full sammie with a chocolate salted cookie and the everything cookie with burnt toffee ice cream and the roasted marshmallow ice cream  It s pretty good  but maybe doesn t live up to the hype  I actually really liked the cookies ,4,2019-09-04
This is my favourite ice cream spot in Toronto  The variety of flavours  and the puns used to name them  run the gamut  and I have not been disappointed by any flavours yet  Personal favourites include the rosewater lychee w  raspberry curd  matcha twist jasmine  and london fog ,5,2019-07-30
great ice cream and cookies   many different flavors   you can get the ice cream in a cone also  but i tried the cookie sandwich   note  the half cookie sandwich is decent size so save some money and don t get the full one unless you are sharing with someone else ,5,2017-09-15
This ice cream place has   defining features     Amaaaaaaaaaazing ice cream  Like  some of the best I ve had in my life  The ice cream here is very rich  flavourful  and dense but creamy  The prices are really reasonable for the amount of ice cream you get  too  The favours I ve tried are the black tea  rocky road  matcha  chocolate  and espresso  All were amazing  and I hope to try all of them one day      The wait for ice cream is super long  The shop itself is really small and if you add that to the fact that the ice cream is so popular  the wait lines are obviously going to long  Wait times have ranged from         minutes for me  but I would say the ice cream is worth it   Anddddddddd yeah  The only other thing I have to say is I wish the shop was bigger just so there are more chairs to sit on while eating besides the little benches outside the shop ,5,2016-06-29
I loved this little ice cream spot  The flavors that they had to offer were unique and delicious  I had the rosewater lychee ice cream  It was tart and refreshing  not too sweet  The golden oreo ice cream was sweet with lots of texture from the cookies  I had both of these between a birthday cake cookie which had a nice lemon touch to it    Absolutely loved this place  Would definitely go again ,5,2018-07-12
Delicious ice cream and cookies  but deducting two stars  because employees were touching the cookies with their BARE hands   I m not sure what the health code is in Canada  but in the US this is a health code violation  You cannot touch ready to eat food with bare hands  The girl brought out a batch of cookies from the back  in her bare hands and stacked them in the glass case  She should have worn gloves or used tongs  I hope management reads this and properly trains their employees ,3,2019-08-18
This is another place I ve been wanting to check out since it opened but it s so far for me to get to Ossington  My girlfriend and I bought got the bang bang chinese egg waffles wrapping two scoops of ice cream in minus    degree weather and ate it happily   The reason why i find it to me a mere four star is the following     The girl that worked there that might is not very friendly    You can t find prices anywhere  Sure they have an original Nintendo and super Mario for u to play with while you wait  but at the end of the day  you can get earl grey ice cream anywhere these days and same with the Chinese egg waffle  For the    dollar price tag  I m not sure I d come all the way here ,3,2018-01-03
Long lines but fast service  yummy ice cream sandwiches with fresh cookies  Could use some more traditional flavours rather than all creative conceptions ,4,2015-08-17
I really enjoyed my experience here  and although the ice cream and cookies are VERY tasty  I don t understand why this place still has long lines after several years  If anything  they DO need to open up a bigger location with maybe some indoor and outdoor seating  The service was great   they let us try all of the flavours and gave us recommendations  My only issue is the CRAZY lines in the summer   even on WEEKDAYS  I recommend going right when they open   I was maybe  th in line and I came when they opened  Overall  I had a good experience and will return but refuse to wait in line ,4,2018-11-04
I ve experienced both the lineup and just a walk in visit without a line   I assume this place gets really busy in the summer as I had to lineup on a Sunday afternoon during July for    minutes  They have a lot of different flavours and different styles like ice cream sandwiches  cone  egg waffle  or cup   I always have gotten the ice cream sandwiches here  One time with golden oreo ice cream with oatmeal cookie  Another time with birthday cookie with birthday doh ice cream  Cannot go wrong with any of the combinations    Only drawback is that there are not really any seats to enjoy your ice cream  There is a bench and that is all  I wish that there is a sitting area  And is it worth the lineup on a busy hot summer day  Yes  just do not lineup for more than    minutes ,4,2017-07-27
Stopped by on a rainy Thursday night after dinner  There was no wait  I ordered my favourite  everything cookie with vanilla ice cream  Flavours are on always point  There are tons of options of ice cream  You can even try some before you pick  Bang bang also makes the best cookies  I wish I could get the recipe for the everything cookie  Definitely a place to try if you love ice cream or cookies as much as I do ,5,2017-09-27
The Hong Kong Waffle is worth the wait  Make sure to tell them to make it a little crisp ,5,2016-04-11
Ice cream definitely legit  especially taro    Hong Kong egg waffles are way too dense and not very  hk  at all  They can get away with not refining their craft because people seem to love it anyway ,3,2016-05-06
Four stars because this place is pretty good  by no means I think they are the best but they are pretty good   If they had seating they would likely get five stars   Delicious ice cream  innovative flavours  open late and seating  yes that would potentially be   My usual go to here the London Fog and Soursop   However this time I changed it up and got Mango Puddin   homage to Thailand mango and sticky rice dessert    The cutest thing is after the scoop they put a piece of stick rice into the ice cream  see photo    Before you decide you can try the flavours   I believe there is      item taste test especially when it is busy   The space is small for patrons   When you walk in the counter is straight ahead about   feet long and to your left is a freeze for your take away Pints and cookies   The length is about    feet wide and when there about    people waiting it certainly becomes a congested high traffic area   On the wall is a screen where if you can manage to make your way to the fridge and plug in the console  there s an old school   bit Nintendo you can entertain yourself with ,4,2018-03-25
My friends and I has a monthly exploring day where we check out different place in the city  After reading the great reviews this place has on yelp  We decided to try this place out   My friend declared this place  the king of food place in Toronto   Location was easy to get to and the food was terrific  a lot of variety so everyone in the family can find something they like   I strongly recommend trying out their special   The staff is very friendly and accommodating    All in all  great place and we will definitely be back  ,5,2016-03-16
Mediocre flavours and an unfinished texture combined with flaky service and high prices makes for a disappointing experience   ,2,2017-10-12
Came here on a hot Saturday and it was in full swing  It is super nice that you are able to try the ice cream flavours before you order them because you never know  However  true to downtown form  this place is pricey   I ordered the vegan mojito in a cup  last time I came  the egg waffle cone was soggy and not what I fondly remembered from China town   Vegan can be hit or miss  but this was creamy and had a nice rounded flavour with pieces of real mint blended into the ice cream for a fresh taste  which also made it less toothpaste y  which a lot of mint ice cream becomes     My friend had the miso ice cream which had nice salty notes  think salted caramel more than salty ice cream   with chunks of dark cherries for a bright note    The ice cream flavours change all the time  so I will definitely be coming back to try them all  ,4,2016-06-22
It was freezing outside  but nothing was going to stop us from trying this ice cream  and I m so glad we did  Everything is homemade and delicious  I got a half sandwich with an everything cookie  one scoop of hazelnut and one scoop of MUD  mocha  almond  fudge   Worth every calorie ,5,2018-11-11
I love this ice cream bakery shop located in the hipster area of Ossington St north of Queen St  It s a small little shop with not much room other than to order and wait for your dessert or snack  Everytime I have someone visit or someone new in town I always recommend this shop  My cousin is friends with the owners a brother and sister and I found out that they have a bakery up near Ossington Station called Bakerbots which has more pastries and yummy looking cakes in addition to their ice creams  I ve been to Bang Bang plenty of times and even waited in line for half an hour in the spitting rain for their ice cream  that s how much I love it    If you want waffle bubble cone this is the place  They must ve thought it through and developed a recipe to hold up to the ice cream because it s amazing  It s crispy on the outside yet has that chewy dense waffle texture that is flavourful and not at all dry like some of the other ones I ve tried  not going to mention where      My favourite flavours so far are banana pudding   mango pudding with sticky rice and yes you heard that right coconut sticky rice  Done right might I add  The totaro is also a yummy mix of taro and coconut and the rose water lychee is great if you want something a little lighter tasting  I always get what I normally love since I crave that flavour before heading there but I should venture out  I had a chance to try the avocado and it tasted just like an avocado smoothie   For the     cookie sandwich I usually get the everything cookie with   flavours of ice cream      and ice cream sandwich is almost    and the full version is about     My Hong Kong waffle cone with ice cream was close to    and so worth it  They also do ice cream in ice cream puffs as well  A foodie friend was able to get the totaro ice cream in the last Nutella puff and that was delicious   They also have a stamp card for you to collect in case you plan on visiting often ,5,2018-11-29
That was quite a bang   Hubs suggested we try this place out  Found street parking and stood in line  The line just kept getting longer and longer as we waited  It moved slowly but trust me  it s worth the wait  The ice cream shop is cute  I like the simple decor of this place  There is no seating inside  just a small bench outside  Their flavors are displayed on a wall on large silver buckets  You can get your ice cream in a cup or in between cookies  a puff  cone  or bang bang waffle  Employees are friendly  patient  and do their best to serve you quickly    They have a nice variety of flavors  they all sounded awesome  Decided to get the London Fog  Earl Grey Tea  and Love Oolong Time  Oolong Tea  Ice Cream  With the first bite  I was in love  Flavor explosion in my mouth  Such a natural  not overly sweet flavor of tea and milk  The consistency was right on  smooth  creamy  and light  No ice crystals here  Quality ingredients are definitely used  Hubs got their ice cream sandwich  with The Everything Cookie and Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream  If you like Cinnamon  you ve got to try this one out  It wasn t overpowering and the flavors are all there  Sweet  cinnamony  creamy goodness   This place reminds me a lot of my favorite ice cream shop in LA  Scoops  We will definitely be back  D,5,2016-06-24
Look for the line up in the summer time on Ossington and odds are it s Bang Bang s line up of patrons waiting for their chance at some sweet on sweet treats   Cookies and ice cream may be the standard but if you re willing to wait for those Hong Kong style egg waffles    ya there s a time filled in a box on a chalkboard telling you how long the wait for that is   The ice cream isn t really in those containers on the shelves nobody can reach   No Shaq doesn t work there but those are just for decoration and the names of the flavors are on those in some sort of uniform  organized generic kind of way     Because of the line you ll be have plenty of time to make a decision of what you want by the time you arrive near the front of the line to get a glimpse at the display window of what has been sold out as far as cookies or specials are concerned   When I went it was Cinnabons which I luckily was able to get the last one they had which was still served warm with my choice of ice cream in the middle   Sweet treats aren t necessarily my priority in life   I mean I like bacon and fried chicken sure but ice cream which is probably my favorite of desserts doesn t even crack the top    for favorite foods for me   Ice cream is well down the depth chart so to speak as are all desserts   Just because I m not a dessert person doesn t mean I don t enjoy my occasional rare sugar overload   Yes  that ll do pig  that ll do   I have an affinity for south Florida so naturally I gravitate towards the Key Lime Pie   I mentioned the words strung together   Key   Lime   Pie  and like the trigger word of first  middle  last name from the Manchurian Candidate a girl right ahead of me turns around and shamelessly and proudly professes that I HAVE to get that   I mean I was already sold on it but now that she vehemently exclaims that her voraciousness for Key Lime Pie will stand the test of time I mean    OK I get it    you like it right   I will too   when I get to the front of the line   I swear it could have been a romcom moment there   Me mentioning Key lime pie and she just turning around and telling me that she was going to get the same except we weren t in Manhattan and she wasn t Kate Hudson     The day was warm and the line was moving slowly and when our group eventually got to the front it was like any other wait   You re happy you re finally at the front and you re happy there s people still behind you to suffer what you just had to endure   We made it  honey   My wife ended up going with ginger cookies  full sandwich  with matcha genmaicha   While I like tea I m not big on tea flavored ice cream   I mean I like tea yes but tea doesn t really have a taste to me at least one that doesn t stand out like say maple or bacon or maple bacon   I went with the Key lime pie which is to die for  good tip girl in front of me even though I already chose it  on the last Cinnabon   I tried a bit of my wife s order and it was good   I m not big on cookies but hey it s good for what it is   My choice was so good   The ice cream was smooth but with with that tart Key lime taste and pie crust  graham cracker type  was so good   The ice cream was a good consistency and contrast of texture with the crust pieces   The Cinnabon was just like when I eat Cinnabons by themselves    sweet as f ck   Icing sugar  fluff  swirly  warm and basically a twisted  spirally sin   Combined with the ice cream it was like a dream within a dream  queue the Inception credits    This place may have a line but it s worth it   There s a reason there s a line and there s a reason it s famous on a street where new is only as new as the newest thing   If you re from out of town    go here   There s so many places to eat on Ossington this most certainly should be dessert ,4,2016-08-03
Stumbled in here after craving some ice cream as it suddenly went from rain and cool to warm and sunny in less than    minutes  I was amazed at how many choices of ice cream that they had  After deciding that I wanted to get a half ice cream sandwich I stood for a good     minutes humming over the stacks of ice cream canisters on the wall  they had so many flavors from dulce de leche  mint chocolate  gluten free vanilla  butter cream  and everything in between  I finally decide on the vanilla and dulce de leche after the waitress told me that I could select two types of ice creams  She asked me what kind of cookie I wanted  I decided oatmeal  and then she suggested vanilla and dulce de leche  I took her up on this and I am so glad that I did  it was amazing  Some of the best ice cream I ve ever had  I love that they offer so many flavors that are gluten free  vegan  and non dairy  so if you have any dietary restrictions and have a sweet tooth Bang Bang is a good place to check out ,4,2016-07-07
I think anywhere with so much hype   daily line ups out the door immediately sets my expectations so high  they will never be met   I certainly can t fault a business for having a line up  but it s just not my thing  Ice cream was good  cookie was good  I had toffee   A friend had a waffle cone  which is made fresh to order  she loved it  Worth it  just expect a line  there are also about     flavours to choose from  it s tough to pick  they all sound good   ,3,2015-06-05
Loved this place  Pro tip  go during dinner time to skip the lines  The place is super small  so lines usually go out the door and around the blkck  Because there were no lines  my friends and I each tried like   flavors of ice cream    the staff was super patient with us  I ended up getting the egg waffle with ube and lychee rosewater with raspberry curd ice cream flavors  I loved the huge selection of unique and tasty flavors  which is why it took me forever to decide  The lychee ice cream was hands down some of the best  and unique   ice cream I ve had  and I eat a lot of ice cream     Would definitely come back again and again ,5,2017-09-06
Got the Hong Kong Waffle with Fruit Loops ice cream and it was really delicious  The wait was alright  since it was an off peak hour  but I was really happy with my purchase   ,4,2015-09-20
Great flavors nice staff  Loved the Espresso    long lines are cool  They would benefit definitely from a bigger joint ,5,2018-08-27
Incredibly rich and heavy but delicious  Definitely wish my boyfriend and I had just shared one  No where to sit inside ,4,2016-10-19
I don t really remember how I heard about Bang Bang  but I m so glad I made the trip downtown to try it out  It requires an extra bit of travelling  but it s certainly worth it    As I was looking over their ice cream flavours along the wall  my eyes widened and stopped at London Fog  I absolutely love earl grey tea and I knew I would love the ice cream as well  Boy was I right  The tea flavour is subtle  but there and just works beautifully with the sweetness of the ice cream  Instead of getting a half cookie sandiwich  too messy for me   I went with the egg waffle  cone  instead  It was good  but I d probably just stick with a regular cone next time    I did also have a sample of their burnt toffee flavour and it was caramel heaven imo  Definitely will try their totaro  taro  flavour next  They also have seasonal flavours as well  I mean there s just too many flavours for me to try  ah ,5,2017-12-07
Waited about    minutes in line so expected this ice cream to be well worth it    and it was   Lots of different flavors to choose from and then lots of options to pair with either cookies  bubble waffles  and turning your scoop of ice cream into an ice cream sandwich    The flavors I went with were golden oreo and matcha tiramisu  Paired the golden oreo ice cream with the stay classy cookie  regular chocolate chip   The matcha tiramisu had a good amount of matcha taste and the texture was as if it was blended with an actual cake  probably was   The golden oreo was my favourite  it tasted like an actual golden oreo transmogrified into ice cream  The cookie was warm and fresh  chocolate chips melting in your mouth fresh ,4,2018-07-16
After having been here a few times  I can t believe that I m just getting to review this place now  Bang Bang Ice Cream is right up there with Kekou Gelato in my books for best ice cream places in TO  Waiting in line here is pretty common any day of the week and especially in the evenings but for good reason   This place is amazing because of the many ice cream options available  I love how there are so many unique flavours to choose from that you can never really get tired of coming here and can pick a different flavour each time depending on what you feel like having  Some of the flavours include burnt toffee  a personal fave    lychee rosewater  totaro  london fog  milk and cookies  matcha  etc  Some flavours are also rotated as I don t always see certain ones whenever I ve visited    You can also have your ice cream as part of an ice cream sandwich  half or full  since there are various cookie flavours to choose from and I remember that you could do a macaron ice cream sandwich at one point  Of course  there s also the popular waffle and ice cream combination  A bonus is that small tubs of select flavours are available here too  The prices are fair for what you pay for and a perfect treat in the summer heat ,5,2019-07-24
Let s say I m very big on customer service and they ACED it  One it s so cute inside they are so patient with you and try and help you decide some flavors if you re unfamiliar with the place  And options      GURLLLLL THAT STUFF WASSSSS GOOODDD i can t wait to drive back to Canada to enjoy so more amazingness,5,2019-02-20
Been wanting to try this place out for months after seeing so many pictures on instagram  Got to try both the HK egg waffle and cookie sandwich   Went here on a Saturday evening  around  PM and waiting in line for over     hours  quite ridiculous   Line up to get into the store was about    minutes  when we finally got to order  waited another    minutes for the HK egg waffle to be made  as one of the two machines were broken  The people working in there are incredibly unorganized  many of them doing several jobs at once  all over the place   The girl making the HK egg waffles would do one at a time  scoop the ice cream  give it to the customer waiting  then proceed to pour the batter for the next waffle   if you ask me  I would have poured the batter first so the waffle could be cooking while other things were being done   Additionally  the same girl making the waffles at one point cashed out a customer  and then proceeded to touch the egg waffles  she did not wash her hands until we asked that she do so before handling our food   Overall  the ice cream was great  a large variety of flavours   I tried the London Fog  Black tea  Pink Lemonade  Chestnut and matcha  all very delicious  the egg waffle was crispy   but the ice cream scoops were incredibly small   I do not think it is worth it to make a trip specifically for this and to line up  as it is not very accessible by foot ,3,2015-07-27
I don t understand the hype  Came here Saturday afternoon and waited at least half an hour for ice cream with egg waffle  There is no seating area either so be prepare to eat out on the sidewalk  They had an interesting ice flavour selection and the ice cream flavour was OK  The HK egg waffle however  was a disappointment  I expected something crispy on the outside and soft on the inside  Instead it had a more rubbery chewy texture  Each waffle takes about   minutes to make so you will get your ice cream much faster if you order it in a cup or with a cookie ,2,2015-12-20
Absolutely amazing ice cream sandwiches with the chewiest cookies  Tons of selection but personally the full size is too much for me ,5,2019-03-01
Such an amazing experience  I ve never thought I would  be capable of doing line for buying food  But I have to say it was totally worth it    I tried the everything cookie with vanilla oreo and mud  It was absolutely delicious  I ll be back for sure whenever I feel like craving for a good icecream    Different variety of flavors that surely you won t find in other icecream shop  Though the products are lexpensive if you want to try a really good icecream  you won t regret it   ,5,2019-06-24
We had some friends from out of town and we wanted have them try bang bang ice creams which are really good but some hipster yuppie had no customer service training and I think the management should look at this little closer going forward   I had mentioned that thus couple that was with us our friends were from out of town from Montreal and they wanted to try it and her response was  well everybody s from somewhere    What really threw me off was the door was open and we walked in    minutes after was closed if you re going to close at    o clock closing the doors and put a closed sign on the door don t leave the doors open an insult customers as they come in  then somebody who knew the server behind the counter actually got an ice cream after and came out with it while we were still standing there   The girl behind the counter looked at us and gave us this really bad smirk it was disgusting  For management reference it was a Wednesday night see who was working that night and that s who it was ,3,2015-08-02
Going to Bang Bang Ice Cream   Bakery was one of the top priorities on my food bucket list  and this place was oh  so dreamy  My friend and I walked for    minutes on a pretty gloomy and chilly day  so there wasn t a line up to order our desserts  You can smell the bakery from outside and oh  it just smelt so sweet and I thought I was in heaven  I was set on ordering their famous egg waffle  but it took me a good    minutes to choose the two ice cream flavours  They have really unique flavours such as avocado  and I love how everything is made in house    I ordered Taro and London Fog  and I believe these are their most popular flavours  I ordered and it took approximately    minutes  I was kind of confused as to why they were only using one of the two egg waffle machines  After we received our egg waffle  I was so excited and photo op time  The egg waffle was warm  so make sure all that delicious ice cream doesn t melt  I believe the price of one egg waffle is ten dollars and it is was worth every penny  The egg waffle was huge and most importantly  the scoops of the ice cream were GENEROUS  I hate it when stores skimp out on the dessert  P   I highly recommend this place if you and your friends are craving some good ice cream wrapped in some soft and buttery egg waffle ,5,2016-07-16
This place came highly recommended and with good reason  I got the mint chocolate chip ice cream with the chocolate cookie  half size  and it was great   My fianc  had the Dulce de leche in a waffle cone and it was also excellent  The waffle cone alone might be worth buying by itself it was so good  There was no line when we got there  which was surprising based on what we ve read  We got there at about      on a Thursday afternoon ,5,2017-10-19
This place just recently opened  and I have already been four times  which I guess is a good testament to their ice cream  The cookies for the sandwiches  if you choose to go that route  are fresh and chewy and delicious  The flavours rotate from day to day  so you might end up disappointed if you have your heart set on one particular choice  But there s always plenty to choose from   I have had the burnt toffee  PB J  chocolate PB  and cinnamon toast  All excellent and delicious  Yum   The only reason I m taking away a star is because of the customer service  The first time I went when they had just opened  the girl working the counter was great and really friendly and helpful  But the past few times  there has been a guy who literally never smiles and barely looks at you while you order and seems like he d rather be anywhere else  Not the best vibe for a summer ice cream shop  But the yummy flavours keep me coming back ,4,2014-06-22
The good  how can you not love ice cream   Many great flavours  My personal favourites are London fog  love oolong time  totaro  and the miso   Although miso is seasonal    The bad  no seating  but not a big deal since it s an ice cream joint  The ugly  the longggggg line ups  Neutral  they also have very good cookies ,5,2016-03-27
Long line ups  no place to sit but still totally worth it  I got the tiramisu ice cream on a Cinnabon and it was mind blowing  Made me happy   ,5,2018-09-12
Best ice cream ever  Honestly ive been going here since they opened last summer and even worked there this summer  Still obsessed with the ice cream and the waffle   Ro and Arthur are the owners and work their butts off to make Bang Bang as amazing as it is  There s a lot of negative comments about the staff being slow but let me tell you first hand that a lot of people who stand in the line get to the front and have absolutely no clue what they want some of them not even having looked at the menu   This is definitely a place to try if you haven t already   ,5,2015-11-26
Came to this dark and seemingly desolate little stretch of Oss on a chilly Wednesday evening and there was still a small crowd inside Bang Bang   I tried a  half sandwich  which is basically one cookie cut in half  stuffed with ice cream  I chose an Everything cookie with two flavours  burnt toffee and key lime pie  The ice cream was very tasty and almost had a sponge like consistency that you could chew on for a bit  It was yummypants for sure  But I think the best part of the sandwich may have been the cookie  It was definitely the stuff cookie dreams are made of   ,4,2017-04-15
This shop has a clever concept of selling ice cream sandwiches   Right off the bat you need to know two things     There will be a line   The line will be long     The prices are on the pricey side   basically    for a half ice cream sandwich   Overall  the ice cream and cookie were fairly good   definitely not in the same league as my favorite shops around the world  but I did enjoy the dark chocolate cookie quite a lot   It s kind of impossible to eat it as an ice cream sandwich   too big messy to pick up  so you ll end up eating the ice cream and cookie separately   I do wish the staff were a bit more friendly  I think it was the owner helping me  and she just could not muster a smile despite a really friendly attempt at engagement   She also was a bit short with the customers in front of me   I guess they are working hard though   Overall  a perfectly good spot to get dessert while on the Ossington strip   Tasty but unremarkable  a little below average on value  and almost always quite a wait ,3,2014-09-23
My bf and I had passed by this few times and wondered what the big deal was  so we went one evening  closes at   pm     The line up wasn t too crazy long  as we ve noticed most times  the line stretches along ossington    We probably stood in line for    minutes  Being our first time  there were so many flavors of ice cream and so many options of where to put your ice cream on    So you need a minute or so before ordering    But I noticed they had vegan flavors and ordered the chocolate vegan with one oatmeal cookie  My bf had told the server it was our first time  hoping to get some kind of help on how   what to order   but he just nodded his head   waited  He ordered the chocolate mint with a cookie    I really enjoyed the vegan ice cream   my bf not so much with his  Price wise  we think is pretty expensive      And would we line up for more that what we did   Probably not   but its not bad if you re into the hype of a fancy ice cream    ,4,2015-09-18
Bang bang Ice Cream had so many options and different unique flavours that I slightly panicked and got the first thing I laid my eyes on  which was Avocado  I got a single scoop in a paper cup because I was full from dinner but wanted a little something sweet to end dinner with   They have lots of options such as cookies for ice cream sandwiches  and I m pretty sure I saw an egg waffle maker which I will have to try the next time I m there   The Avocado was great  tasted just like a Vietnamese Avocado Milkshake and wasn t too sweet   I am definitely coming back here ,4,2019-06-04
So many options and the staff was happy to go through it all with me  It gets very busy  Don t be surprised if there is a line  It s because it is worth it  They have dairy free options too ,5,2016-11-28
Food          Value          Service          Ambiance D cor        Against my better judgement  I almost always go for the largest size of whatever I m ordering  So I went for the full size ice cream sandwich  which meant two cookies and a giant chunk of ice cream  I got     Cookie  Captain P Nut   Cara melly   crunchy  Features  a salted virginia peanut brittle   Cookie  The Everything   Two kinds of chocolate  pretzels  peanut butter   oatmeal   Ice Cream  Cinnamon Toast  The cookies were pretty good  I don t have much to say about them  The ice cream was SO cinnamony  It tasted exactly like the cereal Cinnamon Toast Crunch  Because of the size of the ice cream sandwich  I felt like it was too much cinnamon in one go  I felt like I needed to drink   L of water after  Despite it being a better deal to get the full size  I would recommend getting two different half sandwiches because so much of one flavour can be overwhelming   You can pick two different cookies for full size sandwiches  one for half size sandwiches    It s a pretty small place with one bench and maybe two stools  so unless it isn t a peak time  which it apparently wasn t on a Saturday afternoon after brunch   there won t be much space to hang out    Not bad  Comparing this to the other popular ice cream shop downtown   Sweet Jesus   I give this place the edge just because there are some interesting flavours  some vegan options  although those are all standard flavours  vanilla  chocolate   and it feels like you re getting something a little more premium for    than a McDonald s ice cream cone with preschool snacks sprinkled over it ,4,2016-03-11
Keeping this review short and sweet   There is a variety of ice cream flavors here  very hard to choose from  The cookies are chewy and delicious  birthday cake is my fave   The burnt toffee ice cream is very popular amongst the crowd  Portions are big  Everything perfectly meshes together for an enjoyable treat on a warm sunny day ,4,2018-05-16
It s me  not you  maybe  My half  The Everything  cookie ice cream sandwich with Totaro and Earl Grey ice cream scoops was just fine  Read on to learn why my experience was only  okay    We hopped in line after dinner at Pho Tien Thanh and had a    minute wait before we got our dessert  The wait was pleasant and gave us time to digest dinner  We were sandwiched  haha   between people also visiting the shop for the first time  To the folks stressed about wait time  you are choosing to wait to buy and eat ice cream  you are blessed   When we neared the front of the line  it was decision time  Sandwich  waffle  cup  cone  What flavor s   If sandwich  which cookie    As you know  I went sandwich  The struggle I have with my very cute  very aesthetically pleasing sandwich is that you can t eat it like a sandwich without risking tragedy  We stan a Klondike bar because cookie and cream become one  you can eat it with one hand  In the case of my BB sandwich  there was no oneness  not even commingling  I spoon ate my ice cream in between nibbles on the cookie  If the cookie was a perfect chewy texture  I didn t know it because the ice cream chilled it into a tough  frozen cookie  The cookie was so cloyingly sweet I couldn t finish it  A bright spot  the ice cream flavors were unique  potent  and true to their description   My experience begs the question  Did I do BB wrong  Should I have been less risk averse re  sandwich eating  Should I have gotten the waffle  it smelled so good   ,3,2019-10-03
I was craving some dessert after having Pho and accidentally stumbled across this place  They have great and unique ice cream flavors  I got the matcha tiramisu and the peanut butter cup  I absolute LOVE the matcha tiramisu  The flavor is so rich and it s so tasty  The staff is so helpful and more than willing to let you try out the flavors ,5,2019-03-15
Bang bang has really excellent ice cream  Been here over a dozen times and I always get the London fog and the Ube on a bubble waffle cone  The lineups can be a drag but it s worth the wait ,5,2017-05-23
Line waiting simulator       all the frustration and none of the payoff    There is something clearly wrong with the process here  between poor hygiene  lengthy preparation and near farcical wait times it s hard to give you full stars The line barely moves    feet in    minutes and would have taken an hour just to be served  Clearly people like your product  maybe it s time to get some better  more competent  staff and organize your storefront to actually accommodate patrons  I don t wait this long for the most well renowned high end restaurants in the city and you were not the exception  left very dissatisfied ,2,2015-09-06
While lining up i see people on the other side of the road pointing at us probably talking about the line up craze  The ice cream is great but not enough to be pointed at like zoo animals and talked about like a fandom phenomenon  There are many other ice cream places in the city that deserves as much ,3,2016-08-24
Wut a great dessert place  The egg waffle was so so good and add homemade ice cream to it makes it taste even better  Taro Ice cream was so milky and not too sweet  The chestnut green tea was good too  Wish I could eat another one  If I ever come back to Toronto   this will b my first pit stop ,5,2015-10-29
Long lines but worth the wait  My favorite is the one that tastes like Cinnamon Toast Crunch,4,2017-09-18
One of my fav ice cream places by far in toronto  Great flavours  it never gets old no matter how long the line up is  it is worth it to me  The quality is the same every time   ,5,2019-09-07
I went there on a Sunday and I had to wait    minutes just to take a waffle ice cream  The food is good and beautifull but I am rating   stras because I think it takes so long because it is not managed as it should be,3,2017-06-06
Bang Bang  which i mistakenly read as Bong Bong  it sounds even more ridiculous aloud   try it  is one of those little shop cafe that have sprinkled along Ossington Ave recently  and it s about time  After dinner at the Golden Turtle we came here for a scoop of ice cream  and it was the perfect end note to a very filling dinner  I had the London Fog ice cream  basically  a frozen Earl Grey Tea Latte  and two cookies to go  a crumbly dark chocolate cookie w  sea salt and a chewy lemon based cookie with sprinkles called the Birthday Cookie  I didn t know what to expect but the ice cream was exactly what a cup of London Fog taste like but refreshing and light  And the cookies were just the right touch of sweetness but I regret not eating it there while it was still hot  Oh well  just another reason to go back for more ice cream and cookies ,4,2014-11-08
I finally got to try this place last weekend and even with a small line out the door  it was worth the visit  I think what makes this place is great is the assortment of flavours  some of which are pretty unique  And the fact that everything tastes good and fresh is just awesome  Try the egg waffles  and get the burnt marshmallow  It s so good ,4,2016-04-03
Be prepared to line up  I was lucky and went before the post dinner rush on a Friday  The place is small and it smells amazing as soon as you step in  I tried Noccioli  hazelnut   though you could try the bolder ones like Totoro if you re so inclined  As far as ice cream goes  it s good   nothing breathtaking or innovative that equates the hype  but decent in the Toronto summer ,3,2017-06-24
I came back for another round of Totaro  They didn t have waffle the day I went  which was a little disappointing  I paired my taro ice cream with mango coconut rice pudding  Taro was deliciously perfect as usual   However the mango coconut pudding was a let down  There s two reasons why I didn t like it      I couldn t taste the coconut flavour which was disappointing because coconut has such a rich creamy flavour to it      The sticky rice pudding was of big chunks therefore it was hard to eat  My ice cream was melting as I was trying to chew the pudding  Bleh ,4,2016-06-07
So disappointed  After waiting half an hour in line  I couldn t wait to order  However  the girl handling the cash was also preparing the orders  She quickly rinsed her hands  no soap  after handling cash  then prepared the orders touching the cookies with her bare hands    I also noticed that there were several dogs in the store  one was trying to sniff people s food as it was being served  I m sure the treats are great  but this place doesn t seem very clean ,1,2015-05-04
Not sure what the hype is about  Got the totaro ice cream on Hong Kong waffle and a full ice cream sandwich  peanuts and chocolate cookie with rocky road ice cream   Both were way too sweet that we couldn t even finish them  The ice cream melted against the waffle and cookie  The flavour did not leave us wanting more  Don t waste your time here  Luckily we didn t have to line up  Also  they only accept cash or credit  no debit  so that was annoying ,2,2015-11-04
Went in afternoon  luckily wasn t packed  Looked to go back the next night and the line was hella packed  And for good reason   Wide selection of flavors and cookies  For all my fellow Vanilla cinnamon aficionados  order w  the ginger cookie it will change your life  And for all my LA based people  think of an upgraded Diddy Riese,5,2017-09-01
 Non dairy and vegan ice cream tastes excellent  Dairy ice creams are creamy  Unique flavours   many different options to pair with your ice cream  Hong Kong style waffles  cookies and pastries    I ve been here   times already,5,2016-05-24
A really good ice cream place  There was a bit of a wait but it wasn t too bad  Got the     ice cream sandwich with the almost everything cookie and the dulce de leche ice cream  Ice cream was amazing  and the cookie was awesome  Definately will come back for more ,4,2015-04-12
Although my friends and I were in town for a short day  we had to make sure to drop by this shop for an ice cream sammy  It s quite a small joint on the side of the road  but don t be fooled  Once inside  there are many options to choose from  both pre made or ready to order  Many unique and delicious ice cream flavors and baked goods  Although I wished  I could have stayed to try and each every ice cream flavor available  I went with the taro flavored ice cream sammy on a rococoa cookie  It is moderately priced  but for the flavors and quality  totally worth it  The ice cream is simply delicious  Very pleased with my taro flavor sandwiched between a rich chocolate cookie which added a slightly salty flavor to cut the sweetness from the ice cream  Will definitely have to come back again next time I am in the area ,4,2017-11-25
