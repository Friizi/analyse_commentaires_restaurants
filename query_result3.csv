I didn t have a great experience here  I went to dinner here with my bf family and mine and the service was horrible  We ended up having   different servers and both of them sucked  The girl only check on us maybe one time  We sat there forever before anyone took our drink order  The list goes on and on    i picked this place because i heard amazing things about it but i dont see what the hype is ,2,2015-10-21
They have a cool huge outdoor pet friendly patio area with a bar  Very cool place to keep the fury kids and your screaming kids busy   The food is average  Some dishes are better than others  but overall just average beer drinking food  Their house beers are average    Service is hit and miss  but overall average   The is an average review for an average place  Not at the top of my to go list  but a decent place to hang out  be loud and drink with friends every once in a while   ,3,2017-09-13
We had our friends in town from Colorado and had a fabulous evening here  Our wait staff  Kelsey and Dan were awesome  We highly recommend this place to hang out  The food is delicious too ,5,2015-09-21
We went to OHSO for Mother s Day and had an awesome experience  I ve been to this location a few other times  and it s always been great  On Mother s Day  the wait for a table for our group was over an hour  but we were able to find a spot at the bar and enjoyed mimosas while we waited  I had my two little kids with me and the patio is the perfect spot for them to run around and check out all the dogs  I was really impressed with the service for how busy it was  and the food came out pretty fast and was great as well  I can t wait to go back ,5,2017-05-15
Just returned to San Diego after visiting my family  Awesome place  Excellent beers and atmosphere  Lots of space inside and outside  Games are also available to play  Dog friendly  We will be back  Highly recommend ,5,2018-06-28
You know the place has a nice ambience  It s quite a large place and there s plenty of seating  I had high hopes based on other reviews so i ordered a pitcher of beer  it was one of the local brews and was quite good  Decided to order the pork and rice skillet and it came piping hot  Unfortunately for me it seemed bland and probably needed more seasoning  Also  tried a couple of other items on the menu and was not impressed with those either    I would say great place to meet for drinks and watch a game but probably stay away from the food ,3,2017-01-14
Glad to have this place in the neighborhood as there is little else around that offers the fun casual atmosphere  I have had the chicken  and waffles for breakfast a couple times  The first time it was excellent  the second time not so much  Other items have been more consistent    Gripes  I love craft beer  but sometimes I like a simple light beer and I cant get one here   Also  people need to keep an eye on their children  Too many parents come to OHSO and just release their kids like it s a daycare playground ,4,2016-03-17
Pretty good food  Very small Happy Hour food plates  I like the feel  Beer was not cold and the service was fair  Still think you should try this place  Lots of fun games ,3,2017-01-14
What a great re use of former nursery in a starved local concept area  Not necessarily a fan of ohso arcadia other than great patio but kudos for pv  ,4,2016-11-01
Thank God for whoever FINALLY insisted that dogs are people too and should be allowed to dine with us  This is a great place to hang out with your friends  drink amazing beer and enjoy the moment  I met my son there a few weeks ago for dinner on a Friday evening and the place was packed  I think there had to be about two dozen dogs there too and it was so cool  They have a long trough in the yard with tap handles which pour out water for the dogs  The inside is pretty loud so your best bet is the patio especially if you do bring your dog  Can t wait to go back with my pup ,5,2016-06-28
I was disappointed with my experience  I have to go gluten free because of allergies so  I asked for my burger to be wrapped in lettuce  My burger came out with a piece of nasty romaine on top and then little pieces of romaine on the bottom  How is that a burger  I had to eat with a knife and fork  I m hesitant to go back  I probably will because everything tasted good but if I want a burger I ll go to in n out  They can wrap a burger in lettuce the correct way ,3,2015-05-12
Great service and great beer   Local selections as well as house brews and by the way the house brews are pretty damn tasty   Didn t try the food but everything I saw come out of their kitchen looked tasty as hell ,5,2017-06-09
A group of us went today for the all you can eat Hawaiian BBQ  the food was amazing  However  the downside was that it was next to impossible to get seconds  or thirds for those that were hungry  Service was so slooooow  Drinks were slow as well   I do like OSHO  but sometimes it s like waiting and watch a Sloth crossing the street  Ugh    We paid     each  never got more than one plate  Dang  big waste of money  There was much more on the menu that we could have eaten for a much better price and gotten full off of  Not worth the price for due to difficulty getting seconds ,3,2019-01-28
Great atmosphere    very friendly and inviting  Great space to sit and watch tv and drink beer    Food  not so much  Had a almost raw turkey burger with an awful side salad    Drink and be happy    don t eat ,3,2017-01-10
I moved to the area back in August and my boyfriend and I are big fans of breweries  so we have already been to several in the area  We have been to all three of the OHSO locations now after visiting the Paradise Valley location over the weekend    First of all  I will say that this is our FAVORITE of all three  Our second favorite is the Arcadia location  The menus are similar  a few differences in the brunch selections  and their beer offerings looked the same  However  the patio made this one stand out above the others  Cornhole  or bags  depending on where you are from   ping pong  and a place for your pup all underneath big fans and tons of misters    It was a perfect place for a        brunch and mimosa or    oz beer  We also had a few   oz samples for       of a few more beers we were interested in  Worth it   If you re going to go to only one of the OHSO locations  I definitely recommend this one    ,5,2015-06-15
Cool place Gloria is an awesome bartender very friendly food is good and love playing the games ,5,2017-11-07
Not surprising      awesome atmosphere with total potential but complete losers running the place   Rake it in while you can boys      no attention to detail  the servers share tips  Bernie Sanders style  wait a half hour for a cocktail or water  then another to order food  etc etc         year old protestor types managing other    year old protestor types  I would totally recommend visiting this establishment once so you can appreciate my review ,2,2017-02-25
This place has an awesome vibe to it  The beer selection is on point   its ideal for having some people with you to have a good time   catch up  However  every time I have ever gotten food here it takes ridiculously long  I came here the other day   ordered ONE entree   it literally took over an hour  All I ordered was Mac   cheese   it wasn t even that good   the service was meh  This place is also kinda pricey  So overall  if you want to come to a place for a beer with some friends then great otherwise  steer clear from ordering the food ,3,2019-03-02
This is the OHSO setup and patio by far   The lawn games make the wait for beer brunch super fun ,5,2015-04-02
A great place to hangout  The patio is amazing and has lots of games  When the weather is nice  it s the perfect place to just drink and chill for a few hours  The brunch on the weekends is very good and includes a beer or mimosa ,5,2017-04-06
I have been to many breweries over the years in Arizona alone and I can say that this is one of the most consistent places when it comes to beer and definitely food  Friendly servers and a really cool atmosphere  it is no secret as to why they are so popular  Lost Viking stout was one of the best Stouts I have had to this day  Definitely worth a shot if you ever get the chance  Only downside is that kids are left to do as they please and can sometimes be a nuisance  Overall a great place for a drink and eat ,4,2018-01-21
This place is great  Great food  great staff  Don t buy negative reviews from formerly employed pigs that got fired for stealing  Sasha seems to write a lot of petty yelps  Odd  considering she claims to be a service industry vet  Take some of the time you spend complaining about bartenders not smiling and run a lap ,5,2018-03-16
We ve been there about   times and the service is horrendous  We re big fans of the OHSO concept and love the other locations  but the owner really needs to get the staffing issues figured out at the Tatum Shea location  Food and atmosphere are great  but the poor service really ruins the experience ,2,2015-04-21
The concept is great and I foresee an improved rating down the road    At the moment  service is killing them  which is not unusual when a new location opens    The hostess stand seems overwhelmed and their fluster can start the experience in a less than stellar way    Of course everyone wants to sit outside this time of year  but because of service inefficiencies  it s not unusual for     to     of the tables to be vacant while the staff is trying to catch up    Beer selection is fine  but they are often out of some of the more popular choices  and they haven t had anything of their own yet on the times we have been there    Food has been good   And although the service is less than acceptable  the servers are friendly   Lots of great outside activities  wholesome family atmosphere ,3,2015-04-03
This place has a super cool concept  Patio  Brewery  Games  Dog friendly and good food  But maybe it is just too much going on  No reservations for    which is often a bummer because I hate waiting to eat and drink when there are a million places to eat   drink  I can bring my puppy to hang out with me on the patio      the outdoor seating is great  But there are way too many children on the weekends for a couple to have an enjoyable time    i think that if we had children it might be different for us  but really it just ended up being way too loud and too any kids running around basically unsupervised     The major plus is the DOG COOKIES for our puppy   he loves them ,3,2016-03-21
This is an update from my previous review  I went here yesterday for lunch  so obviously the place was not as packed as my last visit which was a Saturday night  Our waiter  Eric T  was awesome  Very attentive and knew the menu well  He was also sharing all sorts of cool info about Ohso  I got the salmon blt which was really good  Not as good as the one at Four Peaks  but definitely not far behind  My mom got a burger and said it was really good  Prices on beer were great during this time  I got a pitcher for     Overall  I m much happier with my second visit  Hopefully they ve worked out all of the kinks ,4,2015-06-19
The neighborhood needed a place like this  Great patio for a boozy day drinking spot  Food is hit or miss  Both times in  service was an issue  Server forgot parts of our order and one time the bartender completely forgot to order my to go food  I ll chalk it up to being a new restaurant  Beers are cold  so I m not complaining  Grab a pint  throw some bags and people watch ,3,2015-06-03
Good place to eat  Great salads and sweet potato fries  Wait staff very friendly and attentive  Have eaten sit down and takeaway  both options were fast ,5,2017-05-20
Best place in PV    Terry  the GM  orchestrated his venue like a true Maestro   What a great leader  Patrick is one of the best bartenders I ve had the pleasure of dealing with   ever   You would be doing yourself a favor if you tried this establishment out ,5,2015-12-07
I recently dined at this OHSO location with my husband  two toddlers and another family of four    we chose it because of the convenient location and the fact that the previous reviews raved about how kid friendly it is   Thank you Yelpers  you did not steer us wrong   The location was great because it was half way between where we live  Arcadia  and where our friends live  Desert Ridge    We met early on a Wednesday evening and didn t have to wait for a table    hooray   The kids made a mad dash to the outdoor cornhole area while we decided we d rather sit inside as it was a bit chilly   The staff didn t seem to mind our kids going back and forth  although we did make sure to always have an adult supervising   I noticed a few dogs dining with their families as well    good to know for those that like toting their pups around   We were able to enjoy the awesome happy hour pricing on beer and found the food to be moderately priced as well   I went with a burger that was great   The other adults went with some other burger variations and a salad  that was supposedly meh    Burgers are the way to go here   The kids had mac   cheese  chicken tenders  grilled cheese and turkey   All were pleased and they ate a decent amount  which isn t always the case     The wait staff was super accommodating of our requests as well   There really is something for everyone at this place   Wine  beer  TVs for sports fans  games for people to play outside  and a variety of food on the menu    I imagine it gets crowded in warmer weather  but hope that there will always be a spot for us when we return ,4,2016-01-05
Food is very good  service is good  and what a cool place  I love the patio  even with the dogs all over it s just a fun place to hang ,5,2015-12-07
Terrible  Hung out with my dog and girlfriend for the day  Thursday     pm  problem was that I could not reserve a table  they were booked for the night  Nor could I order food with all areas I sat in  two areas   Servers aimlessly walked by to take empty glasses yet said nothing to either of us  Empty tables indoors and out  but at least an hour long wait  Won t ever go back ,1,2015-04-03
Nice atmosphere  very similar to the Yard Culinary Dropout  but with slightly more agreeable prices   We ate here on a Sunday  and discovered their Sunday Hawaiian Luau  in which they offer a plate of different meats  pulled pork  BBQ pulled pork  and a chicken leg  and side of macaroni salad   a pineapple slice for around      with free refills on any item  Now that s a smokin  deal   A very nice setting to meet up with friends  and the kids can run around and have fun without bothering people  They also allow dogs  so expect to see plenty of them here too    They messed up our bill  but made no problems fixing it    All in all  a good experience ,5,2016-09-08
Atmosphere is great for a family micro brewery  Not much of a beer drinker myself so can t comment on the beer  The food on the other hand is delicious   especially liked the Sunday brunch  Recommend for family with kids as well   the outdoor patio gives them plenty of area and games to keep them busy ,4,2018-11-16
We really like OHSO   always consistent and you can bring your doggos  I can t bring mine as they are rotten   I love coming here for brunch and enjoying several bloody marys  because you have to try each one of their housemade vodkas    my preference is the horseradish vodka  and they have a swizzle stick that is spicy beef jerky and it doesn t get much better than that for me  They also pour a super strong and very reasonable mimosa  They always have great brew selections and the food is consistently good  I personally think their lunch menu is a bit pricey so thats why this place is mostly a brunch spot for me  But never disappointed when I visit OHSO ,5,2017-11-16
Food  beer and service were great  Very dog friendly  I got the carne asada and shrimp tacos  split with a friend   The shrimp could have had a little better flavor but still delicious  Beer is always amazing there ,4,2019-03-04
Read many  but not all     plus reviews  Great atmosphere  good food  larger portions would have been nice   Prices not too expensive  Staff very friendly  Will probably be back  EXCELLENT BEER ,4,2016-08-11
Opened an hour early   am  for the World Cup yet have no sound   No sound for a final game that is literally on every TV in the bar  Are you kidding    You have a packed bar  inside and out  with fans trying to support our country s team  that came to your brewery specifically to watch this game because you advertised you would be opening for the game  Once we were there it was too late to go to another bar with sound  we d miss the whole game    No sound for a game you advertised for  And zero effort to try to get sound despite requests for multiple customers in the bar   No coffee brewed  We drove    minutes to get to this location because we through the game vibe would be fantastic  however we were seriously disappointed  Will never go here for another sporting event ,1,2019-07-07
My husband and I came to this location for lunch yesterday and we found our experience to be odd  The location is beautiful and this one obviously does well  there were so many people here  We checked in  and the hostess who took us back seemed to have no personality  and came off very rude  She sat us in a booth with a table that barely allowed you to scoot into the booth    We waited about    minutes before our server checked in with us  we ordered drinks while we were still deciding on what we wanted to order  We loved the decorations on the inside and the fact that there is a couples tour for     for their distillery    The food was good  my husband ordered the chorizo breakfast tacos that came with an odd salad   looked more like a garnish  I ordered a turkey burger which was very bland  The fries that came with it were good but oddly were soggy    I think we d come back and try again but a different location  just weird with the servers not being super friendly and the food being good but not great ,3,2019-01-22
Have come here many times since we discovered it  I love that they love dogs  The popsicle blonde beer is light  refreshing and perfect for summer  The apps are delicious  the entrees can be hit or miss but I d definitely recommend this place ,5,2019-08-22
Oh no  I am one of the few disappointed with OHSO  Most people really seem to enjoy it   We came for Sunday brunch so I tried to keep in mind that it s a busy time  so judge accordingly  But it was just one misstep after another  They gave us a wait time but I noticed several people who arrived after us were being seated  Turns out they hadn t recorded my husband s name and information  Our server was very nice but had to be asked multiple times for things  and she really wasn t around if we were searching for her  My burger was missing its bacon  I might have asked them to bring some out but it was too hard to locate our waitress  The food was decent but our burgers were cooked medium rare  that look when you wonder if it s  too  undercooked    I think if I owned a dog and could enjoy all they offer for your pup  I might have enjoyed my visit more  As it stands  I feel it s a case of been there  done that   no need to come back ,3,2019-09-02
I love them  but I don t have a dog  I enjoy beer  and I even wait in line for craft beer releases  I like breakfast food    a lot  For me  this place is a solid      and I ll give them the round up to    That s not a bad review  but it means I won t necessarily be making a special trip to come back    I d heard several good things about this place and we were in the neighborhood at a meal time  so we figured we would give it a shot  It was pretty busy  and we did have to wait a bit  That s to be expected on a  brunch  day holiday and is one reason I typically stay at home for breakfast   Their brunch specials come with a   oz beer or a  monster  mimosa  I don t typically drink for breakfast    I just never got into that    but the beer I had with my biscuits and gravy was good  It was a porter with a hint of sweetness that nicely complemented the spice in the gravy    I enjoyed the biscuits and spicy gravy  with an  X  of bacon on top and the added over medium eggs  The portion was in the  Goldilocks zone   neither too large nor too small    The place was smaller inside than I thought it would be    most of the space being taken up by the bar    but the outside  including the game area  was quite spacious ,4,2019-09-04
I love their brunch         gets you a drink and a meal  yes please  I got the green chile breakfast bowl  it was so good  I have also been here for happy hour and I loved their Jalopeno martini ,5,2015-07-17
I always love me a good brewery  Really cool that they have a large dog friendly patio  Came here for an early dinner around       Burger was good  Beer was good  Great place to come visit for a cold one ,4,2019-10-12
Great place  cool vibe  Food is excellent  I ordered the Az burger and my Wife ordered the highly recommended Pork Skillet  Although my burger was indeed top notch  the Pork skillet is insane  Had our waitress not have been so convincing we would have never given it  a second glance as we had already passed over it on the menu  It needs a different name  A dish titled  Pork Skillet  seems so blah  Regardless it was incredible  Do yourself a solid and order it  We ll have it again when we return  and return we will ,4,2019-01-02
We ve been to the Arcadia location and were excited when OHSO opened up another location further north  So glad something finally went into this space in the Whole Foods Trader Joe s shopping center  It s been empty for years  We waited several weeks after it opened before trying it as we know that no matter how experienced restaurant owners are  it always takes time for the staff to gel and work out the kinks   We stopped in mid afternoon one Saturday  and there was still a    minute wait for a table  Lucky us  though  a couple of seats opened up at the bar  We only wanted a starter and drinks  so we ordered the Baja Shrimp cocktail  Bloody Mary and a Piehole Porter   The shrimp cocktail is billed as  sharing for    but that seems a stretch  Plenty of chips  but skimpy on the shrimp cocktail portion  It was very flavorful  The Bloody Mary was absolutely the best ever  Oh  So good  It comes with a stick of homemade beef jerky instead of the standard celery stalk  Normally this would not impress me as I have never liked jerky   I just don t get it  I guess  But I m here to tell you that you will never  I repeat  never  have any other beef jerky that tastes this good  Oh  My  Gosh  It is so delicious  And no  you can t just buy it separately  dang   The Porter was good  too bad so said   it doesn t come with a piece of beef jerky     Bartender was attentive   and super busy  The interior of the restaurant is small  but the outside seating is big with lots of orange lanterns  Corn hole games and dog friendly  how fun can it be for a dog  though  Why people feel the need to go out drinking with their pet is still a concept I have yet to grasp   but that s a topic for another place    We ll be back for a full meal one of these days  and we ll definitely be back for a bloody mary ,4,2015-05-12
Best dog friendly spot in the valley  They have   locations  but I prefer this one due to the atmosphere and amount of space for furry friends on the patio  They brew their own beer  which is super tasty   and use the leftover barley and wheat to make dog treats that they give to your dogs for free every time you visit  They also have clips on the end of each table so your pups don t wander  We really enjoy playing the fun games they have like cornhole and ping pong  And I cannot forget to mention the amazing food  My two favs are the breakfast bowl for brunch  gotta add steak   and the AZ burger for lunch dinner  If you re there during brunch on the weekend you get a beer or mimosa with your brunch too  Great deal  I also heard they started making their own vodka  I haven t had the pleasure of trying it yet  but I will be there soon for a taste ,5,2017-01-13
My first visit to OHSO Paradise Valley was mediocre until our server came up  we didn t have to wait more than a minute before our server Courtney was asking what we would like to drink and asking if we had any questions about the menu  we had TONS of questions  as we are very big beer and food connoisseurs  she was able to answer every question we had as well as give us tons of recommendations  She didn t seem like your average server  she was very upbeat  had a great attitude and just an all around good vibe  as a local business owner myself I can really appreciate exceptional customer service   This place is pretty cool the way it s set up  you can bring in your dog as well as play games  Food is pretty good  price is fair   BUT the service  it was impeccable   We will definitely come back and request Courtney again ,5,2016-03-30
Friendly staff   Ordered the brisket sandwhich and extra onion strings instead of fries  The onion strings were cooked earlier and tasted room temperature       I didn t eat them   The brisket appeared to be either a beef and sauce pre made item or they make a big batch and then hold it until it is served   The onion strings take a second so I don t know why they don t come out fresh and hot   Same with the brisket  Beef can be held and heated up with either steam or adding the sauce when heating  It tasted like it had been sitting all day s  and waiting for ME  Rather than me waiting for it ,2,2018-08-05
I really enjoyed this OHSO location when it first opened  but it has been steadily trending downwards   The decision to stop selling other breweries  beer angered me and on top of that  they raised the happy hour prices on the pitchers of beer that they make in house   Food quality also seems to be hit or miss depending on the crowds and time of day   Do not order food to go as the portion size will be cut in half   The manager that resembles John Cusack is rude and inefficient   I will not be back to OHSO unfortunately ,3,2018-02-09
Try this place if you want to go somewhere trendy but there is a reason why they can it a  nano brewery    They had only   OSOH brewed beers on tap   However  they do have a large selection of Arizona and regional beers   If you re looking for a new local craft brew try somewhere else ,4,2015-08-15
We went here at   PM  Small  but really impactful menu   amazing   friendly service  Awesome ,5,2017-10-29
HUGE shout out to Joelle  our server  and Mark  the manager  at OHSO brewery  It was our first visit  and we elected to sit outside on the patio  Talk about an atmosphere  There s music  and mist machines to keep you cool  table tennis and other games to keep you occupied while you wait for your food  Joelle was an absolute sweetheart  She suggested great beers  and food  and had a great upbeat attitude   Just before she brought our ticket  I asked for some stickers and a growler  because my fianc  and I are using growlers from different breweries as the centerpieces on the tables at our wedding  When she came back  she came with a box  filled with OHSO swag  She said that she had mentioned to Mark what we were using the growler for and he put together a gift box for us   Thanks so much for a great experience  Great food  great beer  fun atmosphere  and AMAZING people    kudos to you    can t wait for the next visit ,5,2017-05-21
Brought wife here for bday dinner with some friends   Had heard good things     Overall neat concept   Lots of beers on tap fun to sample Holiday Brews   Our company for night had worked in service industry for years   While ordering samples for beers our friend commented to wait staff  aren t you going to write these down   while order  several samples   Oh No i never get it wrong   Well Guess what   Both parties drink orderes were wrong    Asked for a Glass of water without a cucumber  had to ask multiple times took about    minutes for just the glass of water   Food was ok   Before ordering the Brisket and MAC specifically asked server if there was a good portion of meat in it   She assured me there was a hearty serving   Sauce on Mac was runny and Brisket serving was minimal   Tried to get server attention but too busy     For a Pub a Good hearty portion would have been expected   Would not make it a point to travel to get here but if in area may stop in again  Hopefully just an off night  ,3,2015-12-21
Our party waited for over an hour to get in  which was    minutes longer than we were told it would take  We ask  and were told that others were being seated because of our large party size  there were five of us  and a group of   had just been seated   Anyway  we finally got seated and were given greasy paper menus that should have been thrown away  Our food   two salmon sandwiches and two pastrami sandwiches  arrived fairly quickly  but it took    minutes to catch our server for catsup  the runners who brought the food never asked if we wanted any   Never got a refill on my iced tea  The place is noisy  and by the size of the crowd  very popular with a certain demographic  I guess I m not a part of that demographic  I doubt I ll be back ,2,2016-07-30
I have liked the OHSO in Arcadia  Tried the PV location with a group recently and was very disappointed  The service was slow for the time and small crowds  The food was subpar  The type of food that will make you think twice about returning  Burnt sweet potato fries  undercooked and overcooked burgers  Sickly looking chips and guacamole  They serve the burgers in foul smelling mini cast iron skillets  Anyway  OHSO has a cool patio and bar but the food was terrible ,1,2017-09-10
One of my favorite places to go for happy hour  Love the monster mimosa  The salads and burgers are delicious  Staff is always friendly ,5,2018-03-31
I have only good things to say about this place  I love restaurants that don t shun parents who bring their kids but would also like to enjoy a drink or two  We re all still humans    Been to the Indian School location once and to Tatum three times  never disappointed  Great value for the money  tasty food  yummy beer and cocktails  The mimosa with brunch is potent haha  Overall very happy with this place  Can t wait to have out of town guests  we ll definitely bring them here   The only thing I would suggest is the table tops on the patio tables  They re like small counters per person  and cut off so that if you had several plates and glasses it would be hard to fit everything  Wish they just built one long tabletop per table  But otherwise very happy with our visits here ,5,2015-10-18
I want to love this place because it is an independently owned restaurant in my neighborhood where we are sorely lacking options  They ve made good use of the space by capitalizing on the outdoors with tables and games and it appears that they are dog friendly  They also have a bang up bloody mary  I will go back just for it    It appears that the beers are quite good but I just haven t had the right thing on the menu yet  I keep falling back to the grilled asparagus which is hard to mess up  Service is ok but not more than ok  I asked for a side of eggs during brunch and was told that my only option was scrambled  I m pretty sure that means that they are powder or some other weird mix and definitely not fresh   This could be great but it s going to take a few iterations to get there ,3,2015-04-13
Good but expensive typical Scottsdale  Server was really good and knowledgeable on menu  Excellent choice of brewed beers  Some of the food was better than others  didn t care much for the weird salad  They have foosball tables outside and dog friendly ,3,2016-05-13
Liked it on a Sunday  not so much Friday night   Children everywhere with their mommies  daddies and guardians getting wasted   Too loud and crowded so the service was slow  Fans blowing on our food so tortillas were dried out   Beer lukewarm   Cackling ladies everywhere   Just be prepared unless this is your thing   Dogs are always the best   Hope everyone took Lyft home with their precious cargo  I e   kids and doggies   Won t be back ,1,2018-08-04
Where do you begin on such a fun place     Games for all ages outside  a wall to make funny sentences with magnets and great food and beer  what else could you want for a fun neighborhood bar   The atmosphere is all about fun and creativeness and it is very apparent the moment you walk in the door   You can sit outside  inside  or at one of the two bars   The beer menu has enough choices without having too many and the food menu has a wide selection of items to make anyone happy   I will definitely be returning to this place ,5,2015-05-25
Really cool brewery brewpub with an indoor outdoor setting   I came here for brunch and had one of the     mimosa entree deals  great price     I had the avocado toast  and it was very yummy    although it s kind of hard to screw that one up    Dog and family friendly   There was also a cornhole tournament going on during my visit  as there is a large outdoor area    Sadly  I didn t get to try any of the beers on my visit  but the list was full of local Arizona beers   If I return to Phoenix  I will stop by here again to try the beer ,5,2015-12-28
Finally got a chance to go to happy hour here  Sat in the dog friendly outdoor section     small plates and     signature cocktails were nice  as we sampled the wares  which were very good  Service was friendly and attentive    shout out to our server  Taryn  Nice atmosphere  Good music  Will definitely be back ,5,2016-05-05
I love this place   The atmosphere is so fun   Went last night and had the brisket mac n cheese   WOW  it was amazing   creamy cheesy  white sauce  big chunks of smoked BBQ brisket  French fried onions on top   SO good    and had enough for lunch the next day ,4,2016-04-04
Zero stars is more appropriate    My Wife and I have tried to eat here twice now with no luck    My Wife and I have visited the Arcadia location many times   on bicycle  with our pooches  with friends   we ve visited the N SDL location to without incident    This location however refuses to seat us  The first time we didn t want to wait the   hrs our hostess told us  no fault to them  The  nd time  we were told    min wIt to sit outside and    min wIt to sit inside   I walked inside to see if there were seats at the bar and saw   open tables  upon walking out I saw   open tables outside   not to mention I didn t see anyone waiting outside    Some of the worst service I ve experienced at any local eatery in Phx  I won t be trying a  rd time   if I ever do frequent Arcadia again I will praise them for their location and let them know what we think of the PV spot   Head to Oreganos maybe     mile up Tatum  All the service staff is friendly  beer and food is good  just can t bring your pooch ,1,2015-05-10
My first experience with OHSO was years ago when I was introduced to the arcadia location  Back then might have been my first time tasting fruit  flavored beer  Now that flavored beers are a norm I had acquired the taste of stout beers  Needless to say had the four peaks nitro brew hit the spot to compliment the artichoke dip with tortilla and pita bread  I really always have a good time at this place and the variety of taps are for basically any palette you desire ,4,2018-03-05
Always a great time here  Staff is friendly and beer is great  Love the concept and dog friendly patio ,5,2019-01-20
I love this new location  The food is awesome and they always have the best beer choices  The first time I came I had a bartender named Jeanette  She  is so fast and friendly  she s not here this time but I m sure these other bartenders will be just as good  All together this place is awesome ,5,2015-04-18
Atmosphere at PV location is the best  Large  open  airy space  Huge outdoor patio  Family friendly  dog friendly  Food is creative brew pub fare  Turkey burger  chicken and waffles  biscuits and gravy  Green Chile burger  and pretzel board are must haves ,5,2018-04-29
I love this place  Boom Dynamite is easily one of my favorite beers  I got it the first time I went  and now it s very tough to pick anything else  Last time I went I got carnitas tacos and they were scrumptious as well  I m excited about trying more of their food  Five stars is for the relaxing atmosphere and oh so  OHSO  hehe  tasty beer ,5,2017-09-06
Love the atmosphere of this OHSO location  My go to favorite dish is the Veggie Burger with a side of Jalape o Polenta and a Orange Petal beer ,5,2018-05-07
This is a very cool place   Sitting outside    nice day   Nice atmosphere getting ready to try their turkey burger  The cucumber water is refreshing   Brian tried their Blueberry milkshake beer it s very good    Sweet potato fries are the best and the Turkey Burger is the best one I ve ever had   This is now my favorite burger place I think Brian s too he had the brisket and ate the whole thing  ,5,2018-05-03
I came here with my dog Bailey to have a play date with her brother  OHSO was a great location for the pups to play  I was at first skeptical of the outdoor seatings mainly for the dogs sake being that it s hot in Arizona but with their misters going on  the weather outside did not seem that bad    They even have a beer water fountain for dogs as well as a play area with artificial grass    I ordered their short rib tacos and it wasn t too bad  I didn t get to try any of their beer selections last time but I m looking forward to it on my next visit    P s  they offer a meat patty option for dogs and they give treat bags up front for when you leave ,5,2018-08-21
First time eating here  and not only is the food great  but they cater to our furry friends  Loved my sol salad and the sweet potatoes were delicious   We sat in their outdoor patio area and I just loved the bicycles that had fans built into them  Perfect way to cool off in the Arizona heat  Complete bonus  were the gorgeous views of the mountains ,5,2018-09-04
We love OHSO  We ride our bikes there and take the dog  Love the dog treats too ,5,2016-01-19
We ve been wanting to try this place out for awhile now considering it s in the same vicinity as where we practice yoga  Corepower Yoga  and hoped to make it a potential regular spot but the customer service was not very welcoming  food was just okay   and some items on the menu are overpriced for what they give you  For starters we arrived around    p and the place was not busy  The hostess gave us a mediocre welcome  we could tell she didn t want to be there  and sat us to the very first table she saw outside which was next to hostess stand  Our server was Natasha who was nice and personable  The appetizer section on the menu says  to share with    so we thought between the   of us  the buffalo chicken dip with chips sounded good  We looked at the price which was        so we assumed for that price it would be a big serving size  Nope  It came out super quick so I m guessing we can roll out the freshness of it  at least give us warm chips   For        we could feed a whole potluck making our own buffalo dip and probably have left overs  When we asked if we could have more chips because it wasn t enough for    photo attached  it didn t come out till the end when we were ready to close our checks only to find out later we got charged another     for this dip  We got the Arizona burger for our meal which was pretty good  I was never asked if I wanted a soda refill till the end which by now we were ready to go home      ,2,2019-04-18
We live across the street so we go here often  Beer selection is great   love that they also have cocktails  Really large space with option of indoor or outdoor  with games  The food is delicious  We sometimes go for the Sunday BBQ  I recommend checking it out ,5,2018-08-05
Used to love this place and the     beer brunch  Over time I ve watched the portions shrink and the plates change to help hide the fact you re getting half the amount of food  Okay  fine  No biggie  I m sure     beer brunch wasn t profitable and money needs to be made to keep lights on  I get it  Restaurant business is hard  I didn t need that much food anyway  I d take half of it home  But now they ve changed their diced potatoes into  potato barrels   Which is a fancy word for tater tots  And not the good kind  I paid     for a handful of salty tater tots mixed with a scrambled egg and cheese and pico  Oh  and a small spoonful of guacamole  Denny sserves a better quality breakfast  DENNY S  I m heartbroken and won t be returning ,1,2019-10-20
Ive been to the one in Arcadia So I m trying this one out  Im not a IPA or Hoppy guy Im a Newcastle loving ale guy and    ale is the closest to a decent smooth ale  its not Newcastle but the      will do   Wasnt in the mood to eat and if i was the brisket with mac would be my choice but again only drinking So the bartender introduced me to     minute Not to be confused with     minutes the best music MTV ever put out  Anyways     minute is     WTF im in heaven with this boozy intense bold IPA Ill give this place   stars but my only complaint is no Lakers channels Why    ,5,2018-12-24
Loveee OHSO  You ll catch me their almost every Sunday enjoying a mimosa and bomb food with my pup  The vibe  customer service and overall food is great ,5,2019-04-12
I invited some friends to a happy hour here and it was a blast  Then I went back with my hubby to listen to some live music and it was again so amazing  I think the dogs steal the show  but the servers are all fun and very informative and will re fill your drink if you spill it  or well if someone spills it    The pretzels are terrific and the patio is so chill  Go when the band Suga beat is playing  They are the very best ,5,2019-05-09
OHSO is a solid spot to grab a beer and some snacks and hang out with friends   They have a large amount of space with indoor and outdoor seating   I stopped by for dinner and some beers   I tried a couple beers and they were pretty good   The food was about average   It hit the spot  especially after a couple beers   but was not mind blowing   For the vegans of the world your options are limited     The service was friendly  though the waitress was not really a beer person so she wasn t able to answer more technical questions about the beer    Overall not a bad place to grab some beers ,4,2019-10-02
The best OHSO  Huge patio  plenty of room to talk to friends or watch the games  Dog friendly without feeling overrun by other people s pooches  Food ranges from decent to definitely good  I m a fan of the Hawaiian BBQ Sunday afternoon plate  and the Beer Brunch is a good late start to a weekend morning  We bring out of town guests here often  and prefer this location to the good  but overcrowded  Arcadia location and the somewhat bland Scottsdale spot ,4,2016-09-03
Excellent service and really cool atmosphere with the garage doors and openness of the space  The in house flavored vodkas were good too  The apps were tasty too  we had the Artichoke dip and Chips with Guac  The Asian Chicken Salad was excellent and nicely dressed  The carne asada tacos were good too  I would go back ,5,2018-09-08
After eating here several times  it is one of our favorite places to go  We love the happy hour specials  the outdoor seating and pet friendly atmosphere  The staff is friendly and the food is great ,5,2018-01-24
Ok  First this place is amazing  Second this place is amazing   The atmosphere here is perfect  indoor or outdoor    You are able to bring your dogs  have lawn games and plenty to see and do while you enjoy your food and beer    I started with a flight of beer  And ended with a flight of beer  Just the one  Bit of a light weight  Or bit of alcohol content  Followed by a chicken sandwich with fries    All the food  the service was amazing  The facility it self was well kept and kept clean  The only real thing that bothered me was the tables  They were super awkward to eat from  at least the lounge seating we were at  Overall a comfortable space  just those dang tables    We will definitely be back with the fur babies in tow and spend some time there getting to know those flights a bit better ,4,2019-10-15
Honestly so disappointed  Here on a getaway and although the ambiance was beautiful  the service was not   We had a server named Alana i believe  according to our receipt  she really disappointed us  We were a table of   and we all had the same complaint  Slow service  she rolled her eyes a couple times and although they were  busy it showed on her face  Not to mention after one of us ordered a beer she had put it on the table so hard it spilled on my Pants and she didn t even apologize for it  She dropped off the drink and ran off  So Rude   We asked two cancel two items and she got annoyed about it  After telling her we ll take the items because she told us they are ready she still charged them for us  It s not about the money but the inconvenience she didn t even give a simple apology  All she did was roll her eyes half the night  We also ordered the all you can eat luau and after we ordered it  she said it was sold out and we were only able to get one plate  Half of the party didn t get their food at the same time  We all ate separately and we had to constantly remind her about our orders  What s the point of eating out with friends when we are all eating at separate times    All in all  she didn t care to help us and we all won t be back at this location in the future ,1,2019-01-28
The beers were very yummy at OSHO   We also had dinner and my AZ burger was really good   The restaurant has a fun atmosphere and the staff was great ,5,2017-11-02
OHSO Brewery is an okay restaurant  It is always packed  inside and outside  The service is okay and the food is okay  The outside area is really cool because they have many different games like ping pong  foosball and bean toss ,4,2015-10-26
Ohso has a great concept    Giant patio  booze  brewery  games    You really can t lose with that combo  I came to this location for a party  and it was nice  I tried many of the apps     All decent  The cheese sauce  Mmmm  I had the steak fries for my entree and this thing was huuuuge  The flavors were delicious and the steak seemed to be high quality  The cocktails were fairly tasty  I would return ,4,2016-03-06
OSHO  CAUTION if you are any shade varying away from Caucasian when patronizing the PV location  You see  we are brown  I have been spending my hard earned cash at OHSO since it opened    years  It was my favorite place  In fact  my cousin and I couldn t wait for this particular location to open its doors  You see we are both Mothers  I have lived in this neighborhood for    years  We were both excited about a restaurant that seemed to be both family and dog friendly  I have hosted my birthday party here  a high school reunion get  together  family dinner and business lunch here    Late Aug       while having dinner at the PV OSHO with my girlfriend and my son  I was detained by a uniformed police officer  I was not only confused  I was terrified and worried  I was detained right in front of the restaurant because the establishment contact the Phoenix Department on my   year old who was using my cell phone next to the back patio  My son could not hear his friend due to the noise in the establishment  My son has been to the neighboring businesses for the past   years  For example  We shop at the Trader Joes and Whole Foods next to OHSO  Also the reflexology massage two doors down from OSHO I routinely give my business to a few times a month  The point I am trying to make is that my   year old is very familiar with the area  We are regulars  not only at OSHO but the in the entire shopping plaza  The police officer began to ask me if I knew where my son had been  why yes I replied  he just checked in with me    min ago from the patio    The police officer began to explain to me that my son was wondering around  Why would he be wondering I thought  What the police officer did not tell me is that he and another uniformed police officer who were contacted by an employee at OSHO  bullied my son  tore my cell phone out of his hand and proceeded to interrogate me on my son s whereabouts  All because my son chose to use my cell phone at the back entrance   As a parent you bet I was concerned about where they were coming from and what exactly had happened  I did not get the opportunity to hear my son s side of his story  So not only was I bullied by the   officers  but it was done right in front of the restaurant  Its patrons  the employees and my son  One of the officers asked me how much I had to drink to which I replied NOTHING  I was there for dinner and conversation  I was detained and harassed almost an hour  Not only was this experience the worst for any parent to go through there was absolutely no reason for it  NO THANK YOU OSHO ,1,2018-01-15
GREAT spot to bring the pups  Awesome craft beer selection and the spare rib tacos where perfect  Being from Texas Austin San Antonio area it s hard to compete with dog spots but I found a place I ll be back to regularly ,5,2018-10-06
We heard about this place from other dog owners and decided to take our two crazy Bassets  One of the coolest places I ve been too  big patio with lots of seating and bags and ping pong tables  Almost everyone on the patio had a dog too  Very kid friendly also  We will definitely be coming back   Lost a star because the food was was ok  We had the guacamole which had raisins in it so I wasn t a fan of that as I love spicy food  I had the carne asada tacos which were just ok also ,4,2015-06-14
One of my absolute favorite venues for brunch  They have a beer brunch or Mimosa brunch when you get a free beer or Mimosa with your brunch meal  I love the avocado toast or the fruity pebbles French toast  Great service great venue with a huge outdoor patio and you can bring your dogs  Great beer options including Growlers to go  all around fabulous spot ,5,2018-04-22
We finally went to this place I ve heard so much about  We met three friends a family we have not seen in a while  Good place for the         ages in our group  crowd   It s great and right in our own backyard  Food was great we had burgers   fish tacos   split a Sm pitcher of their own lite beer  Cute idea to allow folks to bring their dogs  The out door games were a fun element  Enjoy now or in the summer heat  Try it  It s right behind Trader Joe s across from Frys Grocery ,5,2016-12-04
I may have almost shed a tear when I found out an O H S O would be going in at Tatum and Shea  I waited  sorta  patiently  and finally got to eat there yesterday evening  I was happy that there was a sizable crowd when I arrived at   PM on a Wednesday  God bless late night eateries  And super god bless late night eateries that just so happen to also be breweries  YES     stars for ambience  How in the world did they turn that unassuming  bland strip mall location into something wonderful with great character   It reminds me of the Vig uptown and the Yard  The design is more creative than the other two locations  and much larger  Also  as an ex Boing employee  I appreciate the giant helicopter blade fans   Of course  as the place just opened  there are still a lot of kinks to work out  I had been hearing rumblings in my neighborhood about warm beer  messed up orders  and bad service  My husband and I ended up experiencing some of that as well  I ordered the Summertime Cocktail  a muddled basil drink  and they forgot the the basil  Maybe that s karma for not ordering beer at a brewery  My waiter was nice of course and brought out a new one  Our table took  wobbly  to a new dimension  It was as if it was missing a leg entirely  It was a good laugh though  it almost felt like we were being set up on a hidden camera show   My husband  who has the largest appetite of anyone we ve ever met  ordered the diablo burger and only ate half  Good value  I got the blackened salmon tacos  Salmon is not normally my favorite fish for tacos  however  this really worked  The seasoning and flavor was nice  This too was a hardy portion for fish tacos  My only complaint was the under seasoned  very soggy coleslaw  I m guessing everything will vastly improve in the coming months   I ve definitely had worse experiences at newly opened restaurants  eg  the opening of Pomo at Gainey Ranch  sheer disaster  twice    I will be back  often  I m still grateful this place opened up in my hood ,4,2015-03-20
I love OHSO  The atmosphere is fun and welcoming  Everybody that works here is great and really enjoys their job  Their spirits and beer brewed in house is fantastic  My favorite is the Orange Pedal  Their appetizer hummus plate is a great start  I would like a little more pita or cucumbers on there   They have a fantastic happy hour  Dogs are welcome to enjoy the beautiful patio  You Will not be disappointed ,5,2018-02-09
I am editing my review as we gave this place another try and it seems as though they have made improvements  Friendly service today and my Asian chicken salad was excellent and I was happy to see that they now have an allergy friendly menu  My husband enjoyed his Cobb salad but it was way overpriced at        since he added chicken    This was our third visit   The food has always been mediocre and the service decent  prior to tonight    We liked it because of the outdoor dining and the recreation for the kids   Tonight was pretty much a disaster   Our server was on another planet   We ordered our food specifying some SERIOUS food allergies and he seemed annoyed to be put out   My dish was served first with no explanation as to when why the other plates were not there   We waited an additional   minutes for the other   meals to come out   When my son s plate arrived  it contained the allergen that we specified extremely clearly could NOT be on his plate   The gentleman that delivered it apologized and I saw him tell our waiter but he never came over and apologized  He avoided us  They did bring the new non allergen dish within a few minutes   I asked for refills of water   Only my glass was filled   it was hot out and all of our waters were drained    My other son is a foodie and ordered the mac   cheese because that was the most highly reviewed menu item   It was awful   Don t dine here unless you just want some recreation or a spot for your dog to hang     of   meals mediocre and extremely bad service   OHSO disappointing ,4,2015-08-04
Just had the absolute worst experience here  Went in and ordered   drinks a mimosa and a Bloody Mary at the back bar outdoors  First  the bartender was completely non responsive to us for about    minutes  perhaps not hip enough   then he finally waited on us  Ordered a     mimosa and     Bloody Mary  While my husband was signing the tab  and yes we did leave a good tip  my husband basically touched the top heavy Bloody Mary  The drink went over  Any good bartender  and yes I have children in the industry  would have given another drink at no charge  as yes there was customer contact  but the drink was way too heavy   This guy looked totally annoyed at the accidental spill and said if you want another you pay for it  it wasn t my fault  I have been totally at fault for an accidental drink spill and received a replacement  Sorry to have an accidental spill and ruin your day  normal part of your profession and I d say this bartender better learn to handle it bett,1,2018-03-10
Want to go to OHSO  Sure  then why are we at Home Depot  It s not Home Depot  just looks like it  It s looks more like Home Depot than Home Depot does  We tried OHSO on Tatum hoping the food beer is better than the Indian School location  Um  no  not really  actually not better at all  I looked at the menu and ordered a beer  I m at a brewery right  Well they didn t have THEIR beer  The server informed us they only get the leftovers  more on that later  from the Indian School venue and today they didn t have beer  Ok  I ll have someone else s beer  IT was good  Their entree  here comes the leftovers part  Brisket   Mac  WOW so underwhelming  I and my friend were hungry but that was the only reason we ate this dish  It was like the kitchen had an order and didn t know what to do with it  So they scrambled and slapped whatever leftovers were hanging around and plopped it in a bowl  Not good   If you know anything about brisket you know that it s very hard to cook well  It s tough and most times requires being cut on the bias to make it chew able  Well when I saw Brisket   Mac I was expecting a few slices of brisket and a side of mac  It was all in a bowl  Weird  The bbq sauce overpowered everything  the mac was in some sauce  not like cheese sauce  just some weird sauce  And the brisket  ugh  I had to swallow the brisket because I got tired of chewing  What a mess  So OHSO  once again you have let me down  That s   for    And again  if someone asks if I want to go to OHSO  my reply  NOTSO much ,2,2015-03-23
Love the new Tatum location  Its bigger  better and a very fun atmosphere  The patio is HUGE with misters  corn hole and ping pong   Service is fantastic  food   happy hr hummus  small serving   good shrimp tacos  brisket mac  slight BBQ flavor  just perfect  and guac  it has a little bacon and cherries which are surprisingly awesome  are outstanding  Bring your dog on the patio   they have a super cool water trough for them to drink from  The water comes out of beer taps   I d bring my kids and dog  but only during the day  Fri or Sat night is busy  We waited   hours for a patio table this past weekend ,5,2015-05-01
Love Ohso   We go here all the time with or without kids   The food is good  the beer is great    and the other email ambiance is fun   They have love music outside on the weekends which is awesome since they have corn hole and ping pong also     You can sit on the patio with dogs     but may need to wait for a suitable table as this is a popular spot   The street tacos are a favorite for us on the food menu ,5,2017-03-17
Found by accident looking for dog friendly patio    Fabulous deck with water for pups and great fans and seating  I don t eat sugar or flour and they were very accommodating with changes  Will return for sure,5,2018-10-07
Beautiful salon  great stylist and loved my blow out   Highly recommend and would go again ,5,2017-07-10
I love the beer options at OHSO and I love the atmosphere  but the last   times I ve gone to this location there has been multiple open tables and yet  there is always at least a    minute wait    and there is no one waiting out front  but us  The last time I waited to actually be seated despite there being open tables  the service was pretty poor and so I would only recommend the FLW location at this point ,3,2017-02-25
Cute spot and love the dog friendly vibe of customers and staff   That was refreshing and would honestly be the only factor to bring me back to OHSO   Food and service were both mediocre at best   Our bacon free guacamole arrived with bacon  which accidentally went into the mouths of one of our four vegetarians  rest assured that wasn t pretty   They replaced it promptly   My salad arrived       minutes after our table of   got their hot food  what s up with that    Despite the more spacious  ground booths  being open  we were crammed in a c shaped booth that sits up a foot off the ground   not comfortable for   and two pooches who want to be on the ground   Our server was not friendly and not attentive     had to ask for everything  including water  multiple times ,2,2016-04-29
I like the bar with all the beer choices  We came in late and the had specials after  pm where we could try several fun appetizers,4,2018-04-23
I ll start by saying I m a fan of the original location on E  Indian School  and love the beers  the vibe and the casual  dog friendly environment   I was very happy when the location near me on Tatum and Shea was opened   Unfortunately  this location has essentially become Chucky Cheese with beer   The last few times I have gone  there were nearly as many unruly  unsupervised children as adults   Not being a crusty  child hating geriatric case  I consider my tolerance level for kids to be at least average   However  patio area was absolutely unbearable   Who has their toddler s birthday party at OHSO     And where is management when kids as young as   or   are running through the patio area tables screaming  pounding paddles on the metal tables  etc   This location isn t just suffering from an identity crisis  playground or pub restaurant   it is also a potentially serious safety issue  not the least of which is due to beer guzzling parents who can t seem to understand what a babysitter is for ,1,2016-02-17
Really fun and friendly atmosphere  great food  and the best dog friendly place I ve been to in PHX  My dog LOVED the homemade cookie OHSO gave him  Will be back   many times,5,2015-06-27
This place is pretty awesome  I want to come with some friends and take advantage of the outdoor game area which has fans and misters so even in the summer it s not too hot  Came for brunch with my toddler and loved the bagel and lox  even got an    month old to eat smoked salmon  The drink beer mimosa included in the brunch price is great  I can t wait to come back and try some of the regular menu options  Definitely a friendly place to bring your dog along ,4,2015-06-13
My favorite hangout  love the staff  always so friendly  usually get a seat quickly  The food is great and there is a good variety of healthy options  You can always try a beer and the bartenders are willing to create a mix drink not on the menu ,5,2019-01-26
OHSO is a fine  fun brew pub   Their acceptance of dogs is getting a little too much to tolerate   Lately I have been in a couple of their locations where dogs are sitting at the bar   Yes    taking up a seat at the bar   The staff seems to tolerate this but when it s crowded or you wind up sitting next to a dog    that s a bit much  not to mention a bit unsanitary ,3,2019-01-29
Great family and meeting place  Food great especially the Kale and chicken soup  Patio spacious  ,4,2016-12-29
Food was good  but the service has been awful every time I ve visited  From the hostess to the bar  I have been disappointed multiple times   Somehow it seems to stay busy  but we aren t planning to go back ,3,2016-09-20
Oh no no no no beloved OHSO  Deep fried hospital tater tots for breakfast options today  So incredibly dime a dozen and ick  PLEASE up the ante from prior potatoes    Fresh rosemary  Garlic  But no tater tots  Hurry  It s a crisis ,1,2019-10-12
Jenna the Manager was a little bit rude  We had about   tables for our group and she wasn t too inviting  You d think for customers who spend about        in food and drinks would get treated a little better  We ll be back in the future  we didn t enjoy her managerial ethics too greatly  Other than that  the atmosphere is great    Food was pretty good  drinks were pretty good as well ,1,2016-08-20
OHSO is a cool spot  We have a young Husky so it s great they re dog friendly  They also have some of the BEST stouts I ve ever tasted  I would definitely recommend them to anyone ,5,2019-04-28
We absolutely loved this brewery  I have traveled all over the USA And never come across something quite like it  Now it may have been because it was     degrees out so they had the misters going but the atmosphere was sooooo cool  I really don t know how to describe it  This huge outdoor area that is dog friendly was hustling and bustling with some live music   We ate indoor for breakfast and came back later for dinner as we left our credit card there lol so why not we liked it that much to eat twice same day   I liked the atmosphere more than the food but the food was good  Breakfast for me has a little bit too much avocado I can t believe I would ever say such a thing  I mean it is avocado toast  But you can easily scrape some off  It came with a huge mimosa which I chose half pineapple half orange juice  That was very good  Our waitress brought my husband out a flight of beers to try and he choose a grapefruit one that went well with his breakfast  For dinner I had Mac n cheese which wasn t my favorite it was a little too watery for me but hubby has the AZ burger and loved it  The fries were good   I would come back in a heartbeat just to enjoy the music and chill atmosphere ,4,2019-09-04
Went here for brunch and it was delicious  I enjoyed the French Toast  while the other members of my party tried the avocado toast  biscuits and gravy  and the burrito  Everyone enjoyed their meals  the cocktails were tasty  and the outside seating was a nice plus  The patio is dog friendly and it s a great value too  Will definitely go back in the future ,5,2019-05-10
It was wonderful  The outside seating is beautiful and very spacious    We order burgers and they come with fries  The burger was super juicy and the onion rings were super crispy that came within the AZ burger  My favorite is the jalape o cream cheese inside of the burger   I got some flights for our drinks  The bartender was very knowledgeable    The only thing I was not a fan of was children running around the outside and taking over  I understand parents are out here drinking and socializing and have kids  but this kids    Like my mom would say  desmadrosos  just too loud for my taste  As an adult I m not looking to hear children screaming or running around the bar when I go out at    p m on a weekday ,4,2019-10-06
OHSO is great  I love the atmosphere outside at this location  Fun things to do outside while enjoying your meal  Katie our server was friendly and attentive to our needs  We enjoyed the Happy Hour goodies  a couple of pitchers of beer and we sampled Everything on the small plates for    during Happy Hour   We loved the selection of goodies something for everyone  My one suggestion is chilled glasses for the Beer please  ,5,2018-04-29
I have been to this OHSO about a half dozen times over the past year and a half  pretty much always hang out on the patio with the dogs  kids  and the entire neighborhood    I have friends who swear that a brewery   small children   no bueno but I think it all depends on the brewery  OHSO PV is more of a neighborhood hangout eatery   drinkery  The families that show up for brunch  the parents who pick their kids up from school and head directly to the outdoor section with the games  the office mates who do happy hour at the outdoor bar and everyone brings their  well behaved  dogs  All the ingredients for a fun  low key place to have a conversation and share some laughs with tasty brews and some of the best bar food around served to you by a friendly and efficient staff   The only thing that stops OHSO from being a   star spot in my humble opinion is that the entrees and sandwiches have been at times a miss  So  I stick to the cheese curds  the tacos and the guac    The happy hour deals are ridiculous and such an incredible value  so don t forget to ask about those because it could be worth your while to order a pitcher instead of a pint ,4,2018-12-13
Great neighborhood spot   My husband and I go here often for dinner  brunch  drinks with friends  lunch with the dog    we love it ,5,2019-03-18
Always love this place  relaxed easy vibe delicious avocado toast and the most amazing gluten free chocolate desert   Fun tunes and a always full and lively   Definitely a go to spot ,5,2019-01-01
I will definitely be back here  A great place for happy hour and if you have kids or pets  The food is reasonably priced as well as the drinks  lot s of places to sit  although get here early because it gets pretty crowded quickly  just a nice place to come grab a drink with friends  or families due to the games you can play outside  ,4,2015-04-11
Ambiance is amazing  and we love the Saturday Sunday brunch  especially since its dog friendly    We ordered the chicken and waffles and the brat hash  and both enjoyed our food  The entrees were fairly priced  and also came with a free mimosa    Overall  this place is a        and I would have given it   stars  but I think the place is a bit too big to be efficient  We could tell that our food had been sitting for a bit  waffles were cold  and the hash was just warm  instead of hot  It was busy  so it s understandable  but for a   star review  they definitely should figure this out ,4,2019-01-13
Great place  great staff and the outside patio is one of the best dog friendly locations in the valley ,5,2019-04-22
My spot   The PV location has grew tremendously over the past few years where I would highly suggest calling ahead  Brunch is THE PLACE TO BE  Great mimosas  amazing brunch from  Fruity pebble French toast to a breakfast burrito and yummy avocado toast  For lunch the fish tacos or BBQ burger you can t go wrong with  Best part    it s dog friendly   Of course they have a great selection of beer as well  although I suggest they get colder glasses since it s so hot outside now ,5,2018-05-07
I love OHSO    Never had a bad experience   Went in yesterday with    people   I made a reservation a week prior    When we arrived our table was ready    We had great service and everyone loved there food and drinks   Highly recommend it to everyone ,5,2018-02-19
First of all  this venue is spectacular  As soon as you walk in there is a huge outdoor seating area  There is cornhole and plenty of games to play  It is bright and inviting and every single employee we encountered during our visit was happy and knowledgeable  We had their  hoppy  IPA  We had a pitcher during happy hour that was     Their guest beer list was extensive and I had a great Moonjuice IPA as well  We shared some guacamole and then split the shrimp tacos and it was all delicious  We re in town for the final four and we re actually on our way back to this awesome little place ,5,2017-04-04
Brought my pup in for the  st time for brunch today  Every server   the hostess stopped by to make us feel welcome  Great experience  Would probably not have chosen a seat in a booth near the entrance if I knew better  Too many opportunities for Jasper to be the host  Food   beer was good  Felt the love except no one offered dog treats  Will be back ,4,2018-05-28
Really disappointed with the back area bar staff outside  one of the bartenders was more into his friends rather than even acknowledging me  I ll admit  I enjoy coming here for my two dogs but tonight was disappointing  I actually decided to come inside to the main area to order my drink and later came back to order my food because it was the only thing I could do to get service  I understand being busy and it s a Saturday night  But customer acknowledgement goes a long way and that s all I want especially when paying good money for a night out  My advice  look at the big picture even when it s busy ,1,2018-04-08
Went to try out Hawaiian BBQ Sunday afternoon  Big  noisy  Sat on patio bc indoors dark and uninviting  Seated close to band  So loud we couldn t hold a conversation  Had to ask to be moved  which they did with only a little eye rolling  Beer selection great  BUT be sure to ask for a taster first  One of our Party ordered a blonde beer with a great tasting description  but it was soooooo hoppy and bitter she couldn t drink it  I tasted and agreed with her   They took it away but didn t offer to replace it    The food was OK but nothing to write home about  Need to serve with sauces  Bok choy cooked like collard greens is a bad idea  Big tough bitter white cores  A great pot of spicy turnip greens would have been so much better  BBQ chicken  good  pulled pork  meh  and BBQ pulled beef  ok  and great mac salad  Before  pm seconds free  Needs a plating rework  tho  Nice to try but no repeat planned ,3,2017-09-20
This was our second try and we probably won t be back  The outdoor area is wonderful on a beautiful day and I get that people want to bring their dogs with them  I don t  however  want to be surrounded by competing dogs and their owners trying to control them plus the dog hair landing in food  It s just not my idea of a great time   We did opt to sit indoors the second time and service was so so  It was not overly busy  Why could we not get the mustard requested  Why didn t someone come back and see how we were doing  Refill on water  Nope  Mimosa with that Saturday brunch item  Nope  not even offered  Between these issues  dogs   service  and adding in uninspired food  standard bread on the breakfast sandwich  ingredients not evenly dispersed  overdone burger   we just don t see the need to return ,2,2016-05-29
Great food  huge selection of craft beers  and friendly staff   You can come here with your buddies or your family  it suits all   A lot of fun activities to do outside like beans bags   Also dog friendly  which is pretty neat ,5,2017-03-03
Came here a couple nights ago  our server was ok  Nothing out of the norm  it was a bit late in the night as we both had gotten off work  There s a different feel here than the Indian School location  Not sure if that s good or bad  We had a good time either way  There were plenty of games available and a solid selection of beer  Ordered a burger and some tacos  Tacos are build your own but they mix the coleslaw in with the meat which was odd  If I were to suggest anything I d change out the tore up water logged menus and I d organize more of the gaming area  just seemed cluttered   All in all we like coming here for late night bites and a quick brew ,3,2015-06-10
GREAT FOOD     Today was a special day for my husband and I for   reasons  First it is of course Valentines day and second it is the day my husband proposed to me    A dear friend of oura has been raving about Ohso s and because to day was special we decided to have our dinner there    The wait staff was awesome  They are so friendly and accomadating  They were of course very busy so we understood the stress they must have been under  They handled it with grace and poise   The food was amazing  The problem is we had to wait a very long time to get it  Again we understood with it being Valentines Day that patience would be required  Not a problem  I did ask why such a long wait since it took nearly and hour and a half for our dinner  That was when I found out that there were only   cooks for night like tonight  THREE     REALLY   I m not sure how many cooks they have on a normal night  however one would think that on holidays they would be over staffed  My heart goes out to the cooks that were there because they were packed  The food was definately worth the wait  At least the cooks that were there knew what they were doing    We will definately be going back again when its not a holiday so we don t have to wait so long for our food    P S  A note to management  you should have more cooks on holidays  If it turns out to be slow you can always send someone home ,2,2016-02-15
Booked this place last minute for a work dinner and they accommodated us and handled our large  rowdy group so well  The food was outstanding  beer and cocktails were delicious and the outside area was perfect  Loved the different games they had available  Overall great experience and bonus  you can bring your dog so we got to see some adorable puppies too ,5,2018-06-10
My fianc  and I came here to eat and felt the service by our own server was terrible  She has everyone else doing her work for her  My Cobb salad tasted like all the components had been siting in a refrigerator for so long that they took on the flavor of the refrigerator  The ranch was bottled ranch  personally I think that s gross and my fianc  s Arizona burger was not that great  too much cream cheese  Also  he fries were cold  After an appetizer  entrees and   drinks  two each  we spent      Defiantly Not Worth that kind of money  Only plus and reason for   stars is the beer   And it wasn t even their own breweries beer it was from a different Arizona Brewer  Very disappointed,2,2015-12-14
Fun place but the food is always awful  Why can t they even make a decent burger and fries   Also  the wine choices are limited and way over priced  they offer half off bottles after    pm  seriously  who is st OHSO after    pm ,1,2018-03-05
This place is fun and unique  The service and food are excellent and the beer is fantastic  The outdoor seating is great and they allow dogs and even have an area specifically for them  which is awesome  Pricing is a bit on the high side  but still reasonable ,5,2016-03-08
Our waitress was inattentive  We had to ask her for multiple things several times  The food we did get was okay at best ,1,2018-12-25
too bad cause the food and beer were great  but service was awful  asked for a side of bleu cheese  for my buffalo chicken sandwich  the bartender said  we ll see what i can do      never came  which wasn t a huge deal then asked to close out multiple times while sitting at the bar before someone bringing me tab and took forever to run it while I was in hurry to get somewhere  again food drink pretty solid  but super slow  incompetent service,2,2018-08-19
This is a great place  The atmosphere  The wine  The bar is fun and the food is good bar food  The outdoors is entertaining and personally I think that out of the OhSo restaurants  this is the nicest to have a function or party ,5,2017-08-12
Cool place  Decent brunch menu  Mimosas were great but at     glass I feel they are   dollars over priced  Indoor area has     large TV s behind the bar  Service was average ,3,2016-01-18
The food is great but our night was bad because we sat on the patio near the ping pong tables   There was a little league team    the diamond backs that were out of control  I was hit   times by the balls and then hit with the rocks from the ground that one of the boys had sprinkled on the ping pong table  We told the waitress about it and thought she would have taken care of it but no  It took another patron that got hit several times by the ball to finally stop it  He kept the ball that hit him and that s finally when the waitresses got involved  management needs to handle things like this better  I don t live here and was visiting but this made me not ever want to come back and I would never recommend this place ,4,2018-06-14
I had an excellent time here on Friday night  Despite how busy it was  our server  Gabby  was incredibly patient and friendly with our rowdy table  Her positive attitude was a refreshing experience  It s hard to find really good customer service  but we found it tonight at OHSO with Gabby ,5,2017-04-15
Every time I go here  I received excellent service with a smile  One of my pet peeves is people in the service industry who are unpleasant  and I have never had a negative interaction with anyone who works here     The food is wonderful  as well  Everything is light and refreshing  and it all taste wonderful ,5,2018-07-12
Let s Be Honest  Great place to Go and Chill with a Drink if you have some time to hang out    but IF you re looking for a quick bite to eat and get on the road  look elsewhere   It is a   Star experience if you know how to enjoy the place  but it is a bit slow with Service at times   It is a Great Atmosphere  Dog Friendly and very accommodating  homemade treats  leash clips at tables  and bowls they keep on hand just for dog water   and of course a Good Menu   Fresh salads  good Burgers and Sandwiches  nice Apps  and a Huge Microbrew Beer List     The patio is set up for Year around entertainment  with games  heaters  plenty of shade  and mist systems cooling fans   The ONLY downside is that it is as Popular as it sounds  so the wait list can be long any evening or weekend  and the Service Sometimes lags as a result   That s not a big deal  IF you re there to Chill     While waiting for a table  there are essentially  cocktail  servers walking around to try to accomodate the game and extra seating areas  plus the Bars have areas for walk up service  designed so you don t block service wells   Order drinks before they re empty  to counteract sometimes lagging service times  and have a great time   ,4,2016-04-06
My dog rates this place a   star  I rate it a   for an average of   star rating  Service is a bit slow food is pricey atmosphere is great   Kids should have a curfew in the patio area     Great go to place for a beer or two and to socialize the dogs ,4,2015-03-24
Good fries  and the red headed server  Linda is hot  although she never brought me my side of bbq sauce  Great atmosphere  great beer  good service ,5,2015-10-25
I was visiting my sister in law and her family  and she took us here on our first night  Perfect spot for good beers and tasty food  The backyard patio area was full of dogs  even had homemade doggy treats to take home or give to your doggo there   and had misters so it was quite cool even though it was close to     degrees that evening    Our service was quick and attentive  and our waitress even changed one of the channels to the Yankees vs  Red Sox game    I LOVED my turkey burger  It had this delicious fresh fruit compote jam and topped off with crispy bacon  Probably one of the best turkey burgers I ve had in awhile    The only con would be the noise level  Not sure if this can be controlled since we are in an outdoor area with people drinking  dogs  and families  It was somewhat difficult hearing someone on the other side of the booth ,4,2018-05-17
It s one of my local favorites  Get the Orange Blossom brew with your breakfast and take the pooches  Love brunch and the funky hippster vibe   its not annoying but a refreshing ambiance    Imagine  if you will  a happy convergence of humanity of all generations watching sports  watching dogs and watching each other with a pleasant buzz and a full belly    Food is surprisingly good by the way  Stay far away from the Paradise Valley location  I don t want it to get too busy ,5,2019-07-30
Great place    Brunch is the bomb food and drink always good  this place is huge  they started the luau all you can eat for      patio is greet and they have music today love this place,5,2015-04-12
Best brunch in town  Have a dog  s  no problem  big group  No problem  children or a large group  No problem  The menu has amazing variety and quality food  and the mimosas are crazy big  Definitely a great place to hang out and have a drink ,4,2016-10-16
Brunch menu on the weekends is awesome  The biscuits and beer gravy was usually the go to  until they brought the hot chicken with biscuits and gravy  Love the fact there are pups all the time and ping pong  bags and other activities to do while waiting for food ,5,2019-11-17
The service was slow   Because of that  we ate and drank far less then we would have  The fries were very salty but still good  Would ask for less salt  The toasted cheese sandwich had a marmalade and other things on it and none of us could finish it  I would have preferred it plain because I didn t like the flavor  The pretzel board was pretty good  I probably won t be back unless someone else chooses the place  I might have been there on a bad night and perhaps the service would be better next time  Also the patio was miserably hot and there was no way to get cool  Very difficult to get a drink or refill ,3,2015-08-10
I have been wanting to try this place out for some time but I did not find myself nearby at lunch time  So finally I get there right as they open at    and get seated on the patio right away  My server quickly took my order for an iced tea and brought it back and I hadn t figured out what I wanted yet  At that point he told me the wait staff was shifting assignments so he would be waiting waiting both occupied tables inside and the waitress on duty would be taking the two occupied tables outside  including mine  I never did see her  After    minutes I waived the waiter down as he interacted with the hostess  As soon as he got close to my table he realized I had been ignored  From that point on my service was bend over excellent  My iced tea was comped and he insisted on sending me off with another in a to go cup    I try to keep my red meat consumption to a minimum but the burgers all sounded so good I had to try one  the Burger   Cheese and I upped my side from fries to a salad  The salad was good and the burger was really good   Overall I would not let the server mix up stop me from coming again ,3,2019-02-04
Great atmosphere and BIG  Biggest dog friendly patio I ve been to    Try the local vodka      Tons of TVs and plenty of patio games to entertain while waiting for your order    Staff and menu is over the top  Friendly and fast service   localbeer  bar  tacos  ohso  patio  dogfriendly,5,2019-04-13
The server came to take out order  We told him what we wanted  He said  that contains bacon   I said  I know   I asked why he told me that  He said he was  required to   I asked why  He said with a wink that it was  in case you were vegan  I said  it s listed in the ingredients why would you HAVE to tell me     No response  In other words it was in case I was Islamic  What the hell is wrong with you guys  Are you now PC warriors  What if I had a religious objection to onions  Would you require servers to tell patrons each time onions were in the meal even if it was a listed ingredient  Can t Muslims read the ingredients  Can t vegans read the ingredients  If they were in doubt isn t their responsibility to ASK  What happened to personal responsibility  PC pandering is BS  I am so disappointed in OHSO  We used to go there a lot ,1,2017-06-15
Walked into a cloud of mist and WOW  I m surrounded by dogs  great burgers and refreshing cocktails  it s like eating in paradise  ,5,2019-06-03
I am absolutely in love with this spot  So much fun  Kid friendly   dog friendly   booze hound friendly   The happy hour specials are amazing  The outside patio is huge   it has ping pong   corn hole   ample seating   dog water troughs   It s bright   open   airy   colorful   The huge outside fans keep you cool while you enjoy the sunny weather  Great whiskey selection   some great white wines by the glass   I had the asparagus with cotija cheese   a simple salad with citrus vinaigrette   Can t wait to try this spot when I m not dieting  This is definitely worth a try   you won t be disappointed  ,5,2015-10-29
Great experience here  I love the outside patio  Some of the dogs were barking a lot here but that s just part of the scene since they sure dogs in the outside patio section  I ordered the turkey burger and it was huge  Almost thought I wasn t gonna be able to finish it  Service was great  everyone very friendly and they got dog biscuits    I ll definitely be back fo sure ,5,2019-04-21
Went here with my brother on a Thursday night   We ordered the brisket sandwich and beef shortribs   The brisket sandwich had a very strong bbq sauce flavor   The brisket itself had a good flavor   The jalapeno polenta was very good   My brother had the beef short ribs   We were expecting a full rack of ribs for     but when it came it just a small heap of meat   We asked the bartender and the person who brought it out and they confirmed it is indeed the beef short rib plate   The beef short rib didn t taste like ribs at all   In fact  it tasted like brisket and was very pricey   We both had gas a few hours after eating here   And in fact  we both had gas all through the next day   I had diarrhea from this and felt better after I went to the bathroom   I went on a date a year ago and had the same experience with food poisoning   While the food tasted good  we both felt sick the next day from eating here   No food quality control here   I was reluctant to write a negative review but this seems to be a regular occurrence here   Was afraid to come here after that bad experience   And now the second time I am here  the same thing ,1,2017-02-04
Great place to come  get some work done  eat great food and enjoy the embience   Staff was amazing,5,2019-05-04
My sisters and I had brunch there Sunday and it was delicious  It was crazy with the dogs  the large amount of people and the loud music  but it was worth it ,5,2019-04-03
Our Family calls this place Church  As you will find us there every Sunday between     am  Penny mimosa  ask for more flavors  with brunch is always welcome  As much as I love the chicken and waffles  sometimes I sacrifice that mimosa for my favorite meal of all the  the brisket  It s not a date food  but you surly won t be disappointed  Brunch or lunch this place is straight up gold  Plus a million different breeds of dogs  It s like a dog zoo  even with attentive clean up staff  It s a must in the valley ,5,2019-04-28
So I m vegetarian with a lot of food allergies  prior to coming to OHSO I looked at the food menu to ensure there was something on the brunch menu that I was able to eat  I found they had a special vegan and gluten free menu  yay     and when I arrived I asked for this menu specifically  After asking for this special menu  I ordered and bowl of Guac for my party to share  No I didnt look at the menu  I just ordered guac     like a normal person would  expecting it to be avocado  lime  cilantro  etc  Well it came and I enjoyed a few bites before I noticed there was BACON in the guacamole  I ve never heard of such a thing and am VERY upset that I wasnt told there was bacon in it  after asking for the vegan menu  I figured it was obvious that might be something I need to know  So no  I didnt look at the menu before I order the guac which is my fault  but I ve served many years and I know that you need to inform your table if something  different  is in an item  ESPECIALLY IF THEY ASK FOR A VEGAN MENU   Ugh Im just so sad I ate a piggy when this could have been avoided     I just hope their servers are more aware when serving people things  it could ve been something I was allergic to   On the plus side  the make their Monster Mimosas strong AF  I ll come back just for that ,2,2019-01-13
This place is easily becoming one of my favorite places in the Valley  I have to admit  The first time I came to this OHSO I was with some really crapy company  So I didn t think much of the place at all  When my husband insisted I give this place another chance  I was hesitant  Boy am I glad that I did though  The only thing I had that night was a few of their beers  and the out of the world  Steak Fries  Skirt Steak  Garlic Fries  Cotija  Micro Greens  Poblano Aioli  I wanted to take a gallon of the Poblano Aioli and put it on everything  This was going to be an appetizer for my Husband and I  Turned out its more like a meal to share  We were so full  I discovered that night I really enjoyed the vibe of this brewery  Very relaxed  open  with fun games  and people with their dogs  families  and friends  This place is for everyone    After glancing at their Brunch menu we knew we had to back and bring the pup  The next week we got the pup ready  headed out and got to OHSO about     There were dog s everywhere  It was wonderful  Our pup was in doggy heaven  He was given organic treats  his own water dish  and PLENTY of attention from not only the staff  but other patrons and pups  We got   of the Beer Brunch specials  I got the Fred s French Toast  Thick cut Toast Covered in Fruity Pebbles  Lemon Mascarpone  Fresh Berries  with Bacon  Yea that s right  COVERED IN FRUITY PEBBLES  I would say it was too much for me to finish myself  But it was delicious  I had a Mimosa with my breakfast  It was part of the Beer and Brunch special     Bucks  So worth it  The Mimosa s are HUGE  I hate when you order a mimosa and they give you some kind of BABY champagne glass    We went back a week later and I decided to have something more savory from the Brunch Menu and their Coffee Beer from their Beer and Brunch menu     Bucks this time  I had the Avocado Toast  It was very good  The first time I had ever had Ezequiel bread  The egg was perfectly cooked  nice and yoke y without being undercooked  The Coffee beer was perfection  Tasted just like coffee  If you have ever thought beer might be weird for breakfast  Not anymore  And it wasn t a Stout Coffee Beer  It was more like an Ale  I highly recommend giving it a try    Anywho    This place is the best with its mostly outside  dog friendly  huge patio with tons of games  and places to park your butt  It s meant to get you talking and having fun  For me  the only negative for me is that it s so far away from where I live  I wish my side of town had and OHSO  Maybe someday  Until then I will continue to make the drive  It s well worth it ,5,2016-06-15
Great place to go and there s a lot of activity at this location because it the biggest of the    On a Saturday night we didn t have long to wait for dinner maybe    minutes  and it was filled with playing a game of corn hole while watching kids play ping pong and dogs enjoying the dog friendly patio  BTW  I was the corn hole champion    Our Waiter was great and knew a lot about the menu  I had the chicken and waffles  which is the best I ve ever had  The bacon is absolutely amazing with this dish  The burgers come in a warm cast iron skillet  which is great for keeping your french fries or sweet potato fries warm Not an intimate atmosphere for dinner for    but if you like a lot of activities going on and big screen TV s this is a great place to come    Sorry there are no pictures of our food  we were too busy eating to get one  I can t wait to come back and try some other dishes ,5,2018-04-15
Always delicious love he spicy biscuits and gravy    Great seating  inside and out  Gloria is the best ,4,2018-01-09
I love OHSO   This location is my favorite  Such a fun place to go with friends or even as a family  The food and drinks here are amazing too  One of my favorite places here in Scottsdale ,4,2018-09-16
I don t even know where to start  His place is fantastic  Family environment yet fresh brewed beer  Love love,5,2015-04-05
So we have been big fans of the original OHSO  arcadia  for about   years now and when the PV location opened I was crazy excited since it was about a    min drive rather than the       to the original   We have gone to the PV OHSO about       times and it just seems like each time we go the food has just gone down in quality   I would say maybe it is just what we are ordering but we have tried different items and same holds true with each dish   Just VERY BLAN no flavor at all   Hate to say it but I think my days of OHSO PV are at a close   Too bad because I really do like the location and how dog friendly they are ,2,2016-08-08
Really fun environment  The food was awesome and our waitress was very friendly  Would love to come back here ,5,2019-03-10
This review addresses happy hour  not regular dining and drinking   The guys like our happy hour   Good beer and excellent small bites at a reasonable price   OHSO is SOSO   Their beer earns five stars   You can t go wrong with their brews as well as other choices   The    small bites were microscopic and not very good   The guys were displeased   More like a sad hour   Also  way too noisy    What do guests want to do   Listen to noise or have conversation  Duh ,3,2016-02-07
Really love all the OHSO s  this one is probably the largest  I must say I almost gave  stars because it was overloaded with at least    small kids at happy hour  but they are kid and dog friendly  so I can t fault that  The service is amazing here  Katie was our server and she must have checked in on us over ten times  Very satisfied        The food is always great  the little crostini was so delicious  must have been the butter  but they paired really nice with the hummus and egg dip  The pretzels always come out perfect  I absolutely love the OHSO brew called Boom  Dynamite with mango   grapefruit notes  It s delicious  Next time I have to try Sonic Boom  I think there beer selection is better than most expectations  Will be back soon ,5,2018-04-27
The atmosphere is great with lawn games and a huge patio  Little bit of a pain to reserve a table for a large group     people   Food is always good and beer selection is great,4,2017-06-04
Great beer and great food  Nothing to complain about   Service has been exceptional whenever I ve been there  as well    They also have a very good brunch on weekends   I can t wait to go back ,5,2015-07-29
My favorite spot for drinks  happy hour  or just a good beer w friends   Love the various IPAs always on tap  food is great  brunch is delicious  and the staff are seriously the best    We go almost weekly and will definitely continue to go     Got some more pics when I was there last night    Donated     of profits to Hurricane Harvey,5,2017-08-07
Went there during happy hour and its a good spot with outdoor seating  ping pong tables and corn hole    The OHSO Hoppy was good    to where we had   pitchers  The Gobbler was one of the better turkey burgers I ve had  The side of the jalepeno polenta  was ok   it was a cross between mash potatoes and grits     nd  The salmon BLT and the Pilgrim turkey sandwich are both really good  The salmon can be a little dry but having extra lemon dill aioli on the side helps    The caramel apple pie is really good  its bad for u  but tastes really good ,4,2017-10-01
The beer was good but I would not recommend the burger  I had the green chilie burger with a small side salad  The burger was awful  no flavor and stale dry bun  The salad was good  but not worth     for burger and tiny salad ,2,2018-10-18
OHSO is a great place for beers and pub food  but I recommend coming during non peak hours when the place is not overrun by screaming kids   At other times  it s a lot more relaxing with just the adults   For food  I really like the portobello sandwich because I can substitute the meat with turkey for a healthier option   I also like the Gobbler  which comes with turkey meat as the standard   My boyfriend prefers the grilled pork skillet   Besides OHSO s great variety of beers  I really like the white sangria   CHEERS ,4,2015-08-08
What a great place to spend an afternoon  Great food  don t get me started on the steak fries   and fantastic atmosphere  Games for everyone  plenty of room to wander around and sangria  so  perfect  ,5,2015-07-19
I like the brews and that it s dog friendly but I m pretty sure I won t eat here again   I have gotten sick the last two times ,2,2017-04-09
Finally a new  fun  place to grab a beer  PV really needed this  A great atmosphere for the whole family  A large variety of local brews and a tasty menu to pair it with  Well done O H S O    ,4,2015-05-05
We stopped in yesterday morning for brunch with our dog and had a great time   The patio is huge and completely pet friendly   huge bonus for our family   The service is friendly and efficient and the brunch is a great deal       for a meal and an AZ beer or mimosa   This location of OHSO will definitely be added to our regular rotation ,4,2016-12-12
Amazing brunch for Saturday and Sunday special      and that includes a mimosa or a   oz local beer  Love  Rest of the menu looked really good too  but I m a drinker and I couldn t get over the    pitcher deal  That was basically two and a half beers  But the happy hour starts from   am to  pm  HELLO   AWESOME   I ll be back for sure  I haven t been to the other locations but this one has an amazing patio  And for it being as hot as it is being outside wasn t as bad  they have a ton of misters and fans going around  Very fun place to be,5,2015-06-15
This location is even better than the one off Indian School  It s an open air restaurant  and the patio is huge  If you love dogs and beer  you will be in heaven  Came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and the place was packed  They told us it was going to be a    minute wait but I don t think we even had to wait for    minutes  My party was sat while I waited for a couple of pitchers of beer at the outdoor bar  Despite the high volume  bartenders were pretty efficient  Our server was super friendly  knew the menu well  and delivered food and drinks quickly  Went with the AZ Burger at his suggestions  and I ate every bite  Highlights include jalepeno cream cheese and crispy onion strings    Orange Pedal beer was a nice refreshing beer that is great on a warm afternoon on the patio  but the   Ale was a far superior choice  It s definitely the best selection if you re a true beer lover   Only downside is that there are children all over the place  Parents seem to think that a couple of cornhole   ping pong tables equal free babysitting ,5,2018-03-24
So much fun   The atmosphere was so fun  We loved the games and the way the place was set up  The food was delicious  I would definitely go back just to have their AZ Burger again  That was delicious  Totally recommend  If we go back again and have an awesome experience I will give   stars    ,4,2015-03-23
Very lively place with fun activities and dogs on the patio    Great customer service as well      I messed up my food order when ordering from the server and they were kind enough to remake my meal for me  I will definitely be back ,5,2015-04-14
I loved this bar restaurant when it first opened but I went back recently and the atmosphere has really gone down hill  The food was ok  The play area started out as an adult fun area but the more I go back  the more kids I see there outside  I love kids  don t get me wrong but it is a brewery  Also the lighting inside was way too bright for a bar  I felt like I was on stage with lights beaming down on me or like the bar was closing,3,2017-01-12
First time here  We liked the vibe and food was good  We both had burgers  sweet potato fries were yummy  The outside has bean bag toss  ping pong and other games  You can even bring your pooch  They have a     brunch on weekends that includes a drink  We re trying that next ,4,2015-09-11
Great place had a beer and some lunch   great setting staff was good   other than it being a big overpriced great place,4,2015-08-31
Love this place  You can select your own wines that you re used to or beers that you are used to or spirits that you are used to   Or be adventurous    Try theirs that they small craft them selves  You won t be disappointed  They are truly amazing  They distill the rum whiskey is the distilled around vodka as they distill their beers  they distill everything and they are beautiful  Their food is quite delicious  as well  I ve had their ahi appetizer plate  seared to perfection sliced Perfectly thin as it should be  They have a dish with macaroni and cheese and burnt ends and the bowl is huge   Then they had this other thing that I had never seen before was full of curds with crackers or soft crackers I have never seen that  before in my  life  I have to  say   if I didn t walk so much I would get really fat here  Lol  I want to try all the new things   Everything is so delicious ,5,2018-11-07
Cool concept  but I did not feel welcomed at all and felt neglected as a customer  I came late on friday night with my family and the hostesses said nothing to me  The one brought me to my table  put the menus down  I said  thank you   And she walked away without a word  Then  our waiter was friendly but it took an obnoxious amount of time to put in anything to order  My boyfriend said he had the same attitude from the hostesses  as did his mother and father ,2,2018-11-03
We had a great night  We had a big party with    crazy girls for food an drinks an Sam our server made it extra special  Our drinks were never empty our food an appetizers we great  Sam was awsome and when I come back I will for sure ask for him again   Thanks for making our holiday party special  All the recommendations were on point     Az burger all the way to the garlic cheese fries an the cheese curds are a must ,5,2018-12-06
This is the place to go for dog owners   The outdoor section is nice and big with a bar at the back for those long waits   Variety of craft beers  good happy hour  and a nice brunch with some pretty tasty chicken and waffles ,4,2017-01-16
We had a blast while enjoying a large group with reserved tables     Highly recommend going here ,4,2015-05-16
Breakfast  Brunch  lunch  dinner or just drinks you really can t go wrong   Love this location  well all the OHSO   The outside patio is amazing and the service is great  The drinks itself is worth the visit  Brunch by far is my favorite times to go  With any brunch purchase you get a free beer or mimosa  The mimosa mix is really champagne and a slash of OJ  Needless to say  one taste like you ve had three drinks  They also have a great beer menu  Overall just a great place to visit ,5,2017-10-29
Update  We had a great time last night and the atmosphere is cozy   friendly  The managers  Terry   Matt always make us feel welcome  The waiters   waitresses are the friendliest in town  Food is always tasty and hot  and the beer good   cold ,5,2016-02-04
Great food  great people  great atmosphere  Dog friendly doesn t even begin to describe it  Free dog treats and my dog loves playing in the fountains to keep cool,5,2015-10-10
Servers are Great  Food is awesome  I highly recommend this place for any time  Also dog friendly  Can t say one bad thing   ,5,2017-07-01
Bartender was rude and seemed like he only wanted to talk with a guy sitting at the bar  not sure if it was a friend or not  I asked for  a vodka and cranberry  i got a splash of cranberry with vodka  It was disgusting  Our DD ordered a Shirley temple  pretty simple right  nope  he hardly added any grenadine so it tasted like sprite but not quite like sprite ,1,2017-03-21
Brisket Mac and Cheese was ridiculously good   Love the turkey burger the pear compote was super yummy  Love the atmosphere and the games  Great place for kids and dogs   We would definitely come back  Just an FYI  came here on a Saturday and literally waited    minutes  We were able to get a seat at the bar so we didn t wait as long ,4,2015-05-20
We love OHSO and frequent the PV location often  This is just a cool place to relax and hangout Steak fries are awesome as are most every burger we ve ever tried  Bloody Mary with their Horseradish  Vodka is a must have ,5,2018-12-13
This is the preferred location over the one off Frank Lloyd Wright  The brunch is an excellent way to start your weekends  I personally am a fan of their burgers  They are cooked perfectly  juicy  and the bun is delicious  While I am not a huge fan of their brewed beers  I do like their selection of local beers and the happy hour pitcher prices ,4,2016-07-30
Can t go wrong with OSHO  I was in the area during dinner time and decided to stop in for a quick dinner before going home   Most reviewed food was brisket mac  so I ordered one  It had nice BBQ flavor  went well with macaroni and cheese  It s a bar food  so naturally after I started eating my food  I had to order just one local beer  smallest available  Oh the beer went well with the food so well  I quickly finished my dinner and became so full  I tasted sweet potato fries and they were good too   Service was excellent  Not just a server assigned to our table  other staff came by often asking if everything was okay   Good place to come to enjoy local craft beer with a group of people  They are pets and kids friendly here ,4,2017-01-05
So  a  cold  night out in Phoenix and we were looking for some dinner  We found this place  which was pretty cool  It seems to me that the Phoenix area has lots of the same   things   breweries  burgers  and Mexican food  Well   brewery it is   I had my toddler with me  so kid friendly was our theme  Luckily  this place was just that  A tabletop high chair     I was so excited to see one of those  I ve never seen such a tall chair before   Our server  Kevin  was extremely helpful  He talked to us about beer selections  and recommended several things to try  I had a few samples but I honestly can t remember names  I do know that they have lots of local brews there to try   I ordered the turkey burger and it was decent  Not outstanding  but it had bacon and bacon makes everything great    The buffalo cauliflower was really good too  We ended up ordering two rounds of that   I d stop in here again if in the area ,4,2019-11-09
OHSO has always been a good place to go for food and live music  the live music the main reason why I love to go here the band that plays here is so nice,5,2019-09-09
My co workers love OHSO  so we ve had a few happy hours here  There s a wide variety of drinks and food to choose from  Beers galore  and happy hour is quite the deal  I frequently order French fries because there have very few vegetarian options  I have mixed feelings about their veggie burger  The first time I had it  it was bland and too mushy  The second time I tried it  I was pleasantly surprised  It could have been because I was just pretty hungry  but it seemed a lot less mushy and a lot more delicious    could it be the lack of consistency in their kitchen or in my mind   I ll just have to try it again  I suppose    I ve also had their hummus plate plenty of times   again  consistency with flavoring   sometimes the hummus is quite good  sometimes it is meh  Their French fries though  always salty  but hits the right spot if that s how you like it   Friendly servers  friendly atmosphere  and oh so dog friendly  Amazingly dog friendly  They even have little carabiners to tie up your pup next to your booth   give you a water bowl when you first come in  and complimentary dog treats  It also seems to be very family friendly with lots of lawn games and such    This particular location is typically very busy   connected to a big parking lot which helps a lot  I usually leave OHSO pretty happy  so I ll continue coming here for sure          not the best place for vegetarians  They have the aforementioned burger and a few salads   but I m not one for ordering salads when I go out   ,4,2017-01-16
My dogs favorite place to hang out  Good food and good value  Love the Sunday brunch specials ,5,2016-10-11
What is there not to love about this place  This review is way overdue since my hubby and I frequent this place  Every time we are here we have a great time  but this past time takes the cake  The bartender was so friendly and actually seemed like she really loves her job  We were there yesterday        for Happy Hour  I ordered the popsicle blonde   I m talking beer not hair style  and my husband ordered the Orange Pedal  Insert Happy Hour upgrade to a pitcher for just a dollar more here    Damn it    The movie theater gets me with this every time and so did the bartender at OHSO  But  I m glad she did  let s be honest who only drinks one beer anyway   We also ordered the Jalapeno Cheese Curds and the Pretzels with Cheese sauce  Nom  Nom  Nom    Oh my lordy they serve the Cheese Curds with Brown Gravy    Make shift Poutine anyone  YES PLEASE  And just for S Gs I also dipped the Cheese Curds in the Cheese Sauce from the Pretzel  Mind Blown    All in all for   pitchers of beer  an order of Cheese Curds and the pretzels  our bill was just over      You can t beat that anywhere  The service was top notch and we will definitely be back soon ,4,2018-11-10
We arrived hot and thirsty but didn t stay long  Beer wasn t very cold and glasses were warm  What a disappointing experience ,1,2019-03-21
Rude Service We ve been to this location several times and the service is hit or miss  One day it s wonderful  the next not   Unfortunately this last time was the worst  Our bartender was incredibly rude  You could tell she really didn t want to be there and it made our experience less than enjoyable  It wasn t only her  The other bartender was just the same  Not sure what was up that day  Lots of attitude  When I asked questions questions re menu items she responded with  um  I m not sure  and  I don t know   Didn t try to check or find out answers to my questions  Just gave me a blank  bothered stare   So we ended up ordering the cheese board as an appetizer   now how can a cheese board be bad    Well it was  Way too skimpy and dried out  Not worth      A Lunchables would have been better   Usually the food is the best thing about the place  Due to the rudeness  attitude  lack of customer service and bad app  we skipped ordering dinner and more drinks    Although we love to see the dogs and overall atmosphere has a fun vibe we don t plan on going back to this location ,2,2019-06-20
My wife and I had a very nice lunch but thought the prices were too high  I had a turkey club on croissant and my wife had a cobb salad  The salad had a nice mixture of fresh greens and my sandwich was fresh and tasty  The concept of restaurant is geared towards a family friendly atmosphere where kids can play ping pong and it also encourages those to bring their fur babies  They do have some good happy hour prices but once again their regular prices are kind of on the high side ,4,2018-03-27
Pitchers of beer during Happy Hour are     which is a good deal as they are about   pints  As a vegetarian  I loved that I could sub a veggie burger for any of the burger options on the menu  We tried the AZ burger and loved it  it was so big  we could have split it ,4,2019-07-26
Great menu especially happy hour   lots of good eats and drink  Service very friendly and attentive   games too and it s dog friendly ,5,2019-08-17
My wife and I dined here for the very first time on Sunday afternoon  Parking lot is very tight and difficult to find an entrance when heading in from the west  traveling east  on Shea  A couple of U turns later  and a few near collisions with cars coming and going in the narrow drive lanes of the lot  and we found a spot   There was a    minute wait at      in the afternoon on a Sunday  Weird since they have a brunch special in the morning and a dinner luau special in the evening    We love that it is dog friendly   We got seated almost precisely    minutes after we arrived  as predicted by the staff   I decided to try the chicken and waffles  I am a big fan of LoLo s for this particular dish  but I try to keep an open mind   Glad I did  Unlike any other chicken and waffles dish offered  OHSO gives you two boneless  breaded chicken breasts  The best part of the chicken  in my opinion  and no bones or fat to work around   They also give you   Belgian style waffles  one too many  in my opinion  along with about a half dozen pieces of thick sliced  crispy maple bacon   There is a ramekin of maple flavored butter  as well as a ramekin of maple syrup in addition to the maple syrup lightly added to the dish   I ate everything  except one waffle   too filling    The server we had was impeccable  You simply could not ask for the server to do a better job  She was attentive  brought me a new Coke just as my anxiety kicked in as the one had was starting to run low  it was like she could read my mind   Orders were taken without error  We never had to wait and wonder where our server disappeared  She checked in on us often  but not too often   Our servers name was TiffanyL        and she was just amazing   Be sure to check out the restrooms at this place  They are very unique  Also  pay attention to the light fixtures over the tables  They are made from bicycle parts   My wife ordered the Carne Asada Taco and the     Orange pedal draft  She enjoyed both   Our total was        after tax  I think that s a fair price for what we got  We will definitely be coming back and bringing visitors from out of town here  No idea why we waited so long  although driving from Glendale  there is no freeway or  quick  way to get to any of their locations  If they opened one on the west side  I would eat there more often  Driving Bethany Home from   rd Ave to the     then the    to Shea  then Shea to Tatum  takes about       minutes depending on if you catch red lights and traffic  construction and accidents    Still  totally worth it   OHSO GOOD ,5,2018-04-23
Great place after a hike   Food and drinks are tasty   Great atmosphere with cute dogs ,5,2018-11-25
Nice indoor outdoor casual atmosphere but food was just average  Service was average ,3,2016-09-23
Great ambiance and dog friendly  They care for dogs by bringing out water or milk  if you request it   WARNING  Nasty  overpriced food  They re known for their beverages but I don t drink  They have ping pong tables  tv s  hackey sack games and patios  We just come here to hang out with the dogs and have a good time  You can wear a cute dress or casual jeans and you ll be fine ,3,2016-10-26
First time in OHSO s and I tried the Chicken and Waffles   I was super excited bc i have had some amazing C W before in my lifetime   Granted  I had high expectations coming from Portland  OR where The Screen Door had to die for C W  if you re ever in Portland this place is a MUST try    But when my dish came out  disappointment was oozing from my face     The chicken was such a small portion and comparable to what you would get in a Hungry Man tv dinner  and the waffle wasn t even a whole waffle      ths of a waffle  I mean really    To make it even worse  it was one of the more expensive dishes on their menu   In OHSO s defense  I have heard their other food is good  and what my friend ordered looked much more appetizing   Also  the wait staff was very nice and did offer to make something else  but being the type that does not like to waste food  I stomached half the meal and gave the other half to my friend to take home who never ate the leftovers   I plan on trying this place again  but I would highly recommend steering clear of the classic Chicken and Waffles ,2,2017-08-24
OHSO is one of my absolute favorite places to go to  Great food great beer great service and great atmosphere  I have eaten here many times and I ve never had a bad meal ,5,2017-05-17
We probably get takeout from OHSO at least once a week   Wonderful food   Wonderful service ,5,2018-07-07
I came here tonight with my dog and my boyfriend  We sat outside and the staff was quick to bring my dog water and dog biscuits  The service was great  the food was AMAZING  I would recommend the steak and fries  it was so good  Will be returning ,5,2017-03-10
This place was ok  I didn t care for all the animals blocking the walking path  Food was ok  Had some sort of cheesy fries,3,2017-06-25
What a great atmosphere   GREAT  happy hour and starters    Had steak and fries    Chopped skirt steak amongst skinny fries soaked in a poblano aoili   Ask for  Steve    A helpful   learned waiter who can answer any question you may have ,4,2015-09-16
Great amount of room at this location  Same great beers and food here as well   Although the happy hour food menu is a little lacking  everything else is great  Weekend brunch is tasty and a good deal       that includes a beer or mimosa   When the weather permits  Sundays there is live music on the patio as well ,4,2015-06-27
This newest location is by far my favorite setup  I say this as a girl with a well behaved pup  a curious toddler  and a penchant for chill fun   You enter the restaurant via the outdoor patio  where you see high top booths with dog leashes attached to the carabiners provided  Then it opens out to low firepit tables with couch seating  flanked with game areas  Ping pong tables and giant labyrinths on one side    corn hole sets and foosball tables on the other  with a cute grassy area for the pets  as well as a hidden hand washing station  though currently not working  behind  It s a great setup  Open and welcoming with a fantastic ambiance  Their bar is has plenty of seating and TVs  And that bar makes a killer Moscow mule  Happy hour is THE time to come for cheap small pitchers of great local beers   On opening day  we saw scads of dogs happily sitting at the feet of their owners  getting free OHSO dog treats  Didn t love seeing the dogs sitting on the couch seating  however  This is still a restaurant  guys  and those are some big dogs  But my kelpie was excited to sniff all the new pup butts and even tried out that grassy spot in back    My second visit was with kid in tow  Let me tell you  we made it through two and a half hours here with flying colors  Plenty of space to wander around  things to pick up  dogs to watch  and tiny little kid plastic chairs to stack and move  Inside  there are some non bar height booths next to the window that we were eventually seated at with a high chair where he enjoyed his tiny little cheeseburger  which was nice    Speaking of the food  it s pretty good  The crab dip and the devilish egg dip are tasty  but they re really very small  The shrimp tacos needed an extra kick to be memorable and my Ensalada del Sol was lacking in dressing and the corn salsa  But those burgers  AZ Burger or Arcadia Veggie Burger are where it s at  I d eat those all day long  And the Brisket   Mac was incredible  The  adult  strawberry and mango sorbet is perfectly refreshing to finish off a hot night   The location is perfect for us and I can t wait to come back  but I really do hate the parking situation during happy hour  The bartenders look a bit over worked and thus weren t very friendly to those of us grabbing a drink to go play games on the patio  We were also noticing that the patio has no REAL cover for when the summer hits  Hopefully they ve got a plan for shade  But our service was generally good and  overall  I love all that they have to offer here  Cheers ,5,2015-03-23
Unbelievable atmosphere  ambiance and music every single time we come here   You just can t help but drink more when coming here  especially with friends   Great drinks  appetizers and service   We love this place ,4,2015-08-03
Good for dogs  not so good for humans  Waited for    minutes for a table  understandable on a Sunday   When I went to check on the wait list  I found out that the hostess never actually put our name in  When we were finally seated  we had the pleasure of waiting another    minutes before a server even came to the table to bring water    It does look like the tables around us have been served well ,1,2015-03-22
Great location   wonderful atmosphere   no worries about noise factor as there is outside eating available   dogs welcome  corn hole and ping pong   reasonable prices for happy hour  area has been long time waiting for this brewery,5,2017-10-18
Huge fan of OHSO Arcadia  Thought I d give the new Tatum Shea location a try and have to say it was a little disappointing  For someone who wants to head to a brewery and have some adult fun and relax after work   this is NOT the place  On both sides of us was the latest brewery daycare of PV   Don t even think about trying to play cornhole   the court was overrun with kids digging in the dirt and throwing rocks  one actually hitting our table  to the other side were even more kids banging on the metal ping pong tables with their paddles and knocking over umbrellas  Needless to say when the server came back to ask if we wanted another beer   we were like check please ,2,2015-06-19
Neat joint to sit and people watch  The food is adequate  nothing particularly stood out  but the drinks were better than average  People can bring their dogs and children   there were plenty of both on a Friday evening  The kids can have fun with the   corn hole toss sets    ping pong tables  or   oversized marble maze tables  The servers and bartenders were good   attentive  and if the food was a little better I d be looking for a house in that neighborhood  From the descriptions in the menu I expected an explosion of flavors from my burger  I was a bit underwhelmed  as were the people I was with who ordered shrimp tacos  a salmon BLT  blackened salmon   turkey sandwich  Nothing really stood out  other than the atmosphere of the entire place ,4,2016-04-03
This is a awesome ohso  Went here for the first time last week to grab a beer with friends and they have a really cool patio and outside bar   There was live music who were actually really good and not too loud   Food is great and so are the beers ,5,2017-04-13
Got here at      with   adults and   kids  They told us       mins  An hour into it they told us we were  next   Not seated until an   hour    mins  Good thing we had some beers  Upon initial arrival there were a number of long high tops available but were told those were for parties of     A number of drinking groups that came after us were seated way before us  Server was very nice  Food was ok  I wouldn t come with a family ,2,2018-03-24
Came here for Sunday Brunch with a few friends  It is definitely a popular spot so make sure to get there early and grab a table   I love that OHSO is dog friendly   they provide individual water bowls   free homemade doggie treats  Because both my friends had dogs with them  we sat under the covered patio area   Their Sunday Brunch special is amazing  A brunch item and local AZ beer for      I opted for the biscuits   beer gravy with Blackberry wheat beer  The biscuits   gravy was good  I think just the right amount of good  I really liked the gravy on top  it had a good kick to it  Then also topped it with nice crunchy  smoky  bacon   cant go wrong there  I also ordered a side of sunny side eggs to go with    they were nicely cooked  The blackberry beer definitely had a floral hint to it  The next one I tried was the strawberry blonde which I liked a lot more  Definitely had the fruity flavor to it  but not too overbearing   Service was a little slow  but I understand its a busy Sunday  so it didnt bother me too much   This location also has a HUGE patio compared to ther others  so I would probably prefer this location ,4,2017-03-19
My husband and I stopped in for dinner  I had the Gobbler Turkey Burger which was very enjoyable  My husband got the pastrami sand which which had a little zip  We enjoyed the OHSO beer flight and whiskey flight  Lots of interesting flavors  The vibe was good without being too loud or crazy  Our waiter Chris was attentive and knowledgeable  Would definitely recommend for a casual dinner or to watch a game ,5,2017-10-05
If I just came here to drink with friends and didn t care about eating or using a functioning bathroom  this would be a   star review     stars for location  parking availability  huge interior  cool patio  friendliness of staff  and beer list     stars for having a vegan menu     star for serving the Italian Farm Salad on the vegan menu with parmesan and telling me it s vegan      star for bringing a new vegan Italian Farm Salad without parmesan  but with cured pork product hidden deep inside mixed in with the lettuce     stars for the vegan Italian Farm Salad  minus the  accidental  parmesan and pork  because even though the dressing had good flavor and the lettuce was fresh and good  there were very few of the other ingredients listed  Ingredients  couscous  quinoa  artichoke  heirloom cherry tomato  roasted red pepper  apple  vinagrette   If the salad had more couscous  or any quinoa at all  it would be more filling  But it wasn t  It was a plate of lettuce saturated in dressing ,3,2016-07-10
Love the new location  Great environment  Lots to do here if you are drinking wanderer  Still good food  Can t wait till they start brewing their own beer ,5,2015-03-13
It s trying to be The Yard  And The Yard sucks   The only saving grace is the food is not bad   unlike the service  which is terrible ,2,2015-03-26
Service is great here  food is great  drinks are awesome  But  the management is horrible  I have watched managers  Terry  let people get so wasted they can t stand up are and stealing other guests drinks  I ve watched food go to one guest and when the server realized it was the wrong table took the plate that was already eaten off of to the right guest  Seriously  there are liquor laws and health standards  I m also friends with an employee and heard that someone just got fired for utilizing a legal open door policy with the owner against the manager who in turn fired her  Unbelievable  They re lucky the BBB doesn t hear about it ,3,2016-09-07
Great Great beers with a very narrow limited food selection  If you re to try and taste some new order full beers with food an afterthought  this is your place  Fun setting  good service ,4,2016-02-17
This is my first time at any OHSO  I was very impressed with the layout of this establishment  It is so customer friendly with open spaces for people to walk around and hang  I love that this place is dog friendly  They even give a water bowl to your pet with their name on the bowl  Amazing     I came here with a large group and the staff worked very hard to make sure everyone received their drinks quickly  There was a bit of confusion with passing out the drinks to the wrong people because different staff was passing them out  but our actual server made it right    The pork wings were very good  I would have those again as a meal  One thing to remember is that this place brews their own beer so you can t order a Budlight  You get something similar to it  This also goes for their different shots    If you want to play fun outdoor games come here  They can corn hole and ping pong  This is definitely a fun hang out spot for you and your friends ,5,2018-05-27
Went here with friends for Beer and Donuts  I showed up a little late  I waited I think about    minutes before a server came by  It actually wasn t our server that took the order  just one of the staff clearing off empty plates  We had asked for someone to send our server over already at this point  One of my friends got there about   minutes before me and she hadn t been helped either    The beer and donuts were great  It took a really long time to get a pitcher of beer  I ordered it before the food arrived and we were done eating before it arrived  The sandwich was kind of bland  the beer was very good   I will try this place again  I d like to go for happy hour sometime  Hopefully I can update this review with a better rating ,3,2019-02-08
Really cool  happening  dog friendly atmosphere but food is not that good at all and the place smells like a burger s king kitchen  and so do your clothes and hair when you leave ,2,2019-03-15
Nasty Place  Were there Saturday and they were hosting a free tasting on the patio but our waitress never bothered to tell us  Our patio table was so sticky that my napkin got stuck to it   There was hair in both the salad dressing and stuck to the sweet potato fries and because they allow dogs they need to be more sanitary  This place smells so bad and unclean  Don t take your family there especially children  no telling what germs they will bring home ,1,2017-07-17
I just paid     for two vodka diet cokes at lunch  I m sorry but that is outrageous pricing       for a specialty drink at a trendy nightclub in old town on a Friday night  sure      for a vodka Diet Coke over lunch at Tatum   Shea  NEVER AGAIN  ,1,2015-10-05
The first time I went to OHSO it was a different location and I was disappointed with the service  I have now been to this location   times and have had a great experience each time  Great service  not bad drink prices  cool environment  My husband really loves on of the beers they brew here  one of his all time favorite beers  However  their food menu is a bit pricey and we weren t wow ed by the tacos and salad each of us got  We won t be eating here for full meals  just drinks or apps ,4,2017-10-09
I like this location better than the one at the     and frank lloyd wright  The service was great  and we were a big party of       people  The food was excellent  I got a bacon cheeseburger with a side salad and blue cheese dressing  I would definitely come to this location again  Also  we sat outside  and even though it was hot outside  it was shaded enough that we didn t feel the heat much at all ,5,2017-06-30
So  this is an official check in and update to my original review    The PV location is a different vibe from the others  and a lot of the clientele seem to be folks who are now parents  but still want to feel like they have a social life  I get it    Having said that  those that are seeking a kid lite atmosphere might be happiest here on Sunday afternoons  when the kid adult ratio is a little lower  On our third visit  we found that Sunday afternoon is our sweet spot    I d like to give props to our server Gage who was awesome    He was very knowledgeable about the menu  and was able to make great recommendations  He was also genuinely friendly  attentive and on tops of things    That food was great  and the beer was cold  Couldn t ask for a better experience   ,5,2015-08-09
This is my favorite place in the valley  I love the food  it s absolutely delicious  I love the Cobb salad and the AZ burger the most  The atmosphere here is awesome  family friendly  dog friendly  just all around friendly and positive vibes   Oh  and the brunch is amazing   ,5,2017-01-09
I ve been here several times over the last few months with both large and small groups  and the service is always wonderful   I love the environment  the beer selection  and most of the menu   The only improvement would be expanding the food menu just a little bit   For someone who frequents the restaurant often  I would love a wider variety to choose from ,4,2015-07-10
I spent a Sunday afternoon enjoying my perch under a shady tree   The layout and set up of this O H S O is fantastic  Just what that neighborhood needed  Very four legged friendly with a open area in the back where dogs can drink water and do their  business if necessary    The service was lacking in the back area so waited on drinks and spent time trying to flag down a waitress   Way to many unattended children   A reminder that its an establishment not a play ground  ,4,2015-05-19
Love this place    dog friendly  great atmosphere and I enjoy the text option when your table is ready  The steak fries are awesome ,5,2016-02-27
Great new spot   Saw the sign and stopped in for a snack   Was pleasantly surprised   Beer on tap from local brewerys plus a few of their own   Had a few starters which tasted delicious   Sat outside  even with the heat the umbrellas and misters made it comfortable   Will definitely visit again ,4,2015-04-30
Food and atmosphere was great  The service was not so good  Three out of   of us  all got our dinners  while the other person did not  It actually took    minutes for him to get his dinner  It was shrimp tacos no less  I mean how long could it take to bring out shrimp tacos    It makes for an awkward dining experience when one person doesn t get their meal  And it taking so long  We had a hard time making contact with our waiter  and seemed a new waiter was showing up at our table throughout the night  I d give my experience a   star  but the food was good  and I m hoping it was an off night  I ll definitely try it again  If service remains crappy  then I ll change my review   My turkey burger was really good  I exchanged the pear aioli sauce for the cranberry aioli  It was heavenly  The beer selection  obviously very good  Fun night  good food  just wish our service was better ,4,2019-03-12
More beers  yes please    Was on a self guided brewery tour of Arizona  Stopped in here for more brews    Started with Give  em Pumpkin to Talk About  I ll give em more than that to talk about  This beer was amazing    For my second beer I had a chocolate milk stout  Very nice undertones of vanilla  A very easy beer to drink    The atmosphere is very cozy  Comfy couch type seats if you re sitting outside  The vibe is great    Dog friendly as well    Our waiter was great  Didn t rush and came back often ,5,2019-12-08
Love their cheese burger so much that I can t bring myself to order anything else  BUT I have been with other people who ve ordered other food and none have been disappointed  Maybe next time I ll get the burger   ask my husband to get something not burger and we can split  That s probably the only way I ll get to sample the menu  The servers   bartenders are friendly  The place is clean  well priced and I keep telling people to go there,5,2019-05-19
Always love this place  relaxed easy vibe delicious avocado toast l  veggie scramble and the most amazing gluten free chocolate desert   Love the laid back atmosphere   The music is an eclectic mix of    s     s and current tunes   One of the best places for brunch  don t miss the penny mimosas   A great place to linger  watch the game or just hang out ,5,2019-06-15
Your back patio smells like dog poop  The lower seating chairs are covered in dog hair   Animals are great but your venue isn t friendly anymore   Sad,1,2019-05-05
This place was great   I m a salad girl   and it was hard to pick because they all looked fabulous  I went with the cob and it was a great choice  But my husband on the other hand is a carnivorous beer drinker  So he had a buffalo chicken sandwich with pickled apples sounded weird to him  but to his surprise he loved it  and a pitcher of     in his words  an amazing beer  at happy hour it was only       Great place if you have kids also ,5,2017-12-29
Seemed pretty noisy   hard to hear people talking  The food is pretty good for bar food though ,4,2019-12-06
Came here to meet a couple friends  service was super good  great Saturday brunch menu  I had the Hot Chicken and Biscuits  I will be coming back soon ,5,2019-11-10
We really enjoyed the food and especially there beer flight  The only issue we had was that even though we were seated inside they had all the doors open to the outside seating so it was very hot ,4,2019-09-10
Sunday Funday is super busy  Outdoor seating is where you can bring ya puppies  Kids are welcomed  Drinks are strong and delicious  Mountainside mojito was delicious  Chicken and waffles with bacon was ON point  I was soo focused and amused by my handsome date I didn t get to snap any photos    next time  Great Sunday  ,5,2019-02-18
Came here for their weekend brunch today  Even though it was warm we chose to sit outside so our kiddos could run around  We ordered the avocado toast and plantain French toast  Both were absolutely yummy   Food definitely exceeded my expectations  Each brunch item comes with beer or mimosa which was equally amazing  We will definitely return for brunch again ,4,2019-07-13
Ah  OHSO  I really love this place  The atmosphere is chill and relaxed  The outdoor seating is pretty unparalleled  The staff is typically very friendly  Excellent beer and beverage selection  And they are SO dog friendly  My last review was a bit bitter  but this place has a place in my heart  Happy hour after happy hour  OHSO wins   Though the veggie burger is delicious and keeps me coming back  They can really improve on offering their vegans some other options ,4,2019-09-29
My husband had a burger and it was great  My pork bowl was really fatty and the flavor was not good and came out cold  THERES DOG HAIR EVERYWHERE BLOWING AROUND GETTING INTO OUR FOOD  We had bloody Mary s and only got half a beef jerky stick each the flavor was good though  It was extremely crowded and FILLED with children  Can t enjoy a game of corn hole without stopping every   seconds to wait for their parents to grab them  Waitress came to get our drink and food order and then we didn t see her until we got our check  WILL NOT be coming back  Cool layout but terrible experience  Two stars ONLY because my husband said his burger was good,2,2019-03-23
Prepare for excoriation  you troglodytes posing as gastropub employees   I ve never been treated with such disdain and rudeness in any establishment before this  I ve also had years of experience working both as a waiter and bartender  I know when someone s having a bad day and when he s a sawed off excuse for a human being   I arrived at O H S O  on Tatum at about      or so on Sunday night with eight friends  We had just come from a wedding reception with almost no food or alcohol  and still in our vests and nice outfits  were looking for a casual dinner and drink   When the server  who  by the way  was rude to one of my friends who asked for a glass of water   what do you think  he s here just to sip H O   checked my fiance s ID  she said she had to get a manager to check it  Okay  understandable  my fianc  is from New York  maybe the server s not familiar with the appearance of the NY state driver s license   When the manager came over and scrutinized the license  he said  It s pretty dirty   The license is a few years old  but situated sideways like it ought to be for someone over     I asked  Do you want to bring her over into stronger light and take a look   We were out back where the lights were dimmed  Of course he couldn t see the license clearly   This pathetic juice box of a man looks back at me and drips condescendingly   Okay buddy I can handle this   I shut up and sat back  Then he says  I can t accept an ID in this condition  Do you have another form of ID   When she didn t  he actually said  Well you can go home if you want and get one and come back    Are you kidding  She s from NEW YORK  you cretin  He must have been able to see the anger on my face  because he then asked me  You got something you want to say   in that tone of voice that thinly veils a big  fuck you   You know the one   I had plenty  but I just said  Cancel our order  please   I had ordered the Surf and Turf  Does this moron actually think we re some kind of sting operation  or we re college kids sneaking an underage girl in with us  We were there to spend and tip   My poor fianc  felt terrible  but luckily that bilious rat didn t ruin our night  All nine of us got up and went across the street to the Greek place  where they took great care of us  Good job  O H S O  Way to treat your guests   If you need to refuse service to someone  I understand  I get it  I been there  But you don t have to be a giant prick about it  Stay away from this location and go to the O H S O  on Indian School  they ve always been fantastic ,1,2015-11-11
The Diablo burger was awesome and the chocolate beer is excellent  Wife had the shrimp tacos ,5,2015-03-24
Not bad service and food  Wish they had more choices of dipping sauces  Good beer selection ,3,2017-08-01
Great place   Dog friendly  plenty of misters and fans to keep cool in the blazing Phoenix heat  great craft beers  corn hole and other outdoor games  friendly staff and the food is pretty   correction   VERY damn good too   I had the Brisket Mac   A generous portion of creamy  cheesy mac n  cheese  topped with slow cooked  succulent  brisket topped with more melted cheese  a smokey spicy BBQ sauced topped with crispy fried onion rings   This can ordered as an appetizer for the table  a side dish to share  or an entree for one   Now  if you re one of those people who doesn t like dogs and gets all weird if a restaurant allows dogs inside I have three pieces of advice for you     don t have kids because you re a horrible human being and shouldn t be allowed to have any influence over children     Find the nearest  tall  bridge and jump off of it     Don t go to OHSO because they allow dogs all over the place   In fact they hold dog adoption drives on most weekends   However  if you like dogs and don t mind seeing them around while you enjoy a great meal along with an ice cold beer while sitting outside watching people play out door games  this is definitley the place for you   Oh  you can also sit inside the comfortable dinning area where they have a bar and TV s ,4,2015-06-25
The service here is great and the food is worth going back for   The outdoor area is large and comfortable  even in the summer time ,4,2017-06-09
We visited OSHO while visiting Az for the weekend  What a fun concept this restaurant is  I loved the decor and the fun gaming area  We had a small wait time of    minutes  but found a spot at the outside bar where we indulge in some terrific mimosas  We got the chips and guacamole  which was amazing  We shared the burger as well  It was good but not the best we have ever had  we killed the fries through    Over all when we travel back to Az we would be more than happy coming back to this fun restaurant ,4,2016-04-26
So technically this is my first review and check in  however we ve come here so many times   for years too  almost regulars now    Today we met a new friend  Leah  our server  She was awesome  Nice girl and great server   Food is always amazing here  service is perfect every time   drinks are def local and very good here    Very cool hang out place with an outside patio  and yes you can bring your  if you want too ,5,2017-06-17
I love your OHSO Brewery in Arcadia  and I like you in PV  A similar vibe here  but the food just wasn t as good here as your other location  I wanted to love your beer selection but you were out of a few of my favorites  Service was sluggish and you were not busy  So I d probably try you again  but then again I might stick to my old favorite ,3,2017-08-03
LOVE  O H S O  Who wouldn t love a place with great beer  delicious food  and doggies all over the patio    I highly recommend the pretzel board  the cheese sauce is out of this world  Burgers are amazing  and steak with garlic fries     Ummm  yes  please     ,4,2016-04-03
Stopped by for a salad and soda and was pleasantly surprised by the fun ambiance and friendly service  Super dog friendly  The menu is limited but decent  The salad  blue cheese and bacon  was fresh and well presented  Plan on this place being noisy  loud music and games like beanbag toss and ping pong  Great for kids ,4,2015-04-27
Great outdoor space and our waitress  Breanna  was awesome  The food was delicious  bacon and Gouda burger  and the menu had good choices  My only issue is with the beers  which are good to very good  but not great   If this was just a restaurant  it would get five stars    Handlebar Hefe  very good  Peppermint Porter  good     Ale  very good ,4,2017-04-04
  stars for the perfect beer recommendation   The burger  not so much  It fell apart as I was trying to eat it   Nice servers    Go here more for the beers than the food ,3,2017-01-10
The atmosphere is awesome  We sat inside with our baby but next time we will definitely be bringing our pups along with us as they are extremely dog friendly  The food was great and the service was good  Thankfully they had a vegan menu but it consisted of salads and one burger  I m happy and thankful they have vegan options but wish they had more options  We will definitely be back though ,4,2017-07-18
Food was mediocre and portions were small  The beer was decent and average priced  The staff was very friendly  I probably wouldn t eat here again but would definitely go for some beers  I liked the atmosphere decor of the place ,3,2016-07-31
We met friend for happy hour drinks outside and had a great time   The guys were entertained by ping pong and other games  and we loved seeing the dogs that people had with them there   Fun atmosphere and great drinks ,5,2016-04-03
Go for the ambiance  Really fun nightlife  Sat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly  drinks were super good  Food was fine  For large groups it might not be the best as it is loud  unless you want to sit outside  Tends to get busy later into dinner service  don t be surprised if there is a wait ,3,2018-11-02
Been here a couple of times   Drinks and appetizers are awesome and definitely worth it during happy hour   Food is about average above average along with average service   It s a great place for a happy hour ,4,2016-06-29
What horrible service  My grandson cracked his head by the table tennis  We notified them if this dangerous area  The manager stated that this area is for adults and gave a band aid  No signs no apologies very sad experience F em   Yes he was supervised he was playing with his mother  The dangerous area was a bad weld that needs to be smoothed out ,1,2016-02-13
Love it  Mostly for the atmosphere and social aspect but the food and drinks were also great  Would definitely recommend for a date or hang out spot with some good brews ,5,2015-07-20
Came here Sat night around      pm after first trying Fate Brewery before and never getting acknowledged  menus or ordering before we walked out after    minutes  OHSO quickly found us a table and took care of us  Great beer choices  food was also great although they have a limited late menu  it s still available and better than most late night options ,4,2015-07-20
Fantastic atmosphere  good food  good beer selection  kid friendly  awesome patio great place to enjoy for the whole family ,4,2015-04-09
I love this new location  The patio is amazing  lots of games and tables  The happy hour menu is perfect for drinks after work ,5,2015-06-09
I love love love this place  The patio is always full of dogs  which makes me smile  If you don t want to be around dogs though  eat inside  The service is always great and their food is delicious  I love the az burger  It has jalape o cream cheese and crispy onions on top  The bun is really good  it s a little bit sweet but works well with the saltiness and spicy cream cheese  I hardly ever order anything else because their burger is so amazing  They have brunch in the weekends that is fun  You get a mimosa or beer with the purchase of a brunch entree  I wish this place were closer to me because I d be here all the time ,5,2016-11-11
Great fun place  Been to the other locations  this one is actually my fav  My son and I go here for happy hour between school work and soccer practice  Service is ALWAYS outstanding  friendly  and quick  Food is always fresh  cooked exactly right  and served quickly  Also  cornhole  ping pong  and petting the many canine visitors are also plusses  Great family friendly place  good beer and drinks  great food  excellent staff  and even lots of outdoor seating available almost always  Even our pitbull loves this place   What are you waiting for ,5,2018-06-29
Omg   So much potential and  sad to say but i will not be back   The service is so brutal    Is it because the younger generation  who seems to be the only ones hired to work there  The problem is the service is provided by younger people who get zero eye contact and could give a hoot if you are taken care of      mins to be able to order a drink     mins to bring the drinks and drinks are expensive and week   Food was great but dirty plates sat on table for our whole duration    When food is delivered  there are no roll ups brought or offered offierd  i will bot come to this place  n,2,2018-09-13
Stopped in for late lunch on vacation   It was       which meant    pitchers for happy hour  we tried the Mr  Pineapple which was pretty good  but went on to tru the popcycle  their brand brew  and we werent too impressed   supposed to be a lemon raspberry beer but tasted very fake  kind of like kool aid and beer   BUT  we had the AZ burger  with veggie patty  and it was amazing    even the fries were likely the best I ve ever had  haha     all in all  I d definitely go back,5,2016-10-18
I have since been back  Though it was a couple of months ago and had just as good of a second experience as the first  I would definitely recommend  Definitely recommend it for lunch and brunch ,5,2016-06-23
It s been really nice having ohso open in the neighborhood  We ve enjoyed several evenings here  Love the patio games  atmosphere   brews   Food is nothing special  We ve tried different dishes and all are ok  to be expected from a bar  No culinary skills here   Which is why I m docking   star    I m docking   stars for service      Went in today    pm  place was somewhat busy BUT half of the outside patio tables were EMPTY   they said there was an hour wait    Whaat     We hung out because they really do have a cool patio  Waited for   mins to be seated meanwhile   tables were empty the entire time we were there   That s just RIDICULOUS   They allow you to get a drink at the bar but you can t take any food on the patio  so we sat for nearly an hour staring at empty tables waiting to be seated  starving     I m extremely peeved by the horrible service   If I return it will be after some time  I ll need to cool off     only because my kids enjoy the patio    Hope management figures out there seating situation  I wasn t the only one upset ,2,2015-05-21
I m coming back  This place is the coolest  We chose to sit outside under the shaded patio and cool misters  very casual setting  They have ping pong tables corn hole tables and dog friendly  pets are allowed  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of menu and suggestions for us  I ordered the brisket sandwich with fries and washed it down with a Blueberry milkshake IPA beer  The sandwich was delicious and the beer was even better  Service was good and so was the food  I will be making this my go to place for great food and great beer,5,2018-05-06
The veggie burger I ate there was probably the best I ever had and the area we ate in was very spacious and relaxing  Im a big fan of those open kind of environments  I m a smoker which  naturally  they didn t allow inside so overall I still prefer places with outdoor patios where I can really enjoy myself completely but if you don t share that need you should be fine  The drink I had was really good but unfortunately this was weeks ago that I came here and forgot what it was called  Great time ,5,2018-08-27
I like I can take my dog here  They have a great environment for everyone  I really enjoy the turkey burger  The staff is always friendly and more then willing to wait on you  Very enjoyable place to eat with friends and family  Definitely a must try ,4,2018-11-28
Was so happy when this moved into the area  They have a great patio with lots of entertainment  Dog friendly too which is always a plus  Recommend it for brunch ,5,2015-10-25
Love love love this place  Their Asian salad is amazing and I m not even a salad type of girl  The staff is friendly  the place is clean  and the atmosphere is awesome  Most days their is a wait so I wouldn t go during the weekend if you are looking for something quick  But I don t mind waiting for a table while hanging out at their awesome bar with such a great beer variety ,5,2015-08-24
We were sent to OHSO on a whim by the hotel we were staying at and were pleasantly surprised  My husband and I love a good microbrewery but OHSO was so much more than that  The indoor outdoor seating was terrific and I loved the decor  They offer tons of different types of beers on tap as well as a fully stocked bar with top shelf whiskey and our favorite tequila  We both had salads  Cobb and Ensalada de sol  which were very fresh and large  The service was terrific    we had Sam G  as a server and he couldn t have been more friendly and accommodating  This was a great start to our vacation in Scottsdale  Wish we had something like this spot in South Florida   PS  the cucumber in the water is a great touch ,5,2017-10-22
Brought my family here to celebrate my birthday as I wanted to do something a little different  Usually we go to True Foods for all of our family birthdays but I figured I d give this place a try since I heard good things  We sat outside  which was a big mistake  They had a one man live band playing that was just God awful and it reached a point where we couldn t take it anymore and left    When my mom made the reservation that said she could bring my cake and that they d refrigerate it for her  Well  when she brought it  they didn t put it in the fridge so my birthday cake was ruined    The food was decent  I had the veggie burger which was good  The bread was a little doughy but overall it had a good flavor  We also ordered guacamole  which was really good    They have a rather large patio with ping pong and bean bags  which looks like a lot of fun  I wanted to stay and play but it seemed like there was a long wait to play the games and the band was terrible  I don t think I can listen to the Beatles anymore after the guy butchered Let It Be   I m willing to give this place another try even though they pretty much ruined my birthday  I felt bad for my mom because she worked so hard baking my cake ,2,2015-10-30
I hate to write negative reviews  but last night was my second disappointing visit with this location and sadly  will probably be my last  The first evening I was there  we found hair in   of the   dishes we ordered  This was corrected with a credit and complimentary food after we asked to speak to the manager  but still off putting none the less    Last night we were a table of two  we ordered   pitchers of beer and some single served drinks in addition to   appetizers  When we asked for our bill  our server made the comment that he should have charged us for electricity since we took up one of his tables for   hours    if that wasn t rude enough  when he returned with our bill he said  thank you ladies for trying our orange blossom beer and a few appetizers     The rude attitude is what led to leave this review    mistakes happen but there is no excuse for bad customer service ,1,2015-04-17
Love ohso on Tatum and Shea  They have good happy hour as well as games to keep a fun environment such as corn hole and ping pong  Definitely recommend this place anytime of the day   Breakfast  lunch or dinner ,5,2015-10-25
Absolutely one of my favorite breweries  The food alone makes this a must visit eatery  and the outdoor ping pong and corn hole are just icing on the cake ,5,2018-02-24
Really amazing brunch menu  Great beer selection too  Love how it s a local company that shows off local breweries  And how can you not love coming here and seeing all the dogs ,5,2018-09-04
This was my first experience at Primp and Blow   I went before my engagement photos and was not disappointed  What a great place   Definitely booking my hair and make up trial here  Both the girls working there were so nice and helpful and understanding of the fact that i hadn t been there before   They are willing to look at your pinterest photos and will help you create your perfect look ,5,2018-04-20
Love this place  Only issue is the amount of time it takes service to come around out in the patio     They need servers to pay more attention to detail in their sections  It takes too long for someone to come to the table     They need more floating servers to handle people without a table  I ve waited    mins and nearly chased someone down to get a drink ,4,2015-11-23
I love the vibe at OHSO and the food is AMAZING  Tons of beer and drinks to choose from  The only issue I have is all the children running around throwing rocks and water everywhere  I understand that as a business you can t tell parents how to raise children  but you can make rules at the brewery for other customers enjoyment  This has happened on multiple occasions  I have been a customer for a long time and I always enjoy the menu and staff  I have brought my dog there  but I was quite embarrassed when I brought my parents here for a  good time  and all we did was avoid the rock throwing from the all the kids playing  It was so bad that our poor server dropped her tray of drinks on the ground because an unsupervised child ran right into her  This is a brewery not a child day care center ,4,2016-04-25
My husband and I were visiting and asked the resort for a good place to have a cold beer and OHSO was recommended  Happy hour pitchers were only    and my hubby said the beer that was recommended to him was fantastic  They had a nice white wine selection  The artichoke dip was yummy and came with both chips and pita bread  We ordered salads for our mains and they were both great   The best part of the night was the service   We were immediately happily greeted at the door and seated  our drink order was taken after all our questions were answered and brought out fast by the best servers ever  The entire wait staff at OHSO are wonderful   ,5,2018-06-25
Can t believe I have not reviewed OHSO before  We have been to all three valley locations and this one is definitely our favorite    We are out for a Sunday morning breakfast  stopped by three other places all had    minute waits  As a last resort we stopped in for the brunch and beer  OMG so glad we did     I had the breakfast bowl with streak  Really good the steak was perfect very filling for the size   Wife had avocado toast and loved it   Granny had the classic complained her eggs were hard  had she eaten them in the beginning they would have been fine    All in all another great experience at OHSO    Great staff  great service and dog friendly and very good local beer selection ,5,2018-02-25
Went tonight for the first time and was so disappointed after all the hype   Yes  it s got a wonderful  casual vibe and probably a great place for drinks and to kick back  if I drank   Since I do not  I went for the Sunday afternoon Barbecue  Luau  which sounded great  but I was greatly disappointed   The food is not only bad  it is horrible   We had the garlic shrimp tacos  and the shrimp were raw and tasteless   The guacamole was also tasteless  and I never had salsa that was pureed   Very weird   And the tortillas were dry and hard   I mean it couldn t get any worse   And the barbecue was also poorly done   The hoisin beef actually tasted good  but the pork was sour and the rice was cold and dry   If I take up drinking  I ll go hang there  but would never go just to eat again     stars for ambiance     stars for food     stars for service   Oh  and it has a dog friendly patio which is really cool  but in     degrees  it is not the day to have your dog sit for hours on a cement ground  even with misters   Cruel  cruel  cruel ,2,2015-06-15
This place is rad   if you like a lot of dogs and rouge children hanging out with you   which I DO  Dog heaven and so much for our kiddo to do whilst we ate  Met friends here for brunch  TONS of space and outdoor seating  Very energetic atmosphere  Great server  food was good  and cool set up  re  eclectic tables  rustic decor  games like cornhole and ping pong  etc   And the fact that they are so supportive of dog rescue speaks to me on a deep level  I m only withholding one star cuz the food is good but not over the top good   I m paleo and was able to find several options and was happy with my breakfast tacos   ,4,2019-01-19
This restaurant truly has it all  Great food  great staff  and an overall great atmosphere  I went for brunch with my kids on Sunday  I ordered the Chicken and Waffles  I am from the south  so I know what good Chicken and Waffles are  and these were fantastic  My kids ordered the pancakes and were very happy with them as well  I will definitely be returning here next weekend for a taste of home    PS  Ask for Tim as your server  He is so kind and was a blast to talk to ,5,2019-06-01
Ohso is awesome   I love the fact that I can bring my dogs and the staff always loves on them  Happy hour is incredible   and popcycle blonde is my favorite beer  ,5,2017-06-09
We went there for happy hour and an early dinner on a late Friday afternoon  The food was acceptable pretty good  the beer was somewhat chilled  they had a very wide   stylish variety  and the service was OK  There are quite a few better restaurants in the Phoenix area  Overall        this restaurant was average and nothing to  write home about  ,3,2016-03-04
This place was so fun  Good brunch  with penny refills on mimosas   Dog friendly  which is awesome  Good food  good drinks  relaxed  and casual  Good times ,5,2016-02-15
Went in this morning for brunch and from the beginning it was already a terrible experience  We had a large party so I kept ignoring the little things thinking it s just because we had a large party  Well the little things went from my daughters waiting over    minutes for a sprite and a lemonade to our waitress  Alexis  completely missing half of the table when taking the orders and then to finish it all off   of us never got our food and had to wait about    minutes from when the rest of the table had theirs  In the end Alexis made excuses and argued instead of apologizing or doing anything to make it better  She offered to take stuff off the bill but didn t do that either  She actually charged us for things that she never even brought  All in all it was a terrible experience and there is no reason to go back  Oh  and it took her    minutes to even bring us the check and then another    to finally bring everything back  Unimpressed ,2,2019-11-03
Excellent environment  Ask Anthony for a drink recommendation  Kaylee was an amazing server  Dirty chai martini comes out on Wednesday  It was a very classy cocktail ,5,2019-11-10
Huge fan of the brunch OHSO has to offer  It s great and the restaurant is the absolute cutest and SO dog friendly  They have games to play and an entire dog area  The beer is great and the food is amazing ,5,2019-05-19
Recently met with a very old friend of mine over the weekend  and he choose this location  I have never heard of them before  and I will say I was quite surprised  Lot of dog owners who bring their animals  so make sure you re aware of this before dining  No  they re not service animals   Decor  The brewery has an amazing open concept with seating both covered outside  open outside  bars  and tables  It has a wonderful feel to it  and you re able to see the brewery from the inside  Seats are comfortable  and I love the colors they have  Highly recommend it for those who like vibrant colors   Service  We sat at the bar  because a Sunday afternoon is incredibly busy  so good luck getting a spot  The bar was getting hit hard due to the amount of drinks being ordered  and I felt horrible for the lone girl working the well  She asked multiple times for help  and for    minutes  she was on her own  We had to get our own silverware  menus  etc  I understand being busy   but some attention is good  I also wasn t a huge fan of one of the bartenders acting surprised when we said we would like to order food   oh  you want food  Um ok   Does that seem appropriate  No   Food  They had brunch menus that ended at    and sadly we were forced to order off that  I would ve rather ordered something else  but I didn t know  I personally had the chicken and waffles  and my friend had the fruity pebble french toast  My chicken and waffles was a little rough  the chicken was super dry  and the waffles tasted like hardened sugar  The spicy maple syrup also didn t work for me  Maybe I just got a bad batch   Drinks  Big drink menu  obviously  I didn t order a drink so I don t have a comment on this   Overall  It s hard to say honestly  I want to try this place out again  but if the food is like this during lunch dinner time  I won t ever come back  There are a ton of other breweries that offer quality food for different prices  Again  please try this location out for yourself though  I do believe that it deserves an afternoon stop ,3,2019-03-12
Had been telling my husband how amazing this place was   Had an awesome time   Food was amazing    Bar was amazing  We paid our      tab for lunch and decided to sit near the band that had just started playing  with our drinks   The waitress asked us to leave the table and see the hostess stand   We went to the hostess stand and we were reseated right across from where we were originally seated  where there were still multiple open tables and we finished our drinks within    min minutes   We tipped our new server    for the waters he provided    Would have ordered additional beverages but we were turned off  There needs to be a revision in the policy  no server should be demanding a paying customer be removed from an area when they have already spent good money      Last impressions last a long time ,1,2019-10-06
No need for another visit to fully embrace O H S O  Paradise Valley  The patio is awesome  We visited just after      p m  on a Monday  Walked right in  Picked up a free homemade dog treat at the counter for the pooch accompanying us and took a seat      degrees outside  No worries  Giant fans and misters kept the patio quite comfortable  Will your puppy be lonely  You must be kidding  There were about ten other dogs on site this night  Will the kids behave  Not a problem  Ping pong    will occupy them  I can t imagine why you would want to go inside to the bar  The patio has such a fun and energetic vibe  Well  the bar might be a better choice for you if you hate dogs or hate kids or hate dogs and kids  For the rest of us  Embrace the chaos   Oh yes  They do serve food  Our server was very helpful  sitting with us in the booth for a moment to review the menu and local beer options  I get the sense that they ve figured out the service issues that several reviewers mentioned early on  We opted for one of the mac and cheese dishes and one of the hamburgers  Both were outstanding  Not at all the mediocre bar food I was expecting  And yes  the pup loved the free treat  He had to have seconds  The water bowl they gave him  without asking  came in handy as well   We can t wait to come back  The outdoor game concept is pretty common these days  but the extent to which O H S O  embraces our canine friends separates it from the pack ,5,2015-07-21
The patio is fantastic  the beers are okay  some of the wines are good  the food is total crap   I give up   No More ,2,2016-02-18
Alright so I have been to O H S O  several times but not since I started participating in Yelp  From the start they won my heart with great beer and excellent service  While I started at the Arcadia location  it is the paradise valley location that I prefer  Partly because of proximity mostly because of the serv ce that compliments the product  I firmly believe that the staff treats their brewing  distilling  and cooking processes with the same care and respect shown to the customers  Truly outstanding  Now for the good stuff  the beer is incredible and while they have many good choices I love the Lost Viking Porter  Their liquor is also delicious and under two brands    and Arcadia  The   brand is vodka  rum and gin  The basics but made very well and very smooth  Arcadia is their flavored brand  of which I have only tried the coffee vodka    Here is a nugget for you  ask for a shot of coffee vodka in the bottom of your glass before they pour the Lost Viking porter in there    From the kitchen I Love  love  love the brisket Mac and cheese  They also offer chicken and waffles  my parents favorite  and biscuits with beer gravy  The menu has great variety without being overwhelming with too many options  Super unique  super delicious ,5,2018-01-16
The best bloody mary s in town  I love going to this place  Very affordable and it s always a great time ,5,2017-03-15
Came here for the  st time on a Saturday  And soon realized this was a place you d either love or hate  I love the atmosphere and all the games available to play while you wait for your food  And I loved the food  The shrimp and crab Mac n chz was delicious as were the shrimp tacos  The selection of beers was huge  I love that you could bring your dog if you wanted to  that s huge for dog lovers      I did not like all of the kids running around playing all the games  not allowing for the adults to play  it seemed more like a Chuckie Cheese in that sense  If we couldnt enjoy the games while we waited for our food I would ve liked to enjoy a conversation with my husband without the sound of a barking dog interrupting it  I also felt the prices were a little high compared to the portion sizes  I think I would go back but would sit in the dining room instead of the patio  or maybe get the food to go ,4,2016-08-15
No wonder they had to open this THIRD location  OHSO never disappoints  This restaurant bar is a lot larger than the others featuring a patio  partially covered  that welcomes animals and groups of people ready to play games  The food hasn t changed a bit and always satisfies  I d recommend the Arizona Burger which has a spicy jalapeno cream cheese  yumm   if you come during happy hour they have    bites to include cheese wontons and egg dip  The beer selection is definitely not lacking and they strive to have lots of local options  OHSO is a great place for any occasion  brunch  lunch  happy hour  dinner or just drinks   give it a try ,5,2016-02-10
I love the atmosphere of this little piece of paradise  Great for dog lovers people love to have fun  We got the calamari was OK but good  Enjoy the sweet potato fries and the selection of beer is awesome ,4,2018-07-25
Huge place with plenty of seating indoors and outside   The service is fast and friendly   They have a large selection of beers especially from Arizona breweries   The food is just so so   The artichoke dip was pretty good but a pretty small serving   The cheeseburger was nothing special and the fries were too salty to finish eating   Come for the beer and atmosphere and skip the food unless you are famished ,3,2015-07-11
I meannnnnn     I want to love OHSO  But I just don t  It s always a cool vibe  a beautiful and fun restaurant  the beer list was good today   First things first  the hostess staff was unwelcoming  no smiles  very matter of fact  Meh  We had the new champagne beer  a hazy  that wasn t at all hazy   a double IPA and a prickly pear something Mesa  The beers were nice  and I m a super beer snob  My first beer was the cheer haze but I was brought something else by mistake  that mistake was quickly rectified by a different staff member  We ordered the pretzel board which came out quickly and was delicious   Our dinner order was taken and Then our server said he was going home and was transferring our table  NBD  he wasn t great anyway  New server arrives  she knows absolutely nothing about beer  Whatever  I m a beer snob  I can figure out my way around the menu   Food arrived  short rib tacos were subpar  the gobbler burger was GREAT  Sweet potato fries were cold  I ordered a phantasmagoria by one of my fave breweries  the expo couldn t pronounce it  nor did she try  Not a big deal  but maybe get to know the beers on your tap list  We finished our beers and food  the restaurant was clearing out  our server was nowhere to be found for several minutes  but I did spot a familiar face  our former server who was still taking tables  Haha  we finally received our bill  and left feeling satisfied for the most part but their staff and customer service need a serious overhaul  Our second server was friendly enough but had absolutely zero knowledge about anything related to beer  Just meh ,3,2018-08-26
I have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally went with a friend  I was excited because they offer a gluten free menu  as well as a vegan one   This establishment is also dog friendly  which I love  The patio is lined with misters and even on a hot day  it was rather cool on the patio   Although a server didn t stop by until after my friend arrived  about    minutes after I was seated  the rest of the experience warrants future visits  My friend ordered the Crispy Pork Belly and I ordered a Hot Pastrami sandwich on a GF bun  from their gluten free menu  The GF bun was tasty as was the sandwich  The fries were okay  I wanted to order the Flourless Chocolate Cake as I heard it was fabulous  but I was too stuffed  next time though ,4,2017-06-20
We love this place because we adopted our dog here   but tonight was a living hell   It was chuck e cheese without the order and parental control   Kids pounding on the ping pong table over and over with paddles  No parents   Kids running and screaming all over   No parents  Absolutely ridiculous ,4,2016-08-27
If you re looking for a place to try out new local beers  this is it  They have a lot of great local brews that you can try out before you buy    For the price  you are much better off buying a pitcher which comes with right around     glasses of beer    I am a repeat customer here  I don t have any complaints about this place  really  I enjoy coming here with friends for lunch or even evening drinks  The atmosphere is amazing  They have a great outside area with bags and other games that are very fun to play after you ve got a couple of drinks in you  Makes for a good time with friends   The Brisket Mac is absolutely my favorite thing on this menu  It is a very big bowl of Mac and cheese with perfectly cooked brisket mixed into it    The Guacamole is definitely interesting as they add pumpkin seeds to it  adding a nutty flavor  It s not bad  but over priced for sure    Price is the only thing OHSO could work on in my opinion  Their appetizers could come down in cost  and would make me a regular here  All other dishes are decently priced  but still on the higher end    Servers always have an upbeat attitude and make you feel welcome here  They check on you as often as they should making sure all drinks are topped off when they need to be ,4,2017-02-13
The food and drinks are great  but every time I ve been on the patio other people s dogs and children have wandering up to my table  almost knocked my things over  interrupted my conversations  and created non stop distractions  I get the neighborhood vibe but some people who aren t aware of what s going on around them ruin it for me each time ,3,2017-10-31
I love this place soo much because it has so many different selections of beer and a lot of places to sit  It is very packed sometimes but you can get a table in about    minutes so I don t mind  There is also a lot of places for kids to play around at  There is a grass patch for dogs to play and for kids to play too ,5,2018-11-06
Decided to try OHSO today  My brother in law said the burgers were good so I ordered the AZ Burger which is what our server recommended    SERVICE     stars Though it was busy we got sat right away   After    minutes of waiting for our food  we flagged our server to have her check on the status  The delay was  you husband s chicken salad   It shouldn t take that long to coolness burger and make a salad   FOOD     stars My burger was so dry and my fries were stale   They were also room temperature instead of being hot  Again we flagged our server and she was kind enough to place a new order  Second round was MUCH better because I ordered it medium   Tip  Servers make sure to ask how customers want their burgers cooked   The flavor was quite lacking  Also the second burger only took about      mins  which shoyld have beem the fistt time  They need to season with salt and pepper  My husband s salad was decent but nothing spectacular   Glad we finally tried it but will stick with Hopdoddy s or Zin Burger if I ever want a burger ,3,2016-11-05
Average at best  Food is mediocre  service is horrible most of the time  but great beer selection and love the variety or their own beer  local beer and national beer  Their own vodka is good as well  Was given a taste of their newer whiskey but didn t care for it  as it had a strong peach flavor  Hard to determine who your server is because there is no meaningful communication and if you go at the wrong time you will get passed from one server to another several times so recommend sitting at the bar  For food the dishes I did like were the pretzels and cheese dip  the salmon BLT and the Mac Del Mar ,3,2018-03-07
I specifically asked for the vegan menu   and was told they didn t have one  I knew they did but I just said ok that s fine I ll be able to figure something out    minutes later they came back with the vegan menu they were unaware they had  I ordered the Kale and pear salad off the VEGAN menu  It came out and had cheese all over it    I was on a second date and didn t want to make a deal of it so I didn t say anything and ate a little around it  Plus I didn t want to waste any food by having them remake it  Please train your servers on different dietary needs  I also was brought some spicy salad dressing instead of the citrus one ,2,2018-04-06
excellent food and service  It has great energy and the outdoor seating and bar are excellent  Also this place is dog friendly ,5,2017-02-08
The manager contacted me and explained that this restaurant has a tipping pool and that was the reason why so many people attended to our table  My suggestion is that they inform guests of this prior to ordering to avoid misunderstandings like ours  Also they said they now have the brewery up and running so there should be more local beers available  We might come back for the beer but that s about it ,3,2016-02-16
Sunday night at   and there is a    minute wait for a table yet we notice many in the bar and outside but we ride it out and get drinks at the bar  Only two bartenders for a    person bar and service is slow  In fact  I m watching my bartender talk to her friends for   minutes before she comes over after she we first told me to hold on so she could finish her personal conversation   I wanted to pay for my drinks but she was too busy talking with her friends to come over  I had to call her over  again  and she again told me to hold on while she finished her personal conversation    We went to join our friends playing foosball on the patio and waited about    minutes for our table  Once seated we ordered the steak and cheese fries which were a cool combination of fries and mini steak cubes with a spicy sauce which were pretty tasty   Unfortunately  the service dried up after that  Our entrees     of us  took another    minutes and the Italian farmhouse salad was lacking everything but the salad greens  No prosciutto  couscous and quinoa to be found  The manager  after   minutes of searching for any staff  finally  came by to replace it  Not once did our waitress come by because we found out    minutes later she had been cut and not stopped by to let us know    Worst customer service I ve seen in quite a while and this restaurant needs to have a complete lesson in customer service if they  expect to survive in this location  The tacos were good but it was the same steak cubes in the steak and fries   NOT RECOMMENDED UNTIL THEY RE STAFF LOCATION ,2,2015-03-23
Excellent beer choices and quality food The service is outstanding  and everyone is very friendly and professional   This is a go to place ,5,2015-10-25
One of the coolest places  Dog friendly and they have a huge patio for your fur babies  I go here for that    the fact they have different types of vodka and the beer is AMAZING  So different than your basic bud light  Spice it up and try OHSO ,5,2017-10-12
Oh man    super impressed by the atmosphere and chill environment with dogs everywhere  The worst part of our experience as a group was we asked a food runner blonde short hair  glasses  curvy girl  and I m describing you because you weren t professional enough to come back for me to get your name  well we asked her to  when you have a second do you mind taking a picture  her response was rude and her huffing and puffing attitude was dished right back to her  She said well um can I get this stuff out of my hands first rolling her eyes annoyed  I m sorry I don t care who you are if you work in the service industry and your GOOD at it which your not  there was plenty of other ways to say no or yes or I m busy  Your RUDE  And the food was basically microwaved my chicken sandwich tasted like the chicken sandwiches from my school lunch in  th grade ,1,2017-10-23
This is a great place to meet with friends and family   Dog friendly too   Sunday Brunch is great   Sunday evening is even better,5,2016-10-17
Warning    this place does NOT have Sunday Ticket  It seems a little ridiculous that a bar with     Tvs is only able to play one or two games on Sunday s  However it is a great atmosphere and location  Also  we ve had a couple occasions where the staff was a little unapproachable  We did have one experience where the server was fantastic though  I guess it just needs a little fine tuning  I am an F B Manager in the area myself so I know that it can be difficult to perfect these small details on a newer location ,2,2015-10-04
Food is always good and the Boom  Dynamite I P A  has too be my favorite beer right now  Service is always great too ,5,2017-04-30
Oh so underwhelming  service and cold food on a late Sunday afternoon  Yes it s great you can bring the kiddos and pups  a big plus for me but not much else wowed us  We didn t see the same server twice and had to wait about    minutes just to get a drink order in  It was not busy and there were a lot of employees hanging out by the bar  I don t care if we have to wait a little bit but one beer came then we waited for a really long time for mine  It was kind of warm out  so a cold beer or even water was needed  I don t get the whole aioli spin either  it s just spiced up mayo  The appetizer I wanted was way overpriced and I just wasn t impressed with the menu varieties at all  The only thing I would ever go for would be the patio atmosphere  which is in full supply all over town  Wiping down either of the menu would have been nice  never noticed that anywhere else before but they were just SUPER dirty here ,2,2016-05-11
My Son and Daughter in Law took me out for my birthday dinner here  I was very surprised and pleased with the atmosphere  the great food and beverages My husband and I had the short ribs with mashed potatoes  it was to die for the   the beef ribs were marinated in beer and other good stuff  the demi glace was rich and creamy  the mash was creamy with brussel sprouts yum  We will definitely go back for this dish and the specialty hamburgers  A must place to eat ,4,2017-08-03
Love OHSO for everything from Father s Day brunch  to bringing kids and dogs for more fun dining experience  soccer end of season get together  etc   huge menu  great service  super fun experience   Food is good  and they even have a separate vegan vegetarian menu with some great options if you are trying to eat more plant based   Highly recommend ,5,2017-07-30
This place is truly disgusting  And I do not say so lightly  The problem is not the mediocre food  it s the fact that dogs frequent this joint  Not only will you find dog hairs on your chair  table  plate and glasses   but the staff that brings the food to your table routinely pets dogs before and after the food makes it to your table   How can they not realize how inappropriate that is  The same hands that just pet a saliva drooling dog that spent the last hour mopping the dirty restaurant floor  is holding your plate  Nasty nasty nasty ,1,2017-03-26
We love this spot so much that we are up here two to three times every week    We stop by on our way home after work for happy hour  come on the weekends for their brunch  and they do great live music outside on Sunday afternoons   The beer selection is outstanding  the food is quite good  the servers are very personable and a real differentiator as well      It s a fantastic place to sit outside  I just wish they had the outside bar area open during the day as well during the week     Inside is great for watching sports      They are dog and kid friendly  sometimes a little too kid friendly    seriously  as a fellow parent  don t ruin it for the rest of us by letting your children run around like crazy    which is what happens when they are totally unsupervised    But yes  if you re actually spending time with your kids  there are some great outdoor games to enjoy as well   And as a final note  they are very supportive of the local community as well ,5,2017-01-03
Yo  This place was really cool  Warmers for outside sitting and great brews  Took my wife on a date and cannot wait to come back with friends for the games  BTW the food was fantastic as well ,4,2016-12-28
Great place to eat   drink  Really nice staff   very hard working  Bring your kids   dogs along to this brewery  Such a fun ambiance   location  We found this place by default while shopping nearby  I ordered the Chicken   waffles  Amazing  so flavorful  We enjoyed their crafted beer  I had an IPA after my Mimosa  Sunday brunch must haves  ,5,2019-02-05
Love this place  Atmosphere is awesome  superb craft beers  BOOM DYNAMITE is d li shous  Had to take a growler home  AZ burger was also fantastic  Looking for reward to our next trip here ,5,2019-04-14
One of the best places in Phx  Fun and trendy inside  relaxed with a bar and games outside  Lots of dogs  good food  plenty of drinks to choose from  Awesome ,5,2016-03-10
Love  This  Place   What a cool hang out  I haven t yet made it inside  the patio is the place to be  Great beer   Great deals on beer     for the little pitcher  It s only two glasses Brent says   That s a lie    if there s a drop  Plenty to share   The food is amazing  Looks great  tastes even better ,5,2016-12-20
Great food for sure  Only two stars because everyone brings their pets to have dinner   If I wanted to eat around that many dogs I would go to the dog pound    Sad that there are so many codependent people in this world ,2,2018-04-07
This is our favorite Friday night happy hour destination   It is in our  hood so we often see folks we know there  We enjoy it because we can bring our kids and they like it as much as we do   Great patio seating   Great beer selection  Cocktails are tasty   Before      pm you can get a glass of wine or specialty cocktail for      Favorites are the AZ burger  Ensalada del Sol  Brisket Mac   Cheese   Great local place   Highly recommended ,4,2016-05-09
The white chocolate beer is amazing  I could drink gallons of it  The crab dip is also very good   ,4,2015-08-03
I came here last weekend when I was in Arizona for the weekend and I was surprisingly happy with the atmosphere and quality of food  I ordered the chicken and waffles crossing my fingers hoping it was half decent to the place I normally go to in California  To my surprise  it definitely scored much higher than my expectations  The maple bacon was nicely paired with the waffles and crispy chicken  I would have given this place   stars if the service was better  Definitely a must try if you re in the area ,4,2018-06-03
I m coming back  This place is the coolest  We chose to sit outside under the shaded patio and cool misters  very casual setting  They have ping pong tables corn hole tables and dog friendly  pets are allowed  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of menu and suggestions for us  I ordered the brisket sandwich with fries and washed it down with a Blueberry milkshake IPA beer  The sandwich was delicious and the beer was even better  Service was good and so was the food  I will be making this my go to place for great food and great beer ,5,2018-05-03
First time to OHSO and I loved it   We came for brunch and they have the best deal where each brunch entree comes with a      mimosa or beer  so good   I had the breakfast bowl with added green Chile pork  wow  Everything in the bowl was delish  potatoes  eggs  guac  tons of cheese  and a good serving of the pork  I definitely recommend this it was so tasty and a large portion    My husband got the chicken and waffles and was excited that it came with bacon  The chicken was slightly spicy and the waffles were fluffy and sweet    Also  there were a ton of dogs and that was probably my favorite part  Get there early to avoid a wait ,5,2019-05-24
Went with a group of co workers  Environment was good  plenty of room to accommodate a large group  There was a great selection of beer  Overall good was ok  service was nice but a little slow ,3,2016-08-23
Went here with our puppy for some lunch today   Very nice dog friendly place   They give the pups a treat and water   Food is good   Not a huge menu for brunch lunch   I kinda like that   Makes for an easier decision   Perfect weather for patio seating   Good drink selection and penny mimosa with breakfast  ,5,2019-10-19
I have to say OHSO opened at the perfect location to create the perfect neighborhood hangout   The whole setup is perfect for the area where families can walk  yes  you read that right  there are actually lots of families who live in the neighborhood that either walk or bike to OHSO   Anytime you can get Arizonians to forgo their cars and either walk or bike to your dig  you know you are doing something right   Notice the multiple uses of the adjective  perfect   this pretty much sums up OHSO   Any time  any day of the week I can walk into OHSO and bump into someone I know  whether it s my neighbor  families from school  families from activities  people from places I frequent  they are there  drinking  eating   socializing   The best part about OHSO in all of their locations is their atmosphere   It s continually warm and inviting regardless of the weather outside or what else is going on in your life   You walk into OHSO and you feel better     On top of that  besides the huge selection of beer and good food  they have games like ping pong and corn holes outside that are both kid and adult friendly   Did I mention they welcome dogs too   It s the perfect place for people to gather and socialize   I love going there     stars from me   OHSO  ohsobrewery,5,2015-11-05
First of all I d like to point out that this brewery is Dog Friendly    As an avid dog lover this is great to see all the dogs running around on the patio  They also have a designated  dog play  area  This visit was extremely enhanced by the help of our server Sam who is absolutely phenomenal   He took all of our needs into consideration and provided us with the perfect dining experience  He has an exceptional knowledge of all they have to offer and was sure to accommodate all our needs considering we came in just before the end of brunch  This included providing us with the new menu that would be introduced    min later so we could order from either  You must try this place out  Along with exceptional food  Pretzel and Poblano Cheese shout out  you have a long list of drinks to try  You would be doing yourself a favor in checking this place out  Ask for Sam for the perfect experience   ,5,2018-05-13
I love that it s dog friendly   They give your dog a water bowl  It was summer and there s huge fans and monsters outside  It was very nice  Great beer selection  Menu is so unique and delicious  Had guacamole and chips  as my meal I had the brisket and Mac my friend had the grilled cheese with avocado  So good,5,2019-08-20
Love the atmosphere   food and cocktails    The service is below standard  Inconsistent wait service  No one really knows who goes with what tables  Long wait for ordering however food came out in   min         not all at once though     party ate in two shifts  Noisy but fun and if you are a dog lover it s a must just be patient ,4,2019-11-25
This place is the best  Great food  Even better beer  The Fruity Pebbles French toast is crazy awesome wow  But the beer is absolutely the best   Great service  Really good atmosphere  I ve been here at least five times  And every time is better  Highest marks  Recommended to all ,5,2019-06-08
I attended a company party at this location and I have to say the staff was amazing the food was great and the entire area outside was spectacular they had plenty of seating at this location which also included  the bar area   booths   standing tables and other types of table seating as well   In the outdoor area they had ping pong tables   corn hole boards  and some maze challenge boards  just an overall great hangout spot    and if you have a dog they have free dog  biscuits and a separate fake grass area for you and your pet  I will definitely be stopping by here again to try some of there great food and service ,5,2019-12-12
Dog friendly patio  Friendly servers  Food is awesome  Had the pretzel board with sausage  Must try  Kale salad is very large   Must must must try the jalape o polenta  So delicious   Del Mar Mac and cheese has shrimp and is a must try too  The seafood taste is not overwhelming  Some Mac and cheeses don t have balance  It is not the same for this one   I mainly love it because it is so dog friendly and very open   I will definitely be a frequent patron at this location ,5,2019-02-03
Always a great place no matter if you re looking for a meal with some friends or just a happy hour pitcher to ease the mid week blues ,5,2019-08-19
I love this place  But let me explain why I can t give them five stars    The scenery here is great  I love the indoor outdoor vibe  The staff is super friendly and the happy hour is a great deal  However  the beer is always WARM  If the pitchers and glasses were chilled then I would be happy to give this place five stars  I ve been to   OHSO s so far and each time I leave in tears  crying into pitchers of warm beer ,3,2018-04-13
I love ohso  Their brunch never disappoints me  Love how the place is dog friendly  Stumble on this place after hiking with a group of friends and we had a pup with us  Outside is where you can have your furry friends  On the weekends they got good deals on drinks for brunch ,4,2019-07-08
Great place for happy hour      drinks    and     food specials  The outdoor patio is real cute  I was not a big fan of their pretzel and dip appetizer because the pretzel was dry but the dip was good  For drinks  If you like jalape os the cue the lime is delicious and refreshing  If your a cucumber lover try the summertime or the mule with cucumber vodka ,4,2019-04-27
This place is wonderful  Both of my dogs are so welcome every time we go  We ve only been able to get to brunch due to schedules but the food is absolutely lovely and the staff acknowledges the pups as well as the humans  With their own personalized water bowl the pups are happy observing the lovely outdoor patio ,4,2019-04-11
This is my favorite brunch place  The patio bar is the best  Zach is such a great bartender  I ve been in there when I m sad and he always had a joke for me   He is very attentive  He has ninja skills  He can tell when my drink is almost empty and it is refilled before I even get a chance to ask for another  The salmon avocado toast is off the hook    The fact that I can bring my dog and my bike is just amazing ,5,2019-12-06
Love this place  I bring my dog here and he is always happy puggie  He gets treats and attention by the staff all the time ,5,2019-01-13
Great brunch menu and value with the beer mimosa included in the price  Outside of brunch  good beer and food  Highly recommend the happy hour pretzel and beer cheese  Love the atmosphere with dogs everywhere,5,2019-07-14
It s one of my local favorites  Get the Orange Blossom brew with your breakfast and take the pooches  Love brunch and the funky hippster vibe   its not annoying but a refreshing ambiance    Imagine  if you will  a happy convergence of humanity of all generations watching sports  watching dogs and watching each other with a pleasant buzz and a full belly    Food is surprisingly good by the way  Stay far away from the Paradise Valley location  I don t want it to get too busy ,5,2019-07-21
UPDATE  The food is considerably better than it used to be   The waitstaff is cheerful  and I love all the dogs  We like to sit at the bar on Sunday and sip amazing Mimosas  I m glad I never stopped going to this OHSO  they just keep getting better ,4,2019-01-31
Amazingly fun dog park outside  with alcohol and games  need I say more      The food was excellent  I had the portobello burger with sweet potato fries  But goodness  it s like a big party with the dogs  and as a result  everyone is super friendly  It s beautiful weather in AZ right now  late November   but I can imagine it would get pretty hot in other months  Even still  this is place is     and I will be back     We need more dog friendly joints in AZ  and this one is a blast ,5,2015-11-22
This is one of our weekly hangouts  I don t have anything but amazing to report about this and all of the OHSO s  The food  service  atmosphere  and prices are great  Love the variety of beer and it s always fun to be handed a new menu to try the new taps ad you are sitting enjoying your meal  This is our go to place after hiking or to meet for weekend brunches as we always have our fur babies with us and they highly accommodate them as well   ,5,2017-12-07
Too many kids to enjoy the time with grownup friends  Service was nonchalant and not friendly  I will say that the Brisket Mac was excellent ,1,2015-04-01
I wish OHSO would stop expanding  It was so nice when it was just the arcadia location that was unique and tucked away  I ve now been into   of their locations and this was probably my least favorite  The atmosphere is nice  and the menu seems essentially the same as the others  For some reason it seemed like they only had about    beers to offer  If I remember correctly the original has like     and you can do samples  flights  ect  Maybe I didn t look hard enough  but I didn t see it   The wontons I ordered were extremely fishy and the sauce was way too sweet  I wasn t impressed  even for it only being     I decided to skip the main entree and go for sorbet  which was delicious  The only other issue I had was it sprinkled a little bit and we wanted to stay on the patio but a staff member  not our server  came out and practically demanded that we go inside  About    later we were stuck inside watching people get sat at our table and enjoying the beautiful weather   Some pros  big patio  plenty of parking  corn hole friendly staff  It was also only    for a pitcher of local beer on happy hour  Gotta love that  I probably wont be back to this location but I do love the original ,3,2015-05-06
Much better atmosphere than the other OHSO  The patio is huge and covered which is great for summer months  But just like the other location  the food is terrible  I ve tried a few things on the menu  none of which I would order again    drinks and an entree will run you      just say no to food here ,3,2016-06-15
Although I wish this location was closer to home  it s definitely worth the drive or bike ride to come here  Brunch specials are great  the food is great  the beer is great   there s nothing to complain about  The ambiance of this location is my favorite because you walk right into the outdoor seating which is great for groups with pets and or kids  The indoor seating is a little bit more intimate  but still very open and welcoming  My in laws fell in love with the chicken and waffles the first time they visited and dream of it each time they plan a trip back to Phoenix ,5,2018-01-25
First time here while on vacation from New York  Loved it   They have misters everywhere so you re not dying in the heat  They also have corn hole and ping pong  Great atmosphere and a great hang out spot to grab a drink  Definitely recommend ,5,2018-07-02
Hubby friends   I all enjoy drinking and socializing here We started at the OSHO in Scottsdale  thats a great brunch     We ve also hit the centrally located OSHO They all have great food  The PORK wings      craft beer Each place has a slightly different vibe  and that s OK   This location in PV is great for outdoor seating  games and dogs  ,5,2016-11-02
Great beer but service is meh and the fact that we were essentially booted out of our table    servers approached to advise the table was reserved at       minutes prior is a bit over the top  Will take business elsewhere ,2,2017-07-08
This is a regular place for us to go  especially when there s friends family in town  We ve been going to OHSO since they had the original location just open up in Arcadia  so when they opened the huuuuge PV location  we were psyched  You can t go wrong with anything on their menu  but we usually go for burgers  pink  and fries  They have a TON of local state brews  so if you re coming from out of town you can try a bunch of them all in one place  They also make their own vodka and gin if that tickles your fancy  Oh  and they re DOG FRIENDLY  We take our Sheltie there as often as we can  and if we don t bring him  we bring him a homemade beer spent grain   peanut butter dog treat to make up for it  BRUNCH deals can t be beat here either   they have entree and a beer or mimosa for only        Only one bad thing to say  though  DO NOT go on a Sunday evening   they have the same dang cover band playing the same dang covers so we usually go to Arcadia or Scottsdale to avoid ,4,2018-08-29
We thoroughly enjoyed the food  drinks  and bartender here  The whiskey and beer list is phenomenal  The cocktails are okay  The blue crab dip is amazing ,4,2016-02-15
Amazing kale and pear salad  I added blackened salmon and the whole meal was on point  Aaron our server is a cool dude with great service  Thanks guys ,5,2016-04-17
New favorite in our neighborhood  Always great food  awesome selection of beer and cocktails  The staff here is also really wonderful and you can tell they like what they do  Perfect place for casual friendly happy hour ,5,2018-08-28
My friend and I almost missed this place and went to paradise bakery  Thank goodness  we stopped in for the     beer and brunch before our baby shower destination  We shared the Avocado toast   the Monte cristo both were huge portions and delicious  In addition  after a couple of their house brews we were set  Great atmosphere  dog friendly and bean bag toss to add to the fun  We ll be back,4,2017-01-07
Great food  Love the dog friendly patio  Activities to keep the kids busy  Great place to take a large group  Really  the only bummer about this place is the wait during peak times  Other than that  we love it ,5,2018-09-15
I am a first timer from out of town  visiting family  We were in the mood for burgers and decided to stop by because it is close to home  We had a great experience with great  friendly staff  We were greeted at the door and was told we would be seated right away  The waitress was kind and attentive  The food was amazing and just as we imagined  we had the BBQ Burger and the Green Chili Burger  They have a cute patio area with heaters and games  but we decided to sit inside  I would definitely recommend to stop by if you need a quick bite or if you re ready to stay and watch the game ,5,2018-12-15
Bring your four legged furry friend  dog  and your family  all ages   This place accomodates everyone  We sat on the patio furniture couches on the outside patio  There were outside heaters next to each table to keep you warm in the winter  but I recommend wearing layers because if you aren t up and moving around  you are likely to be cold   The good news is that there are lots of opportunities to get up and move around  There are several ping pong tables  cornhole games and a giant Labyrinth board game  It s metal instead of wood and on a raised platform that can be tilted to keep the ball moving though the maze without falling through a hole  The games are free  First come  first served   If you are coming during the summer  the outdoor patio is shaded from the sun and water misters spray water to keep you cool     If you prefer the comforts of regulated temperature  you can grab a seat at a pub table or booth inside  Despite how big this place is  there will most likely be a line at the door waiting to claim a place   Your pooch will enjoy the two large troughs of water on the patio  The trough water is refreshed by a fountain of water pouring out of decorative  beer taps     The service was phenomenal  We had a party of about    people show up     came for dinner and reserved   sets of facing couches  The wait staff regularly checked on us to bring food  refill drinks and clear the table   This  home away from home  serves elevated comfort food  I was told the brisket mac n cheese is  the thing  to order  Despite this recommendation from friends who dine here regularly  I ordered a grilled cheese with gouda and proscuito and grilled asparagus spears sprinkled with parmesen   It was fantastic finger food  The margarita with Chambord  rasberry liquor  on the bottom was both delightful to look at and drink   I thoroughly enjoyed meeting a group of friends and their families here for a relaxing evening of socializing  food drink  and fun  I ll definitely be back ,4,2015-12-31
Great food and drinks as well as a fun family friendly atmosphere  Went with a group of friends on a Sunday afternoon and really enjoyed it  Plan to go back with the wife and kids in the near future ,4,2016-05-04
This OHSO location offers a great weekend brunch deal with selected items including a beer or mimosa   There is a large amount of outdoor seating as well as a good amount of indoor seating depending on your preference or if you are bringing your canine friend s    The staff are all very nice and friendly and provide excellent service along with great recommendations depending on your meal choices   Just because they have a special menu with what you might consider cheap eats  don t think they will skimp on the portions because they do not   So far everything sampled on the menu has been delicious and quite filling   Drink wise  they offer a large selection of house beers as well as local guest brews on tap and bottled varieties from out of the area   So if you are looking for some place to have a nice breakfast or brunch with your friends  including the four legged furry kind   I highly suggest OHSO in Scottsdale   If you have rug rats  they also offer some play areas on the patio for them as well ,5,2016-06-12
GREAT atmosphere      Very busy  they only take reservations for    or more but it s a great environment to wait for your table  excellent food  I had the kale chicken salad  Excellent     The burgers looked amazing and fries were crisp  Great place for happy hour  brunch  din   I ll def go back    ,5,2015-05-13
Love this one out of all the   locations the best  Although  each one is unique and has special qualities  I do love what they ve done with this place  It s a perfect combination of everything a brewery should be ,5,2015-07-09
What s not to like about OHSO  Great beer  great food and a fun atmosphere  Even better  They have a solid vegan menu that features a delicious burger   the Arcadia Veggie Burger  I ve never had another patty like it   it s somewhat thin  which I prefer  and very  meaty   It may be mushroom based  and I hate mushrooms  but I don t see mushroom pieces  or taste them  in it so I just pretend it isn t  The bun is delicious   slightly sweet  and it s served with guac  pico and lettuce  It also comes with some of the best fries in town  If you are vegan  stress to the server that you don t want the OHSO sauce  I ve had it served twice with the non vegan sauce due to kitchen error  It s a large burger so it s enough to share  maybe while splitting the delicious kale pear salad as well    On the non vegan side  my most recent dining companion had the Mac Del Mar and loved it  Other friends have enjoyed the burgers   The restaurant also offers a variety of gluten free options  so it s a great place for anyone that has specific dietary needs  It s very family friendly  The outdoor seating is great for when the weather isn t unbearable in Phoenix  but can get too warm in the summer  Inside cooler  but can get very loud  It s not the place for intimate conversations   In addition   I ve rarely had bad service here  only once  years ago   The servers are very knowledgeable about the menu  and are attentive without being intrusive  I did have one sit down and chat with me about vegan food while I was waiting for a friend  which was fun  He also made sure the happy hour appetizer I ordered  Thai peanut hummus  was fully vegan ,5,2018-03-30
I love the atmosphere and it s my dogs favorite place to hang out but the food and beer are just a B ,4,2016-10-11
Been here twice so far  Atmosphere is fine  a bit urban inside  big dog park on the patio  My biggest con for a place is not enough air conditioning which I thought existed here because their front door is open at all times to the patio   I tend to get hot easy   The food is good   at least the one dish I ve tried  Brisket Mac and Cheese   Dish is unique  tasty and big portion  Only downside is it is so rich  eating more than half is impossible   Biggest con of this place is their service   Some of the poorest service I ve had in a while and the main reason I did not give a higher rating  The first time I went  our young    something server was the PITS  Did not really greet us  lackluster personality  We had to insist on giving our food order  my friend had to ask   times for her speciality beer before it arrived some    minutes after we were seated   We were there   hours for dinner because he was slow or absent for long stretches of time  Never asked us how the food was  Forgot my last coke  Didn t ask me if I wanted to order dessert even though my friend ordered  Just an incompetent server overall and this ruined the experience for sure     nd visit the server was a bit better  but the bar was set so low it wasn t hard to beat   nd visit though the hostess was a joke  Sour face  seemed socially awkward  and she s a hostess     very petite girl wearing an inappropriate tank top with a bit of a gut hanging out  Not impressed   I noticed on my  nd visit  which was a lunch visit so not as crowded in the restaurant  that the employees of this place just move at a snails pace  and no one looks even remotely happy to be there   Weird as the patrons seem pretty chill     So if you love dogs  decent food and don t mind bad service   this is your place ,3,2015-10-30
I flippin  love this place  The first visit was in June and we played corn hole while downing tasty brews   The following visits have been for dinner s      The staff is knowledgeable  food tremendous  cocktails creative  and vibe amazing   I ll be back soon ,5,2015-07-22
I come here at least once a week during the week for the great happy hour and amazing atmosphere  It s a great place to bring the kiddos and the dogs  I m never let down by excellent customer service  Everyone is extremely nice and happy  Food and drinks have never been a let down ,5,2015-12-01
I loved this place  Nice staff  great food  I had the AZ burger and it was incredible ,5,2018-11-24
Loved the food  The ladies restroom needs some maintenance  Pricing could use some fixing and the servers could be friendlier ,3,2017-05-21
This is a great place for drinks and games  The ambience is fun and unique with many dogs on the patio The food left a lot to be desired though  All of the   entrees ordered in my group were bland  mushy  and seemed to be sitting for a while ,2,2016-05-27
You know what I hate  Cold fries  These fries were PIPING HOT  The AZ Burger    Delicious  Our server   fantastic  We ll be back ,5,2017-07-22
As a frequent patron of this establishment  tonight  you get   star  If I could give you negative stars  I would   Came in tonight  around  pm  pretty slow so one would think service would be great  Just not so   In all the times we ve been in this was by far the worst ever  I m giving you this review for your poor service  The beer is good and the food is good  Service   terrible  Management   terrible   We waited longer than normal to order  again  remember it was slow  I thought maybe they were actually making the pitcher of beer we ordered  Ordered food  took    min to get and it was wrong  Promised it would be out  quickly   scary when it s chicken  Took forever again so we had to get it to go  It s now       and I finally got to eat     The manager  took a pitcher of beer off our tab  Are you kidding me  You have people that are clearly annoyed and have waited now   hour for food and you give them a free pitcher of beer  If we weren t so hungry we d have left and not gotten the food at all   Not one to ask for anything free but I know for a fact it wouldn t have been much for them not just say  hey  we messed up  we value you as a customer  tonight s on us   OHSO  know who your regulars are and do something about your service and management  We love your beer but won t be eating there for awhile   How many apologies does it take from a server for management to make it right and maybe  just maybe  address your patrons that just had a bad experience   You failed us  so disappointing ,1,2018-12-15
Although it s a Sunday and busy I m very disappointed this location doesn t have the NFL package    they only get the local games you can get on your own T    which go a sports bar is surprising   I m here only because I didn t want to cook breakfast     which they now have a     or     option    which both are a pretty good deal  The problem with the breakfast is the scrambled eggs     so I m thinking it s basic quality and not actually eggs    another problem is the toast comes out untoasted on one side and not buttered at all    good luck trying to get butter  The bacon and mimosas are good  The problem with service is that when I arrived there was one gal working the whole bar    not sure if others were on a break or what     then    minutes later a guy shows up walking around cleaning dishes    and he actually took a few drink orders    now there are two gal s doing the bar     I m confused as to who gets my tip now    so it s obvious n I think gonna be      I would say if your looking to try beers and hang out with only appetizers and light eating afair then this would be perfect ,2,2015-11-22
OHSO has a few locations  and the Paradise Valley location is my favorite  It is much more open and cool during the summer  than the north Scottsdale location  and I have had more consistent and friendly service at PV than the Arcadia location  I tend to order the same thing each time  the Az burger  Go  Try  Now  Yum   I also recommend trying some of the OHSO beers  I ve been pleasantly surprised by many of them  but I really love their morning brew  Go have fun  drink some beer  and play some bags    It s always fun ,5,2016-10-04
Ohso is by far my favorite brewery in town  They have some of the best beer I have had and always have great seasonal beers   I do miss the Orange Pale though that needs to make a return   Ohso has such a great environment and always full of good people  Don t forget to grab a bite to eat when you are there too  the food is awesome  They have an amazing brisket mac n cheese  The staff is always friendly and ontop of their game  We had Hayley behind the bar the other night and she was fantastic        Great neighborhood bar ,5,2017-10-24
I like this place  I really do  I like that my   year old can come and play  that it s outdoorsy  and there s fun stuff to do  I come here somewhat frequently for that reason  But the food    ugh  And maybe it s because I get brunch but the food always seems to be served after it s sat out a while  And there s just not much flavor to it  So    I drown it in hot sauce and burn my taste buds off    Alas  I will continue spending money here  It s too nice of a place not to come back ,3,2016-05-06
I don t see the appeal of any of the OHSO locations  but PV seems to be the least welcoming of the three nearby   There s always a ton of staff working  but none of them seem to remotely look like they want to be there   There s a few highlights on the food menu  but the beer is nothing to write home about ,2,2018-12-09
I was so excited about this place opening  and the environment is pretty cool  except for horribly behaved children no one is slapping   I know its a new staff  but surely they had a lot of applications to choose from  and the service was some of the worst ever  Unprofessional  slow  food didn t come out  ever  drinks were slow or didn t come  Then I had to tell the guy to comp the food that didn t come out off the check  and that took another    minutes   I m really hoping they can get better  and hopefully there will be enough drunks there that people will stop bringing their deranged little brats to a sports bar ,3,2015-03-27
Cool atmosphere  especially the outside patio areas  Service was just ok  nothing terribly wrong but nothing great  The first time we went about a year ago the food was amazing  but every time we have been back the food seems to be going downhill ,3,2017-07-21

Their chicken and waffles is amazing   Love that it s dog friendly  Can be slow service during rush  Don t try to rush through dinner here ,4,2017-08-05
I have been to the other two OHSO locations and this  is by far my favorite   Not only because it is only about a half mile from my house  I am one lucky girl     but the whole vibe of the place is so chill and relaxed and a place I could spend hours  My husband and I came on a Friday for lunch  and it was busy but not too busy  We sat outside and there was a nice breeze and a huge fan for the summer months   I m talking   feet tall  The food was delicious   I had the ensalada del sol and really enjoyed it  My husband had the regular burger and I had a bite and loved it  The bread was so soft  My MIL came previously and had the Chinese chicken salad and said it was really good  Happy hour for drinks is      M F  and you can get a small pitcher of beer for     That s about      beers  What a deal  Food specials are from     and then after    or        We did see some kids who were acting a little unruly   their parents were letting them play in the fountain and dip rocks into it  etc  I m not so mad at the kids as I am at the parents  I just think that s unacceptable  But the owners didn t try to stop them or say anything nor did anyone who worked there  so I figured if they were okay with it  then I didn t much care  We sat in the nice Adirondack chairs in the sun for a while and I could have taken a nap there  Really a great location and a great restaurant  I will be coming back ,4,2015-04-17
In town from San Diego for work and came in for some beer and food  First off the atmosphere and outside area is awesome  Ping pong corn hole and dog friendly  It s kid friendly as well    The service was fast friendly and they were on the ball  Beer and food selection was good  I had the Brisket Fries and they were bomb    Back to the beer  being from San Diego where we have outstanding local beer I appreciate the solid local beer line  up y all have  I will be back,4,2019-10-02
Great beer  good food and good service  The indoor and outdoor seating is unique and quant  This place didn t disappoint but didn t wow me to deserve a   star rating  You wouldn t be disappointed if you stopped in and I would definitely do back if I was in the area,4,2019-09-08
Jordan is the best bartender ever  Super sweet and accommodating  She makes awesome drinks and makes everyone feel welcome  It s too bad she doesn t work more often   I only come on her shifts ,5,2019-07-14
My first piece of advice for management is to hire employees based of qualifications and less on aesthetic  I ve been here several times and each time  I m either left waiting at the hostess stand for SOMEONE to acknowledge me  there has been more than one occasions where multiple employees are standing there  either ignoring me on their phones or just blank faced staring at me without any sort of greeting   The food is good enough and it s definitely got a nice atmosphere  and the service would warrant a four star review  but it s hard to get past that first impression that staff either just do not want to be there  or do not care ,3,2019-09-29
We stopped in after a hike at lookout mountain  The staff was super friendly and the food was great  There were plenty of activities to keep the kiddo entertained while we hung out  I would highly recommend  ,5,2019-03-10
This is a super neat establishment with indoor outdoor seating  is pet friendly and a cool place to hang out  My girlfriends and I swung by for their Late Night Happy Hour and I was pretty amazed by the amenities this place had to offer   I ordered Crab Wontons and the rest ordered Buffalo Cauliflower and a beer flight  Very light dinner  We sampled fruity beers and the Buffalo Cauliflower was good  I don t like cauliflower but the Buffalo sauce masked the taste of it   However  our waiter had to excuse himself because he wasn t feeling well  which was totally understandable  We were given a new waitress  only to find out they had forgotten about my order of Crab Wontons  When they finally came out they tasted OK  it was more of a fried wonton wrapper than anything so I won t be ordering that again   I d love to come back during the day time and try their brunch or their craft cocktails ,4,2019-05-09
Okay  since when did Yelp start figuring out where I ve been and get on me about writing a review   Spooky   Well  Yelp is correct   We recently had brunch on the patio at OHSO   It was my dog s first public outing with us  and part of his training program   Yeah  our trainer is awesome like that   Now I wasn t really sure if OHSO actually welcomes dogs  or they just don t kick you out  but yes  they do welcome them   There are some places to hook the tether and they provide water   The pups even got little packages of their dog biscuits   This human got a white sangria and the breakfast wrap   The sangria was really good  especially on these warm winter days   The wrap was good   I wasn t blown away  but I had no complaints   I was really impressed with the servers   By the time we left  there were dogs everywhere  and they managed to keep a smile on   We usually go to the Arcadia location  but this one is a nice alternative when we re in the area ,4,2017-01-25
First time coming here and the vibes where awesome  Great environment and amazing food  Plus you can t go wrong with a penny mimosa with a brunch purchase  Santina was our waitress and she was super friendly and sweet  Will definitely be coming back ,5,2019-09-08
Sorry guys  why after the last   years has your beer quality went WAY down   Don t let the people down who have supported local craft beer   ,2,2019-05-09
Hayley was incredible  She was so personable  She recommended the exact beer I would love  She also recommended the crab wontons which were to die for  except for the cream cheese  There was a lot of fucking cream cheese in those bad boys  but Hayley made it all better by her personality  and just her energy  I ll definitely be back  but only to the outside bar  if Hayley is there ,5,2019-06-05
Took a group of    there the morning before our    year reunion  Atmosphere was great  but the food was atrocious  It was honestly the worst brunch most of us had ever had  the bread underneath the Avocado Toast was unedible and three of us found a hair in our food  Unfortunately  we will not be going again ,1,2017-10-19
The brisket Mac and Cheese is worth the trip  It gets a bit hot with the open air concept but the fans help  They also have a yummy hummus platter ,4,2019-05-24
This is the third time I ve been here and I still have yet to find something to complain about  The staff is great and the food is greater  especially the brisket sandwich  brisket mac and cheese  and jalapeno polenta  They have a bunch of outside game like ping pong  corn hole  etc  They also have a full bar  outside and inside seating and accommodate dogs  free treats and their own water dish   This place is one of our go to restaurants ,5,2018-05-12
So a friend and I came for some lunch  and I have been here before but only at night  So this seemed like a good time to enjoy the outside  which apparently is a great spot to enjoy the weather and people watching as there are corn hole and other fun games to enjoy by all  Also having a dog friendly patio makes it extra enjoyable   I am a big fan of their brisket mac and I will admit to having ordered it almost every time I have come  But this time for lunch the chicken and waffles grabbed my appetite and I decided to give it a go  I honestly thought it would be good but nothing worth mentioning  I could not have been more wrong  It was seriously delicious  the portions was more then I expected  which was split between my friend and myself  the chicken was a little spicy and not overly breaded  it also came de boned which was a nice surprise  The waffle was warm and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside  The sauce that came on the side was a fantastic mixture of BBQ sauce and maple syrup and the bacon was cooked crispy and perfect  This was  in my opinion  better the LoLo s chicken and waffle  I loved it and will be going back for seconds in the near future   The staff was also very kind  polite and attentive and never once waited for drink refills  satisfaction checks or the bill  They all worked together in an efficient and professional manner   This place has all the right ingredients for a fun place to bring friends  family and even the puppies  Don t miss out coming here day or night ,5,2016-11-17
I love Ashley and the other stylists  they are so friendly and welcoming  I feel like I m there to be pampered and not hurried  It certainly takes the stress out of  doing my own hair   I know it s going to look good when I leave Primp And Blow ,5,2017-07-01
Have never had a meal I didn t like here and the service isn t bad either  With that said  I ve yet to find something here I love or have really great service  as far as service goes though  they are busy  so it s not like I blame them   The atmosphere is neat  and of course  you cannot go wrong with a place that allows puppies  Great place to go to catch up with people just enjoy the atmosphere ,3,2017-06-14
We are regulars at OHSO  We really enjoy this place  the food  drinks  etc  The service is usually pretty good as well  But this last time requires an individual review  We went for a late lunch and adult beverage on Friday  Our server was Anthony  He was fantastic  the best we have had at OHSO  He was super informative  gave great beer advice  took amazing care of us and was absolutely adorable and charming   We will certainly return and will be asking for his section  I m sure the managers already know how great he is  but he deserves recognition  Cheers to you Anthony ,5,2018-09-23
Went in for a couple of mimosas and breakfast sat there quietly as the bar area filled    The lady bartenders were very nice and serving me unfortunately they didn t get a very big tip because of how this ended    while waiting for my check a belligerent ass came up and asked me to move over    I said no because I m waiting for my check   but this person proceeded to sit down and shove me and talk angrily loud at me   management did absolutely nothing    absolutely nothing     they actually took his side of course they would because management is a man and the person was an angry short man who shoved me off my stool because I wouldn t move over   seat    why should I if he couldn t wait   minutes    yep the man couldn t wait   minutes he demanded I move over and I wouldn t  This is the second time in several months this has happened sitting at the bar at this place  I ll never go back again and I hope this serves as a warning to all you who throw your money at this place just to get harassed by other customers who management will do anything to side with them and take their dollar   i m a quiet nonconfrontational person who was alone and got attacked and shoved just sitting there eating my breakfast  The customers and sometimes the staff are just as rude   who needs this when there are better breakfast and sports bars around the corner ,1,2017-10-08
My favorite place to eat in Arizona  Food is delicious and prices are reasonable  The patio is dog friendly so my dog loves this place  This is the nicest location out of the three  Love coming here ,5,2016-02-04
Food is good but eating outside is gross  I ll remember to only eat inside  Everyone brings their dogs there and there s dog hair all over the outside tables  Hair and food don t mix  Yuck,3,2016-02-27
We love this place and are here   to  x a week   It s awesome to be able to sit outside in this amazing Arizona weather   The bar staff are on top of their game    especially Destiny and Cale   Great selection of beer    The food is good  albeit a little pricey   It s such a popular neighborhood spot that we always run into several other Cocopah families   If you don t like dogs or kids you should probably go somewhere else   Fun live music on Sunday afternoons ,5,2016-10-16
I came across my negative reviews from a couple years ago and want to make sure I updated my review  I reluctantly gave this location another chance and I have now made this a regular stop  The service is always great and the food and drinks are always amazing ,5,2017-05-07
I love OHSO  great atmosphere  food and beers  I love that I can take my dog   One small speed bump is the fact that there,5,2015-10-26
Warming up in Phoenix but another great brunch at O H S O  Aaron was awesome  Definitely a must visit brunch spot in Phoenix ,5,2015-06-20
Great service with a decent happy hour   Food was excellent and the atmosphere was upbeat   Will be back,4,2017-09-02
Great beer selection  friendly staff  great place to bring your dog  Happy hour and reverse happy hour offer some great deals too ,5,2018-12-10
Its pretty striking how different each of the OHSO locations are when compared with each other   Arcadia has its great beach cyclist vibe  PV is a postmodern industrial picnic ground  and Scottsdale is    well  confused about what it is  or what it should be   As for the PV location  I was there on opening night  and wanted to hold off on reviewing the place until I had a chance to visit at least   times while they continued to work the kinks out   I m glad I did as they ve done admirably well   I generally try to stay away from the place during its extreme peak hours  and particularly to avoid the stampede of barely supervised children  and typically go on Thursday nights after    pm  so for the most part  I ve avoided all of the cluster     problems the place seems to have at peak times   When the place is running at     capacity  it really hums like a well oiled machine   The waitstaff gals are wonderful  food and beer orders come out very quickly and accurately   The   pm  menu is perfect for lighter yet satisfying  savory bites like the hummus and those excellent pretzels and cheese dip  and I m happy with the regular menu as well  think typical bar pub food  but with a little oomph  and panache    The patio design is quite an achievement    so much space   Parking is good  at least for now   but if they ever lose access to that lot just south of OHSO that belongs to the adjacent office park  then parking is gonna get complicated   Beer   good   The list can be a bit underwhelming considering the wide variety of drafts available at other local places  Cellars  Angels   but it compares favorably to most other local breweries in terms of total offerings   There is enough craft on the menu to satisfy any reasonable ale fan s distinct tastes  even when they run out of the more popular beers   Still  the current offerings do not seem to be on par with Arcadias  at least not as of June                  I only hold back the  th star due to my personal pet peeve    the occasional patio insanity as the million kids go into bloodthirsty mob mode during peak times when OHSO hits       capacity   Thats really not OHSOs fault  and its not really the children s fault  either  as the patio does resemble an attractive gaming area  albeit with heavy gauge sheet metal corners     Its the parents fault   PARENTS WATCH YOUR DAMNED KIDS ,4,2015-06-18
I met up with friends here at their suggestion  They have both and indoor and outdoor area  The outdoor area is dog friendly and has some lawn games you can play  The indoor area has AC    They have their beers on tap as well as other local brews  The servers are pretty good at recommendations if you aren t sure what to get   The menu seemed a little limited to me  I ended up ordering the pork green chile plate  don t recall its actual name  and it was decent but I m not sure I would get it again ,4,2016-08-10
Went on a Sunday evening at   PM and it was like a day care center gone mad with no adult supervision   Kids were running around  playing games  screaming  banging on ping pong tables with the paddles  and generally behaving badly   I guess the parents were enjoying not having to mind there kids   So if you need a place to let your kids run wild while you enjoy a beer this is the place for you   Funny thing was the few dogs present were the only things being supervised and not causing commotion   I can t believe the restaurant management thinks this is the type of environment they intended   But it must be OK with them because they aren t doing anything to change things   Maybe they are clueless on how to control things  or they are too busy raking in the cash from the sea of customers to care   And obvious from the amount of people there that some people  unlike our party  like the noise and kids   We quickly finished our beers and went to a brewpub for adults ,1,2015-03-30
I reserved my review until after I gave them a second chance   My wife and I love the idea of this place  because we can bring our dog and child   it s a fun atmosphere  and the food is good   Alas  we ve decided it will be a long time before we go back   Two visits ago  they warned that the kitchen was  a little backed up   We ended up leaving an hour after ordering  having received nothing we ordered   They were apologetic and told us the chef had recently quit   We went again this week   We ordered beer  an appetizer  an entree  and a salad  all to share   The drinks  appetizer  and entree eventually made it out  slowly  but we never got the salad   Had the waiter ever come by  we would have told him   By the time he finally checked on us  we were over it  and just wanted to leave   Again  they were apologetic  but that only works once ,2,2016-04-08
Scottsdale blonde and the brisket mac and cheese  Yeah it was good  I could have used slightly cheesier mac but I did smash  It was too much for one sitting and will be lunch tomorrow ,4,2015-10-16
This place has amazing beer  great bar food  and over the top service  I love the casual environment and the easy attitude  All the dogs are huge bonus  What a great place to come with kids  they have lots of games in spaces for them to run around  Great place to catch game on one of the many TVs  This is it one of my favorite neighborhood stops ,5,2017-12-09
This is a very cool local brewery   We went to hear our favorite local band   Sugahbeat  formerly Azz Izz Band  play out soon the patio   We have been following the band for years and the Sunday afternoon beautiful on the patio   We had some drink   a red beer for the hubby and a specialty cocktail for me   We danced  got thirsty and I had another cocktail while hubby went to iced tea   We had some yummy guacamole and chips   Quite good   We then ordered a meat  cheese and bread board that was great   Had prosciutto  olives  salami  cheese   Delish   The patio is quite charming with canopy and covered foam seats with rock accents   We danced like crazy out on the patio amid the games  kids and canine action out on the patio   It was a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon ,5,2016-06-12
Dog friendly people friendly great spot to hang out on the patio for the afternoon or evening   Play some games  grab a drink  pet some puppies  Perfect,4,2017-10-13
This place is awesome   So far the only other place I know like  this in the valley is the yard  This beats everything about the yard  I can bring my dog here and enjoy some beers in a grassy area where my dog can chill and meet other dogs  Our waitress is HILARIOUS we are having a great time,5,2015-03-23
The steak fries are to die for  there hummus is the best I ever had and the fact that we can always take our dog with us is aaaaaaaamazing  Fun place  weekends when they have live music  rush  lunch or dinner you will not be disappointed   C M,5,2017-05-02
Went here about during the Cubs World Series   I was interested in finding a place with a good burger where I could watch the game   This place was all of that and more     Very good burgers and healthy portion of fries   The kicker was the mini pitcher of beer   The perfect size for dinner and a good value of their local brew   Finally I have visions of visiting on one Sunday morning for brunch which was touted as legendary by some of the patrons I struck up conversations with   And yes the patrons are quite friendly so definetly a nice place to go to be social as well ,4,2016-12-28
Five stars  YASSSSSS  Our server was beyond personable and gave us a great recommendation on what to order  Fun vibe  Very busy    Highly recommend coming for the brunch special  Also  brisket mac and cheese is off da chain ,5,2015-08-09
This place is really fun  Love the bear and the food too  They have really delicious beer on tap  The people that work there are all friendly which makes for a funner experience  Ive taken a couple buddies there and they had a great time ,5,2016-10-19
Love OHSO    They pour the most generous mimosa in town for brunch and you can t go wrong with the     brunch deal   I ve had most items on the menu over the course of a few years but my favorites are the tacos  AZ burger  Mac Del Mar  the breakfast burrito and the Sunday luau   The vibe is awesome at the PV location plus you can bring your well behaved and friendly pups   Love that they also make dog treats    This is definitely a place we frequent often   The beer selection is also on point and I ve never left disappointed   Expect a wait on the weekends though  sometimes like    min    It s just that good ,5,2017-04-14
Been going to this location for a while  It seems lately things are going downhill  Stopped in last Sunday to have brunch  I ordered the biscuits and beer gravy  The gravy was ice cold and the biscuits were hard as a rock  My girlfriend food was the same way ,2,2016-06-30
Lively crowd  spacious area  great service  I love the pie hole porter as well as their array of craft beer selections  The vibe was good on a week night and a good amount of TV circulating around the bar to catch a game  No issues here   ,5,2016-01-29
Great place  Great food  Tremendous beer  Prices have gone up bigly  bad Arnold Palmer s  Low energy  Sad ,5,2017-04-28
Great  fun atmosphere for     anytime of the day   The people there always seem to be enjoying themselves  I know I do   The food is a little better than the  typical bar food  ,4,2015-08-31
This new location is nice   it has great outdoor seating  and I love that it is dog friendly  of course  The food is pretty good most times  my carnita tacos were a bit dry today   The beer selection seems to be limited than the original location  Weekend brunch at ohso is always nice   ,4,2015-09-29
Love this place    great beer  food  and atmosphere  And a good bloody Mary  It s a great place to take people who are visiting from out of town  and we will definitely be back on our own again ,5,2017-07-28
Great atmosphere  good service  and an interesting menu  The outdoor space is fun for everyone including families  Enjoyed and will return,5,2018-05-05
The atmosphere was nice  food OK  games were cool   but the service   a huge disappointment   We had a party of     and we were seated in an area where only   from our party were directed to a table that was an awkward distance from us where we couldn t hear each other   and it felt like we really weren t together  Not to mention     in our party had special needs handicaps  so it was important that we sit together   We noticed a table in another section that could accommodate all of us   and requested to sit there  To my surprise   our server   Amanda says    that section is closed    We said   well   can we add chairs to the ends of the table so we can sit together   She says    no    rudely    you can t put a chair there    Then   she has the nerve to say    you are just going to have to deal with it   you re not that far from each other   I was like  are you kidding me  My husband and I   and another friend at the table have been servers half of our lives   and we would never dream of speaking to a guest that way  She didn t want to accommodate us in anyway  The customer is always right  Even if a section is  closed   if a guest wants to sit there   they can sit there   Especially if they have special needs  as our party did  Really  a major disappointment ,3,2017-05-02
Super cool neighborhood spot   It s nice to have something like this close to home rather than making the trek into Old Town  Arcadia  Phoenix  etc   Servers are always friendly and accommodating   The microbrews are well above average and though I am usually ordering appetizers  I have zero complaints ,5,2017-05-17
Great gluten free menu  Friendly staff but you need to bring back the pork wings  They were the BEST  Or some other gluten free wings  PLEASE ,5,2018-10-31
The venue and restaurant concept was awesome    I wish we would have something like this in California  The reason I give this restaurant   stars was due to their service  Our waitress was friendly and all  but she lagged picking up plates  Our table was over crowded and none of the staff seemed to care even as they were bringing more food to our table  She also messed up our drinks twice  and tried to charge us the mistake drink  Maybe she was new  I don t know  but my family and I feel we didn t get the full  O H S O  Experience   Funny thing  if you order tacos  be ready to make them yourself lol     they will give you all the toppings and tortillas on the side ,2,2018-03-28
I am not a beer fan  far from a beer lover    but this establishment is amazing   Since I walked in  I got the Phoenix charm served through their staff and the people here  A very welcoming environment with outdoor seating  table tennis  dog friendly benches  If you bring your dog  they provide dog trays and write the dog s name on their water bowl  How cute is that  sit back and enjoy a beer with your dog next to you   We had just finished a hike at Camelback at bed were hungry and thirsty and order water to start  Our waters were tall big glasses and had a cucumber slice on top  I mean fee water being escalated to something much nicer  I ordered their spinach  strawberry and goat cheese salad  AMAZING      I also had the Gila Monster and then moved to a drink with gin and champagne   Best deal is their Mom Friday happy hour where you can get a pitcher for less than price of a drink on a normal day   This hips and cool spot falls on my lists of second date type place  Can not wait to return ,5,2017-01-14
I am very upset by the information your staff has provided to me  Yesterday I called your front desk to ask them how much is the growler for and what s the coat of filling it up  Person who answered the phone told me its    for growler and    for refill  I was amused by price I asked her can you please recheck and confirm it as I have to drive at least for    min to your place and I will be coming specially for this she said yes I confirmed its for     I reached their ordered   growler because I thought I am getting them for such a nice price  Now when bill came it was for      I was shocked  I told them I called your front desk before coming here and they told me its    for refill then I talked to girls standing in front desk and her response was  oh I got confused and told you     Really I drove for    min to pay so much  This is pathetic  no one can tolerate this behavior if you are giving me wrong information you should take responsibility of that why should I suffer   People who are standing on front desk  you should know about your place ,1,2016-06-04
Like so many other write ups I ve done  this wasn t my first visit to an OHSO Brewery  My first encounter was at the Arcadia location during one of our office happy hours  OHSO is a cleverly themed  local chain of brew pubs with one thing in common  They are popular  So popular in fact that parking is woefully inadequate  At the Arcadia location  they are crammed on a tiny little lot with next to no parking  But the Paradise Valley location has a huge parking lot that competes with a lot of other popular retailers  I circled the parking lot on a recent Friday evening at least three times before I found a spot back near the truck docks for the grocery anchor  Uber would ve been a good idea   To celebrate an early Mother s Day  I took my girlfriend and her daughter to OHSO  It was her choice and an excellent one  The vibe feels consistent with the charm of the smaller Arcadia outpost that I am more familiar with  Plus  I had no idea how dog friendly they were  There are pooches everywhere  And as an added bonus  there is a pet store next door so this shopping center could be a one stop shop for all your pet needs  If your pet doesn t mind you waiting around for one of their excellent beers   OHSO is pet friendly and kid friendly too  While we waited for our table  I grabbed some drinks and the three of us played games on their huge patio  It was a fun way to pass the time and it didn t feel as hot as it was  They have lots of fans circulating the air  I could honestly see coming back during the warmer months   Previous visits to OHSO involved drinks and appetizers  I can t recall what I ate previously  but I know I enjoyed the beers  This visit had similar results  We enjoyed our beers and the food was good  Not great  but pretty good  My girlfriend enjoyed her burger with Gouda and bacon and her daughter liked her mac and cheese  but it honestly looked like ordinary Kraft  My Green Chile Pork was not the best I ve had  It was a little on the mild side  We all enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken appetizer  in spite of the paltry amount of chips served with it  Our server Alana happily brought us more  She was busy this night  but she was always nearby and provided great service   OHSO is a unique place to hang out  It s large enough to bring a huge group of friends and also has an intimate feel if you happen to just bring one or two  Props to the  guest selection  of brews available  We plan to visit again soon to try their Beer Brunch options  Thanks guys ,4,2019-05-17
Great food and great service  The outside patio is huge and was awesome to see how dog friendly this place was  It was also a great surprise that they serve happy hour from the time they open until  pm each day  We ended up getting a pitcher of their Blite beer  American Pilsner  for only     Their burgers were also really good  the AZ burger is the way to go ,5,2019-02-26
I m am OHSO guy for sure  Before I forget they will let rescue groups host fundraisers and are generous in their support  Im involved in rescue and have met and spoke with Jon on mutliple occasions  great guy  Great food I love the brunch my dogs love it and the treats are awesome ,5,2018-11-29
First time here and I really liked the place   However almost all of our orders were wrong or missing something   It took a long time for someone to help us with the corrections and to get everything fixed   Hopefully next time it will be better ,3,2018-11-15
   people show up for a pre arranged happy hour at  pm today and these idiots make them sit outside in the sun when it s     and humid  Way to make a great first impression folks  Major fail  Never trust them with a group or expect them to provide real service ,1,2017-08-05
Love this location and set up  Food was great for Saturday brunch  We got the Cobb salad and carnitas bowl plus   different kids meals   Waffles  chicken tenders and grilled cheese  Lots of food for       Love how all the game areas are right by the seating so my son could play but still be near by   We will definitely be going back   Great place with or without kids ,5,2015-04-11
It s amazing just how much a good server affects your perspective of a restaurant  I went with a group of girls and we all said the same thing  My food  chicken and waffles  were quite good  I wasn t a fan of the spicy syrup which says a lot seeing as I have had the sriracha and red pepper flakes manually removed from me for fear that I was going to hurt myself  It s literally like they added hot sauce to syrup  not good  One of the other girls got the Fruity Pebbles French Toast and she said it was really good  not too sweet    My biggest complaint was that we went during ABC s animal support event and out server never asked if we were there to donate  nor did she inform us that our breakfasts came with a beer  mimosa or orange juice  Several of us were annoyed by this as we ordered different drinks  but would have gotten one of those options had we known we were paying for it anyways  She never checked on us for refills and at one point  brought out one of the meals a full    minutes before the rest of the food  Of course my friend wanted to wait to start eating until we got our food  it was really uncomfortable  Luckily we were able to grab the manager on our way out to make sure our bills were included in the donations  Maybe I ll check out the one in Scottsdale and see if there s a difference ,3,2016-11-15
My new favorite neighborhood spot  Great happy hour  HUGE patio  including dog run play area  with outdoor ping pong  labyrinth  bean bag toss and tons of tables misters  wicked laid back chill crowd and awesome staff   I think I found my Scottsdale version of  Cheers  ,5,2015-04-05
Great fun place with plenty of outdoor seating with fun games for everyone to enjoy  Food was good and some unique selections with some great burgers  The veggie burgers had lots of flavor and not the standard cardboard flavor most places serve  Maudlin Strangers the band on US tour   our guests loved the place  Executive Chef came out to visit and said they have served more guests than they imagined  The staff was doing a great job keeping up  We received a tour of the place and the soon to be ready brewery  I give it a   star for this type of restaurant  food quality and taste  price  atmosphere ,5,2015-03-15
This was my  rd visit at this location   Service is always on point  prompt and friendly    Food as well   Delivered in time  tasteful  and visually appealing    However  tonight was the first time ordering the guac and chips    First impression  overpriced   The amount equated to what I think was less than a cup   Normally that wouldn t be bad for PURE guac   This guac  though with good taste  is full of fillers  corn  bacon  pumpkin seeds   There is no possible way to pair each tortilla chip with some guac   The chips outnumber it   Would I order it again   Nope   Not for       ,4,2018-03-11
Love this place  Atmosphere is awesome  especially the outside area IMO   Never been disappointed in anything I ve ordered   Only complaint is I wish they took OpenTable reservations or Yelp waiting list  Sometimes wait times can be prohibitively long ,4,2018-05-15
It s difficult to give this place even one star  This was probably the worst service I have ever had  I was really looking forward to trying this place out   sadly  I m not sure if I ll ever go back  My friends and I were here to celebrate our friends birthday  When I sat down at the table  I ordered my beer and waited for about    minutes  Someone came out to deliver food  I then asked the person where my drink was  He said that he would bring me the beer that I had ordered  After waiting at least another    minutes  I still had not received my beer  Another waitress came by and asked if I needed a drink  I told her I had been waiting a really long time and I never got my beer  She didn t apologize or anything  she didn t even seem to care  About    minutes later my drink finally arrived  It s absolutely ridiculous that I had to ask three people for my beer and it took an hour for me to finally receive it  It was also a disappointing birthday experience for our friend who was really looking forward to celebrating here  We had reserved a table for     the waiter had specifically asked for our names when we ordered so that it would be easier to split the bill at the end  When the check came  nothing was split and our waiter was visibly frustrated with us when we were trying to figure everything out  I was willing to pay for my one beer  but my friend shared my frustration with the waiter and he asked her if my beer should be comped  I m not sure why he would even ask my friend that question  If this had been good customer service  my beer would ve been comped right away  The waiter also gave us attitude about how we did not stay in the same seat the whole time because now he was confused on who had ordered what  The only thing I liked about this place were the adorable well behaved dogs ,1,2015-05-17
The most AMAZING service from SAM  Rock star  Loved his attention to detail and loved that he knew all our names and was on top of it all ,4,2018-10-14
We live in San Diego  CA and our friend who s local took us this past Sunday while we were in town  We had the BEST time  Such a fun place to bring the family or go and have an adult day  Such an awesome place  They need to branch out to So Cal for sure  I bought a trucker hat and you can be sure I ll be wearing that bad boy with pride  Great brew  great food  great atmosphere  and super great staff  We ll def be back the next time we are in town ,5,2016-03-29
I love Ashley and the other stylists  they are so friendly and welcoming  I feel like I m there to be pampered and not hurried  It certainly takes the stress out of  doing my own hair   I know it s going to look good when I leave Primp And Blow            Dulce did a great job  it was very relaxing and my hair looked perfect ,5,2017-12-29
This place is way cool  First its a brewery  Second there is a bunch of big flatscreen TVs  And then you have bicycles hanging on the walls  Decent quality Floorstanding home speakers suspended in mid air with hip music being streamed constantly  Steel walls with magnetic words to move around to make your own sentences  A beer brewery you can mull  around looking at all the brewing equipment  Plus an open kitchen    I had a great burger with poblano peppers and cheese and instead of french fries I got to substitute a wonderful salad  The meal was served in an iron skillet  I loved it  although the meat could ve been a little less compressed so it wouldn t have been so chewy    This would be a great place to bring people from out of town or kids or groups  What are unique place   I highly recommend it ,5,2016-05-23
I have to say this is my favorite location  It feels the most spacious and has the most outdoor space  games  and my favorite patio of all the locations  OHSO in general is one of my favorite spots  you can t go wrong here  All of the food  from brunch to dinner  is amazing and the drinks are always on point ,5,2018-06-27
The food was average  The service was just awful  We only saw our waitress   times and because of the lack of any kind of uniforms we couldn t even find anyone who we thought worked there  Probably will never go back when Four Peaks is right across the parking lot and it s a much better place ,2,2015-08-24
Great atomosphere   Fun place to bring the family and friends and have a great time ,4,2016-06-07
I wanted to like this place  I can t decide which is worse the service or the food  We have been three times  Twice we went to the bar to get a drink while waiting for our table  We sat at the bar and were ignored by every bartender  We even said  excuse me  a few times trying to get someone s attention with no response after sitting for   minutes someone actually stopped and asked if we had been helped  Ah NO   Today at brunch we were seated at a table  but the server forgot my beer  Finally after I was half way done with my meal he looked at me and realized he forgot it  The server acknowledged he forgot it when he finally brought it  but a little late     As for the food  the first time we went  sitting at the bar  one person in our group did not get their meal and as described above it took a lot of effort to get someone s attention  The second time  the kitchen forgot to put the green sauce on the beaker sandwich and we never say the waitress again until she brought out check  Today at brunch the crispy potatoes  served with the quiche  were overlooked  like they had been under a heat lamp for several hours  and the  crispy  potatoes that came with the green chili pork were soggy from sitting at the bottom of the bowl which had an inch of liquid in it    It s a great space to hang out  especially if you have a dog  But I don t have a dog and hope this place is taken over by Four Peaks Brewery takes it over   They understand service and quality food ,1,2015-07-12
Went last night and had the Boom Dynamite and the pork wings   Beer tasted like it was made with a home brew kit  Pork wings were so so   over cooked and with too much salt   Place seemed busy though and very popular    don t know how I went wrong ,3,2017-05-06
unless your a drinker  the beer looks like its why people go there and the atmosphere but the food is slacking in taste  I assume they get you drunk and so when you eat you don t care because your just hungry  I ordered a jalepeno cream cheese burger  no flavor of jalepeno at all   One thing I didn t like is that I had about   different servers that had no uniforms so I had no idea who to ask for anything   Its a great place for younger crowd or social drinkers   but to get a good meal   not the place for me    Mind you im    and socialble but I don t drink       ,3,2016-01-04
What s not to love   Best food  amazing craft beer and distilled liquors and by far the best dog patio in all of Maricopa County    Great bartenders  fantastic wait staff  and clean bathrooms  OHSO is a must  ,5,2017-12-03
Great neighborhood spot  A bit pricey though  especially given the casual atmosphere ,4,2015-04-15
Nice place to bring your dog and have drinks  but the beers are pricey and the food is something less than to be desired   One gal in our group ordered a burger and it came RARE    and not in a good way   she was starving and tried to be a trooper  and ate what she could of it  but left the majority of it  since it was SO pink   Wow   pretty sad excuse   how can you mess up a burger ,3,2017-01-02
This is by far my favorite location   The staff and atmosphere is fun and welcoming  My son will play ping pong or sand bags while we wait for our food  I m a healthy eater and their salads are super fresh and love all the items they use pears or pecans  Most recently we were there and my son had a sticker for accomplishing something great at his school  The manager noticed and offered him an ice cream scoop for his achievement  I felt this really showed how the staff is involved with their customers  Love this place ,5,2016-04-23
Fun place  Super busy  Amazing drinks  I had the Summer Time and it was so refreshing  Cucumber vodka made this drink  I also had the White Chocolate Ale which quickly became a favorite  They have an interesting but delicious take on classic recipes  I would return  The only reason I didn t give it   stars was because our waitress took a very long time to give us our bill  Other than that it was perfect ,4,2017-07-23
Yum   Visiting from California and found this place last minute   The vibe is so fun and very family friendly   The drinks and food are outstanding   The chicken and waffles  pork belly  salads and sandwiches were awesome   The chicken and jalape o polenta were the best   Great homemade vodkas too   The service was in point despite a packed house   We all found the experience great and would definitely return ,5,2018-04-29
We are now big OHSO fans  Loved the atmosphere and the food was fab  Happy Hour all day until  pm ,5,2015-03-26
I love the patio  Great beers and food  This place is so fun and very dog friendly  This place is a must go ,5,2016-01-28
I am a HUGE OHSO fan so words literally couldn t explain my excitement when I found out one was opening less than a mile from my house    The new location is gorgeous  The outside area reminds me of a smaller version of  The Yard    corn hole and lots of other games  Cute little dog area with faux grass for the dogs to play on  Awesome fountain with water coming out of beer taps  The orange lanterns hanging everywhere are so pretty at night    Food and drinks were amazing as usual  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive  I am so bummed out they got rid of the flatbreads on the menu  I literally crave it and would order every single time  I hope they atleast keep the brunch flatbread  fingers crossed    Love the ambiance and everything about this place  Whenever I say  OHSO  my dog runs around in circles  So happy we will be able to walk to one now  Jon Lane you are awesome  The best one yet  Thank you ,5,2015-03-13
I m an OHSO regular and generally enjoy coming here  especially with my dog  Beer selection is great and there are at least a few of the dishes on the menu that I love  However lately there seems to be more and more uncontrolled children in the PV location    Some recent highlights  I saw a young kid grab a big rock from a gravel area proceed to etch the concrete in the main seating area with his drawings  The staff just looked at it and let him continue  as did his parents    Lots of kids running and ignoring the  no running  signs  parents seem to be oblivious to the fact that this place is very dog friendly and running gets dogs worked up  hence the signs    We tried to play cornhole last time but little kids kept running through the throwing area and even grabbing our bags  throwing rocks at the cornhole boards  etc  It is difficult to concentrate on throwing your bag when kids keep darting through the game area    One couple seated next to us had a toddler that was shrieking loudly  that kind of ear piercing shriek that makes you cover your ears because it s so loud  The parents just cooed at him and let him continue  as the other diners angrily glanced their way   Two kids at the ping pong tables were bashing the paddles on the metal tables over and over  not even playing ping pong  This is actually quite loud and annoying  The parents didn t seem to care   One toddler came up and stole someone s beer menu  and proceeded to crawl around with it in his hands  his father seemed to encourage this and did not bring the menu back to the table it was taken from   Maybe my problem is with the parents  not the staff  I just want to remind other patrons that this is a brewery where adults go to drink  not a daycare  Hopefully the staff can step up and at least enforce the rules a bit   I come to OHSO to relax  eat and drink  not to help raise someone else s kids ,3,2018-07-17
Friendly staff  good non traditional bar brewery food   Try the Green Chile Skillet   Gluten Free options food wise  which are pretty tasty   I don t drink beer so can t speak GF for beer ,5,2018-08-31
Amazing brews  bloodys  and burgers  My go to bar for any occasion  Plus  they allow dogs on the patio,5,2017-08-02
I m a little torn   I love their Hayden location   The food was pretty good   Service was ok  don t know if it was because we had a large group  about    people  some items made it to the table fairly fast  others took quite a bit   I liked my grilled cheese sandwich   My girlfriend had a soup and she said it was good   I have been here three times now  however I only come to this location if someone else has already picked it   For me it feels a little cold  maybe because it is pretty large   I am sad they don t offer the Scottsdale Blonde anymore ,3,2017-01-06
This place is amazing lots of seating in their very cool outside area  They Just opened so they are slammed  expect a wait  Sat at the bar had a great experience great beer  great food  and Kieth our bartender server is awesome  So happy this place is right around the corner  Will definitely  be back to try more beer and food ,5,2015-03-20
This was our second trip to the new location   First time was for a lunch on the patio with our dog  Beautiful day  good food good beer  Only problem was a couple of kids that lacked parental supervision  Tonight the place was  packed and apparently the entitled scottsdale parents come here to turn their undisciplined kids loose on innocent patrons trying to enjoy themselves  The food was good  the drinks were great  the weather wonderful    In case those parents recognize themselves   they won t   mcdonalds has a kid friendly place ,3,2015-03-20
Cool vibe  This place is to drink and hangout  The food is decent enough to get you through the night  Super cool patio ,3,2016-01-19
Food is good  Wish they had a wider selection  I feel like the Arcadia location has more food options  This is definitely my happy hour go to though  Always a great and rotating selection of beers  ,4,2018-03-23
I love this place  Dog friendly patio with games and spacious  Food is great and I love the     brunch that comes with a beer or a mimosa  Our server Cody is awesome too   ,5,2015-06-20
Great new neighborhood brewery   Food is fabulous   Luv the veggie burger   Lots of children and dogs so if you are ok with that it s a hot spot  ,4,2015-04-07
Excellent veggie burger  great fries  good beer selection and outstanding service ,5,2018-01-05
We had a great time  The food was good and the atmosphere was fun  It s close to home and everyone was having a good time  Special thanks to the hostess staff  Thank you  Jillian for making our meal more enjoyable ,5,2015-11-11
Always enjoy coming here for burger and beer on weekends  It is a great atmosphere and love the fact that I can bring my pet  I always get great service at the bar  The bartenders are very friend and can always strike up a great conversation  Love the food choices and beer selections ,5,2016-06-20
We have only gone for brunch but it has ALWAYS been super delicious  The biscuits   beer gravy  and the pork wings are sooooo good  We love the atmosphere  good place to bring the kids  the patio is so comfortable  even on a hot day   Seeing all the cute doggos is a huge plus too  Definitely come on by  You won t be disappointed ,5,2018-05-13
Very cool and fun place  I d been to the one in Arcadia and the one in North Scottsdale  all   star experiences  This one has a great outdoor area and we decided to sit out there and enjoy it  They had huge fans and misters    you couldn t even tell it was a hot day in Az  The food and service were great  There was live music that wasn t overly loud  The whole one there is so great  I love OHSO and recommend it to anyone who hasn t tried it ,5,2018-06-07
Really cool  happening  dog friendly atmosphere but food is not that good at all and the place smells like a burger s king kitchen  and so do your clothes and hair when you leave,2,2019-06-14
We d been before   Friday   New menu   The surf   turf had way too much salsa  the skillet looked disgusting and was too sweet  the pilgrim had a small bit of sauce that was too sweet and boring and the fries were barely warm   Come on ,2,2015-10-03
Bar none one of my favorite places to eat and drink in the entire Phoenix valley   I ve been to OHSO s countless times and the food  drinks and service are great and best of all    consistent  Want to buy their distilled spirits  Unfortunately  only at the North Scottsdale location  This place is neck and neck with Four Peaks Brewery and let s just not hope they too get bought up by the Man  Anheiser Bush  and ruine our local niche ,5,2017-10-14
Gave OHSO a second chance and had a MUCH better experience  My girlfriends wanted to do dinner here for a Christmas gift exchange  Our server was cool and attentive  I ordered a beer and the Mac Cheese  SO GOOD  super satisfying  worth the calories  Maybe since they have been open a little longer  they are more in sync  Or maybe my first visit was just an off day  However  I am definitely more excited to come back than I was after my first visit  Thanks ,4,2016-02-03
Yummy food and awesome selection of quality beer  This location is huge and has a great outdoors area  Happy hour is amazing  So are the fries ,5,2019-11-21
Very good food  Very understaffed and needs more personable welcoming people  Menu is limited and priced okay has potential ,3,2018-12-05
I love the food and the beers are awesome     Unfortunately our service was awful  We had four different people serving our table yet it somehow took    minutes for us to get our drinks    On a really slow night  Not worth going back and spending another    bucks to be ignored by every server,2,2015-08-24
Came here late night for a drink and a snack since it was close to my hotel  I love the design of this place  it s so big and open  I got a gin martini and it was great  but my mom didn t like her mojito  it had an unusual ingredient in it that is not found in traditional mojitos  My mom got chips and guac which were good  and I ordered a plain grilled cheese  not listed on the regular menu  and fries  It s hard to mess a grilled cheese up but it was just ok  it was soggy and not a lot of cheese at all  and the skinny fries were not hot and didn t have good flavor  The servers were very nice but slow service  it was hard to get their attention    I would potentially give this place another try when I m in the area and order something different  The French onion burger sounded good ,3,2019-05-20
The steak and fries is delicious  It s a very simple dish  but really well done  The array of taps for beer is great too ,4,2019-10-14
Food not good  Got a bbq burger and blt both just eh   Beer selection is pretty good  however  Clean place ,2,2016-05-27
Had breakfast here for the first time   Food was amazing  samples were ALL delicious   Andrew made our morning   We have been back twice since then   Andrew has been the best waiter  he always has great suggestions   The food is all delicious     Bartender Jeanette is amazing     We decided to make OHSO our once a week date night       D G,5,2016-05-16
First time the service was great  During my second visit I sat at the bar and waited for like for    min and ended up leaving because the bartender had zero awareness to look up and see that   new people had sat right down in front of him  No greeting   No nothing  it was barley anyone in there   I enjoy the Arcadia location since it s not overrun with children  Whats up with the parents in AZ that bring their Kids to places like this and The Yard  So much alcohol is around and the kids are running wild and unattended  It s pretty much like being at a Chuckie Cheese    Someone please reinvent this concept and make it    and up ,2,2015-05-11
This place is great for doggie playdates and beer  but the food is meh at best  The bacon is soggy EVERYTIME  The avocado toast is        and its always doggy and the  potato hash  is really just frozen hashbrowns with a light sprinkling of peppers that aren t even cooked together  It s a fun place to go to play a few outfoor games if you don t mind the heat  But definitely not the best place for brunch ,2,2018-09-30
Since I moved to Arizona  bout five months ago now  this place has become one of my regulars  I don t frequent it as often as I like  but when I do I make sure to have some friends co workers tag along  and they rave about it afterward  too   This OHSO s got something for everyone that s a fan of good local brew  lively patio atmosphere  or an inside bar to catch the game  Cornhole  ping pong  and plenty of seating with fans blowing it is AZ after all  in the patio that gives the kids family something to do and also allows dogs too   When it comes to drinks  so far I ve been a fan of the house or local AZ brews they serve  Didn t have one that I didn t like so far  Of course  they got your more popular domestics imports too   Food is pretty good too  I recommend the brisket mac and cheese for starters   My only small gripe is it s location as it s tucked away in the back of the plaza on both Tatum and Shea entrances  A bit hard to find when trying to rendezvous with first timer friends or family   But  as a rendezvous for an outing or getting some brews going with the friends or fam  I give OHSO PV two thumbs up ,4,2017-10-20
Really good food  Fun atmosphere great for all ages  Cool that a lot of people bring their dogs  I had a burger and my wife got a salad both were great  They have fun free games to play too ,4,2018-02-08
Hubby and I are in from out of town and wanted a good brew  I m glad we came here  Beer selection is great and the beer itself was delicious  Great service  The food seems a bit expensive  but trust me the portions are large  And very good  So glad we came  ,5,2017-07-01
Great chill spot to dog watch  Burger was on point   chicken   waffles were over the top  Our waitress even included extra syrup in my to go box without asking  Bloody Mary was good  not sure that it was     good tho  My one complaint is they forgot the fruit as my side  Highly recommended ,5,2017-01-17
Good food  good beer  shitty music the whole time  Like seriously  it was a horrible playlist all night  Overall an awesome place to check out though ,5,2015-10-15
GREAT FOOD  Love this place  Great atmosphere for    year olds or for families  Only downfall   expect to wait over   hours to eat dinner here on a weekend after  pm ,5,2015-05-18
This is a pretty cool place   Good vibe   This time  I got the Mac del Mar   it was really good   mac and cheese with shrimp  the del Mar part   jalape o chunks  and some grated cheese  crust  on the top that added a bit of crunch and texture to the dish   it was really tasty and well balanced   My friends got the Skillet  and the Grilled cheese   both enjoyed them   Only knock is the price       person for lunch is a bit spendy   maybe lunch portions for a lunch special ,4,2015-07-18
Ive been to the one in Arcadia So I m trying this one out  Im not a IPA or Hoppy guy Im a Newcastle loving ale guy and    ale is the closest to a decent smooth ale  its not Newcastle but the      will do   Wasnt in the mood to eat and if i was the tacos or brisket mac  which I ve had before are great  Lots of space outside,4,2018-12-16
The beer and burger was great   We sat at the ouside bar which was cool except the bartender seemed liked he didn t like his job  Lot s of kids   ,3,2016-03-22
I had a large group of family and friends in town for my wedding and needed a place that could easily accommodate    people for Sunday brunch  I made a request online  they quickly responded that they had room for us and I was good to go  Didn t need a credit card  it wasn t a hassle or anything  They called the day before to confirm and that s all I needed to do   We showed up on Sunday morning and our tables were all set   even had waters already  Our server was super friendly  getting everyone drinks and menus right away  Even though we were all chatting  moving all over the place and ordering at different times  she handled it with ease  Our food came out quickly and everyone said their food was delicious   I had the avocado toast and it was great   And it was no problem to do separate checks   The atmosphere was fun and the tables were shaded and cooled by big fans  which was great for my visitors who are not used to the warm temps here   Overall they made dining with a big group easy breazy  I m so glad I chose OHSO for my brunch and would definitely go back ,5,2017-04-29
  stars for ambiance  This place is huge compared to the other OHSO locations and has a bunch of backyard activities a la The Yard  Fooseball and cornhole  Dog friendly area is nice  Laid back and not crowded on a weeknight after  pm      stars for food  I really wish they had better food  Also they only serve pretzels during happy hour which I don t understand why I can t order them during any other time    The food is mostly good for pairing with beer  meat and cheese heavy  not a lot of fresh ingredients  kind of bland   I would aim for the burger or the Mac and cheese with pork which are pretty tasty      stars for beer selection if you like local beers ,4,2015-05-07
Tonight was my first time going to OHSO and it was amazing     The environment was very fun and uplifting  A lot of other people had their dogs with them outside and the weather was perfect  I love the fact that we can bring our dogs to dinner with us  My dog is a rescue with severe separation anxiety  so this is a great option being able to take her with us when we leave the house  The waiters waitresses were so nice   Our waitress babysat our dog while I took my   year old daughter to the bathroom since doggies can t go inside  how sweet is that    the food was so so good    I had the veggie burger with sweet potato fries and my daughter had the mac n cheese  We shared the apple pie with ice cream for dessert  I ll definitely be back   Such a great time ,5,2017-03-16
Absolutely love this place great place for family and your little dog  We love going here because the kids and the dogs can come enjoy the day out  The steak fries are the bomb and I love their humus  We have always had great food  Service is a little hit and miss but the food is fantastic  Live the beer choices too and being able to taste the beer prior to purchase is awesome  We try to go at least a few times if month yummulous  ,5,2016-01-29
I ve been to all three locations  and PV is my favorite  The outdoor patio has a fun atmosphere  Bring your dog with you  It s a good place to bring families too  Good beer and food ,4,2015-09-23
Went here for drinks while watching football at the bar  ordered a vodka sour came out great had a second one from another bartender that was awful  After one sip i asked the guy if he could make me another one or if their was anything he could do about it  Nope  all he said he could do was charge me more to fix the aweful drink he made for me  To me thats poor service ,1,2015-11-15
It s not often that I will write a review but this my yelp friends is very deserving  Tonight we ordered a bunch of thing such as the steak fries  hummus  and a salad  We found a hair in   of the   dishes  It didn t seem as though it phased anyone we mentioned this to  We have been to other location as a number of times without any issues     Thank goodness for beer     ,1,2015-04-11
The food was fine but I didn t have a nice experience at all for two reasons   First  upon entering the restaurant  we were practically felled by four little boys running outside to fetch a ball they had been playing with in the restaurant outdoor area   There is a  no running  sign but I wouldn t expect little boys to see or observe it   Second  we ordered appetizers for a table of four and received them along with only two plates   I saw the hostess and asked her if we could get two more plates   She replied   You ll have to ask your server   I am the hostess     So maybe she could have summoned a server since one was not in sight    I think hostess s attitude bugs me the most   She was haughty  in my opinion   There are so many great brewery restaurants that we would probably try another one next time ,3,2018-01-10
Great place for weekend brunch with a dog or two or three      brunch with a beer and the food is definitely nothing short of excellent   Popular place so expect a wait on the weekend   but game it up with cornhole and other games  a beer while you wait  or the social climate that OHSO provides ,5,2015-10-17
This is one of my favorite go to places for happy hour  They always have a fantastic selection of craft beers on tap and the food is decent  They have a solid selection of burgers  that while not the best in town  they are head and shoulders above the other breweries  They also have one of the best dog friendly patios in town  and it s a great family friendly place with lots of games and space for the kids to run around ,4,2018-07-26
I had never been  but I chose OHSO to celebrate my birthday  a few months ago   Huge mistake  I had a large group  but I made reservations in advance  I ll spare you all the specifics but the server was beyond rude  the drinks we re slow to come out and the food was less than mediocre    My biggest problem was that I submitted a lengthy complaint through the corporate website  I explained the whole situation from beginning to end  What I got in response a very short and generic reply from their manager Nick  He promised they could do better and he wanted to send gift card for me to give them another shot  I said sure  gave my address and waited a few weeks  NOTHING  So I emailed Nick back checking on his offer  He said he was out of town and that he would be getting that to me shortly  Now here we are more than a month later and still nothing  Obviously their management doesn t care to deal direct  so I am now choosing to write this review    I would never return ,1,2015-07-29
Cool dog friendly place   Waitress knew us from last visit  Good food and wonderful beer I ll  be coming back for sure and bring my wonderful dogs to enjoy this dog friendly place ,5,2015-08-01
Really good pizza  Roasted veggies wonderful  Can t share a picture because we ate it to fast ,5,2018-08-21
Would give it zero stars if I could  Every time I ve been here  there are kids EVERYWHERE    Even in the bar  It s like an after hours daycare  Stay away until it s bedtime for the little ones  Recommendation to the owner  follow Zipp s example   make the bar    and up  Recommendation to parents  get a babysitter,1,2015-06-27
We just tried out OHSO for the first time and I was rather impressed  I got the Fruity Pebbles French toast which is huge and really good  My husband got the biscuits and beer gravy and says it was delicious  My daughter got the kids French toast and gave it two thumbs up  When you order brunch you get a mimosa or a select beer for   cent  My daughter wished they had a kids fruity pebble French toast  but she actually didn t care for the lemon in the adult  that was literally the only thing any of us didn t care for  I can t speak for the beer because I m not a beer fan  my husband found some that he liked  but our server  who I think was Steve  tried his hardest to find me a beer that I would like  something that has never happened  and actually found two that I didn t feel like I was forcing myself to finish  The atmosphere is really laidback and cool  plenty of games to entertain guests and even an area for dogs  We will definitely be back ,5,2018-01-20
Love sitting at the bar on Sundays for the brunch  Who can beat   penny mimosas or beer with the meal  Breakfast wrap is great  try it with a side of pablano aoli  Has a nice kick to it and the side of fruit has always been fresh  Monte christo is top notch as well  Burgers are a little pricey but descent  Servers at the inside bar have been great  Great place to watch a game ,4,2018-03-09
Best dog friendly bar in Phoenix  and it s pretty human friendly as well  Came here yesterday and there were like    dogs here at a time  one of them was a puppy wiener dog that the owner let run around and everyone was just hoping to pet it  The food here is good I got the Mac del mar I think it was called  which is like Mac and cheese with bacon  crab  and scallops   it was delicious  As for their drinks I was not a big fan of their twist on the Moscow mule because it was too spicy  too much ginger  but did love their shandy drink which is a beer mixed with vodka and an orange  Oh and they have games here like cornhole aka bean bags depending on where you grew up  and the ball in a maze  not even sure how to describe it  basically a square and one person on opposite sides try to move a ball through a metal maze by tilting it   So yeah great place over all and the service was great here as well ,5,2015-11-08
I was enjoying my time there with my Pomeranian Yorkie and a few friends  I walked to the other side of the bar to check if a table was open and one owner of a dog told me to stay far away because her dog  likes snacks   We stayed on the other side of the grass until her dog lunged out from under the chairs  knocking them over and pulling the leash loose  to grab my dog by the neck and stand on it s hind legs  The owners didn t do anything except yell at it  I had to hit the dogs face to let mine go  The owners never said anything  never apologized  The one owner who told me that her dog  likes snacks  ended up going behind the bar and working  Before I found out she s a bartender there  they were all sitting in the corner staring at laughing at me while my hands were shaking and tears forming from a dog almost snapping the neck of mine  I will never go back to this place  which is a shame  The employee was awful and inconsiderate  Very cliche oriented and doesn t actually care about their customers ,1,2017-02-23
If I were only rating for the beer and atmosphere  this would be a   star review no questions asked and usually that s what we ll get   a pitcher of beer and hang out on the patio  The food however  is a little over priced for the quality  It s not bad at all  actually most of the food is pretty good   The food is priced too high though and it used to be better  We re guessing a change in food supplier because it used to be really good  We still love it and spend a lot of time on the patio  Great place for families too which is rare in a great bar ,4,2018-12-18
I really enjoy the food and beer selection at OHSO  but I have never heard of a restaurant that cuts to an answering machine when you call on a Sunday at       I guess you are just expected to risk there being a two hour wait whenever you go   at least at the Tatum location ,3,2015-05-18
Place is definitely cool  First time we checked it out the host was very green and seemed unsure of what was going on  Couldn t tell who was supposed  to be taken to their tables in what order etc  Servers were friendly  They have a pretty sweet beer selection  I ended up getting the AZ burger both times just because there isn t a large amount of variety on the menu but that burger is bomb  The bun is so soft and delicious  best burger bun I ve had in town for sure ,3,2015-06-16
This spot is great   much more of a family vibe compared to their Indian school location but the atmosphere is on point  Our server was a bit rough around the edges  not super friendly or provided much insight to the menu favorites  but you can t really expect much for a brewery    Food was delicious   beer selection ample and the crowd was entertaining  If you come here on a weekend around dinner time EXPECT children  Lots of them   especially outside ,4,2015-11-26
Amazing atmosphere  There is so much to do  corn hole  ping pong  etc  Not to mention the food and cocktails are to die for  Try the chicken and waffles  You won t be disappointed ,5,2017-05-02
Went to have a group meet up for dinner  The place is crowded  kids and dogs friendly  Ordered Ahi   Calamari  spicy seared wild caught ahi  sweet chili sauce  spring salad  peanut   wasabi dressing   Steak   Fries  skirt steak over garlic fries  cotija  micro greens  poblano aioli  and Cobb Salad  spring mix  bacon  baby tomato  avocado  corn  bleu cheese crumbles  cucumber  egg  citrus vinaigrette   The only food I liked was the Steak   Fries  The Calamari was soggy because they pour sauce right on top of it  the ahi was bland  The salad dressing was okay  Service was pretty quick and attentive ,3,2018-09-23
We went to OHSO as a large group Bachelor Party to watch the Super Bowl  however  as it turns out  the location we had reservations for was at different location      BUT Instead of letting my mistake ruin our group s night OHSO agreed to set us up here with no advance notice   The manager  Will  was super flexible and helpful  He set our night right   To add to it  our bartenders in the back Anthony and Hayley were a blast and so helpful   They gave us a memory for our entire trip we won t forget   Huge shoutout to everyone at OHSO   Give them all a raise and if you go here  leave a big tip   Great people   ,5,2019-02-09
Friendly staff   Ordered the brisket sandwhich and extra onion strings instead of fries  The onion strings were cooked earlier and tasted room temperature       I didn t eat them   The brisket appeared to be either a beef and sauce pre made item or they make a big batch and then hold it until it is served   The onion strings take a second so I don t know why they don t come out fresh and hot   Same with the brisket  Beef can be held and heated up with either steam or adding the sauce when heating  It tasted like it had been sitting all day s  and waiting for ME  Rather than me waiting for it fresh ,2,2018-09-17
Went here for Sunday brunch with some friends  Firstly  I enjoy coming to this location as it has a fun ambiance and the service is usually pretty good  The food is average  but it is always fun to get the mimosa included with the brunch options  My main issue was with how hot it was out on the patio which made it very hard to get comfortable  For outdoor summer seating  they did not have any misters on in our area and or no fans  A friend of mine had to move the patio umbrella closer to us since we were getting direct sunlight  I would definitely ask for indoor seating when it is hot outside ,3,2019-09-25
Great outdoor games for the kids  however way too many dogs   I love dogs  just not dog hair  which is everywhere bc there is not a rule about dogs staying on the ground  so when you sit in the middle aisle outside  you are destined to leave covered   My    year old son loved it as he made many friends with the animals   their owners over ping pong  the corn hole   maze game ,4,2017-01-10
I loved it here  Great outdoor patio with heat lamps  Fun games and great music  The best part is how dog friendly they are  They even have a little grass hangout area for the canines  We had a nice little  happy hour  Will def be going back ,5,2015-12-02
Such a great place  Nice outdoor seating that is pet and kid friendly  My kids really enjoy all of the games  and as adults  we enjoy the diversion that they afford for enough time to partake in some of their tasty appetizers  and a freshly brewed  ice cold beer  or whatever suits your fancy   We have had most of what is on the menu  and haven t found anything that we didn t like  The worst part  Everyone knows about this place now  and the parking lot can be a trial to find a spot  Don t let that deter you  though  You will be happy you went ,5,2018-08-13
We LOVE OHSO  especially this location and I would normally give this place   stars but the expectation fell short this past Sunday       We had a large group and unfortunately they were not able to accommodate our party  No biggie   we figured we would just show up a little early and put our names in  The girl at the front not only was not accommodating to our request  even offering to be seated separately she had a major attitude when we asked where we could sit and what our options were  Our server  the food and the atmosphere were otherwise on par  The only reason I am writing this review is because I do like coming here but having someone with a bad attitude and being one of the first faces you see when you walk in shouldn t represent the restaurant ,3,2017-05-11
How can anyone not like OHSO PV  It s a perfect destination if you want to have an outing with your pooch  We had three dogs in tow for our recent visit  our own and two foster pups  They happily hung out under our table on the patio  enjoying the homemade OHSO dog treats and all the attention they received from guests and the OHSO staff  Water was provided without asking  Nice   Being dog friendly is wonderful  but it only goes so far  Fortunately  OHSO has a great menu as well  I selected a strawberry salad this time around  Fresh and delicious  My daughter went for the brisket mac and cheese  her favorite menu item  The spouse prefers the AZ burger  Something for everyone  You can be as healthy or unhealthy as you like    We didn t have young children with us this time out  but OHSO does have a       kids menu with items like mac and cheese  cheeseburgers  grilled cheese    Seems like a lot of cheese  but the meals include a drink and you can opt for fruit instead of fries on the side  I think they also offer a pretzel dog and chicken nuggets for the kids   We prefer the patio  perfect for a chill time with kids and dogs  with activities like corn hole  Somehow OHSO manages to keep the patio comfortable even in the heat of summer  The interior dining room bar has a less chaotic  dog free  and more sophisticated vibe if that s your preference  It s perfect for enjoying OHSO s extensive brew menu  I m not a big beer drinker myself  but I ve been told more than once that the selections are great  so I m passing those observations along    We also enjoy the OHSO brunch  served Saturdays and Sundays            Lots of menu selections for adults and kids and  as always  water and treats provided for the pups  Don t forget to grab a couple of extra dog treats from the counter on your way out  The staff won t mind ,5,2016-03-30
OHSO  I have been to the OHSO on Hayden Rd and the one on Indian School Road and this one is a little different with a patio to bring your pets and play some bean bag toss   We ordered the Carna Asada Soft Tacos and the Salmon Burger which I would say the Salmon Burger was much better   The Carna Asada was lime pulled pork and tough squares of beef  It came with some guacamole and Salsa and   flour tortillas  The salsa and guacamole were pretty good but the meat did not have much taste   As for the salmon burger  it was pretty tasty and had a good crispness to the outer portion  it came with French fries    After trying a few different items at different locations  I would stick to the burgers which are probably their best item   We had a trainee waitress which she did well   Will come back again ,3,2016-11-30
Great place to eat if you have a dog  Love the food and service  I had the steak and fries and it was so delicious I m still craving them  Great variety of drinks and the service is pretty quick and very friendly ,5,2018-05-26
This is a really cool place  Dog friendly  great food  and even better beer    Need I say more ,5,2016-04-30
Love this location for OHSO  It has the perfect ambiance for a fun lively crowd  I ve brought my pup here a couple times and she absolutely enjoys coming here  Plus they offer dog treats at the entrance so she definitely enjoys coming here  I enjoy coming for the brunch  since they offer the     mimosa with your meal  which is totally amazing  They are not too flexible with making some changes to your dish during brunch which is a con  Friendly staff with lots of fun games  so it always make for a fun time ,4,2017-12-12
We love O H S O  Great place for the whole family  It s nice to be able to let the kids run around and play games  supervised of course   We had the pretzel board  and the gobbler turkey burger for lunch on our first visit  Their sweet potato fries are perfectly salty and crunchy and addictive  We have also been for brunch also which is a smoking deal  The idea of fruity pebbles French toast is better than the real thing but other than that excellent food   drink ,5,2016-06-16
Well As a guru in beers burgers and yelp I have to say AMAZING   literally the first experience here was Amazing       Nice staff    They treat Michi well   my dog   my bartender Kristina is absolutely fantastic     My stylist and I frequent bars in the valley and now THIS LOCATION is our number one STOP   Get the egg appetizer oh man and the brunch is to dye for    thank YOU thank YOU i will be a forever FAN    I can t even say how happy I am to find this location it s so much more  chill   than up  north   THANK U and my DOG  Michi says woof  woof my HUMBLY  TK,5,2017-07-11
Love how dog friendly this location is  There is a little grassy area where your pups can use the bathroom and interact with other dogs  as well as chairs for you to sit at while you are waiting for a table   Very family friendly also  which depending on who is reading this is a positive or negative  It is a bar so sometimes a little weird to see kids running around  especially since there are dogs throughout the place  But  it is nice to see a place that allows parents to hang with their friends and have their kids feel safe as well  This is mainly on the weekends  as I have been there for happy hour and dinner during the week and it is less crowded with families    Table service is hit or miss unfortunately  but I always have great bar service when I stop in  Sometimes the tables are wonderful and we have no complaints  are served right away and never have to ask for a refill on anything  Other times it seems we don t exist and   to   servers  including ours  will walk past our table that has empty water cups  empty beers  and no check on the table  This is the reason for the minus   star  The food is delicious and I always leave with my stomach full  I love the BBQ Burger  and their pretzels and cheese for happy hour are awesome  We come back because there are always those good times  and our dogs love the place  The treats they provide are a hit with them too ,4,2015-07-31
Love this place   The outdoor atmosphere is awesome and they have a lot of accommodations for dogs  We always enjoy the food and beer    One thing that turns us off is the amount of kids running around    Literally RUNNING or riding their scooters    One kid fell off her scooter and almost smacked her head on the corner of the bench I was sitting on    The adults can never play the ping pong or corn hole because it s overrun with kiddos    I was hit by a football like three times I was there last time     I think it s great that it s a family environment but would love it if they had an adults only time of day ,4,2018-04-08
This location was incredibly considerate  There was an accidental mistake made with my dinner and the waiter was remarkably nice and apologetic about it  He proceeded to have the kitchen create an entire new entree and later provided a pitcher of their superb beer to compensate for the mishap   Their food and drink are always delicious but the sincerity and thoughtfulness expressed by the staff have really encouraged me to recommend this place and  of course  make a return visit  Thank you OHSO ,4,2016-08-12
Went there for a family going away get together and the worst service so tipped      As we were all outside to say our goodbyes for the summer our waitress Jessica came out an was upset with the tip so made a brief scene with attitude  Poor experience and ambience  Huge loud place with booming business  but nothing special  Less than stellar  but apparently feeling entitled  and caring more for their own comfort then their guests  service staff ,1,2015-05-02
Cool place to hangout especially if you bring kids or the dog  The outdoor seating area has lots for them to keep them busy  Beers are tasty as well as the food ,4,2017-04-23
Trendy outdoor brew and wine pub where dogs are welcome  Food is good  not great but definitely worth multiple visits  The pork  wings  are excellent  Games for kids  Very nice place ,4,2018-01-13
Love everything about this place  The food the beer the service  They are the best  Dog friendly even ,5,2017-11-07
Love the outdoor patio here  it s definitely set up to be enjoyed all year round  even in AZ  It s definitely the largest of them all and they have some  grass  area with lawn games  similar to The Yard  Can t go wrong with their     or     mimosa beer brunch  Love that it s pup friendly too ,5,2016-06-28
Came here with my   and   year old for dinner  Food was really good and something different that your traditional chain  I had the AZ burger which was really good ,5,2018-01-29
Just had the absolute worst experience here  Went in and ordered   drinks a mimosa and a Bloody Mary at the back bar outdoors  First  the bartender was completely non responsive to us for about    minutes  perhaps not hip enough   then he finally waited on us  Ordered a     mimosa and     Bloody Mary  While my husband was signing the tab  and yes we did leave a good tip  my husband basically touched the top heavy Bloody Mary  The drink went over  Any good bartender  and yes I have children in the industry  would have given another drink at no charge  as yes there was customer contact  but the drink was way too heavy   This guy looked totally annoyed at the accidental spill and said if you want another you pay for it  it wasn t my fault  I have been totally at fault for an accidental drink spill and received a replacement  Sorry to have an accidental spill and ruin your day  normal part of your profession and I d say this bartender better learn to handle it better ,1,2018-03-09
Omg seriously wonderful   We sat inside the first time we came  and we thought it was alright   The next time we came with our dog and sat outside  We loved it  OHSO caters to dogs and their owners so much  and it was such a good experience  We were given free dog biscuits for our little babe and even a water bowl  There were  oh so  many dogs  All the owners were really friendly  and everyone just enjoyed being in such a great relaxing place with their canine friends   The beer was also very good  We ended up staying for a couple hours longer than we planned due to the relaxing and fun atmosphere  and the good beers   Our waitresses offered some beer samples for us when we weren t sure what to order  and it worked  as we ended up ordering   pitchers of the sample  She was great   We will be back with our dog again and again ,5,2017-08-20
Oh So good   This place reminds me a lot of The Yard since it was the first place I know that had the backyard games concept down   Not a bad idea to share needless to say about the idea   I rather enjoy coming to this particular OHSO because of it and I love the dogs   I don t own one myself  but I come here to enjoy everyone else   I would say OHSO is probably the best dog bar in town and plus they have   locations   Maybe more to come     With seasonal craft brews always on tap and especially highlighting local breweries  what s not to love about this place   For the several times I m been here the staff has been really helpful and on top of things   Drinks a flowing and foods a cooking  whether it s Brunch  Lunch  or Dinner time OHSO gots you covered   Brunch specials are my favorite  so far I had the OHSO Classic and Steak   Egg Burrito for brunch   I didn t care much for the burrito since it wasn t anything too special   The Classic well is classic breakfast with potatoes  scrambled eggs  bacon  and toast   Then again guess I m not here for the food either   wink   I had the Burger Cheese for dinner once and that was a pretty solid burger   I would say the soft bun and cheesy burger really made this burger perfect with a cold beer   Overall  a OHSO deserves my love and I will continue to be a patron simply because the craft brew is awesome and the atmosphere is always so lively    Enjoy ,4,2015-04-14
I have been to the one in central phoenix and enjoyed it  but I think this location is better  It has a large patio with misters and several ping ping tables  The beer and food is also amazing ,5,2017-07-09
For    minutes an alarm was going off   Supposedly caused by the breweries co  line   My ears couldn t take any more and they offered absolutely nothing to their guests for the discomfort   I just wanted to pay my bill and get out of there to get away from the obnoxious loud noise    Food took too long to come out and our waitress only had three tables   but consistently only serviced one table  Food is good   beers are good   but the service and loud alarm for so long makes this place unbearable   Food wait was    minutes   which seemed really long for the items ordered ,1,2017-02-20
I love this new location  The patio is amazing  lots of games and tables  The happy hour menu is perfect for drinks after work ,5,2015-04-20
So disappointed in this place  Waitress greeted us and asked for drink order  I had a beer my son a water  Asked her to give us some time for food order  Waited    min  for her to come back around  Ordered an app and   meals and a side  Never saw her again  Runner brought food   no one checked back except the guy pouring waters  Let me just say we had the artichoke kale app and it was like soup  Worst artichoke dip I ve ever had  My soup was not great   sweet potato fries were cold and my sons tacos not great  The only guy that came by like   times was the bus guy with his large plastic food container asking what dishes we were done with  Pretty tacky  FINALLY waitress came by   never asking us if everything was ok I just asked for check  I will not ever be back  Not sure if because I didn t order a flight of beer or what but so disappointed I will never come back again ,1,2018-11-30
I LOVE OHSO  I have been here a few times with my brother and his friend and absolutely love it  I can bring my dog which is obviously top priority duh  The food is great but most of all the apple pie dessert is superb  I love every bite of this restaurants food and I highly recommend ,5,2019-01-04
This place is new and has a great hipster vibe  There are tons of dogs running around since it s a dog friendly restaurant outside however it can be too loud some times    The FOOD As an appetizer we ordered the steak and fries and they were by far a great start indeed the meat was juicy tender and fill of delicious flavors  The fries were crispy and salted to perfection  Both combined made a meal for the gods  As you can see the main plate had a lot to live up to after this spectacular starter  We both ordered their famous AZ BURGER which sounded promising  When the burger arrived all I wanted to do was stick it in my mouth  When I did there was a part of me that was let down  I took another bite hoping it be better than the first but the flavor was not there  The cream cheese was overpowering and watered down all other flavors    The beer I tasted was the orange something and it was refreshing a bit like a blue moon but lighter  I would have the beer and the fries all over again but maybe switch up the main dish  Over all great spot but did not live up to it s promising main dish  Will definitely go again to see if something else is better if that time comes I will update this review  Until then   stars are fair for the overall experience ,3,2015-03-31
Pretzel Board is always great  Love the burgers and outside patio  Krystina is THE BEST server EVER   ,5,2016-11-13
First time at this specific location with the wife and child    We started off with the pork wing appetizer and they were just decent   nothing really special however the bbq sauce that is served with them is pretty good   Nice  sweet sauce to dip them in   We had the Bacon and Cheese burger and it was your standard slightly overpriced burger with bacon and gouda   sorry just meh   We asked for onion straws as a side  its not part of the sides menu  and they were served ever so slightly hotter than lukewarm makimg me eat them faster than i wanted to   The service by     Chris was nowhere close to be happy about working   very unenthusiastic presentation   Hey listen  I understand that this place is more about the beer and even that was not served in a cold glass which mademe feel that I was in a country that serves its beer room temp   Uninspired food and service however the ambience is fantastic   great looking place ,3,2017-05-27
I have had several great experiences here  but this last trip was very disappointing  To start with we ordered a couple of pitchers of beer  which by the way is a great beer  however they were barely cold I mean probably    degrees or so  To top this off we got glasses that were obviously not too long out of the dish washer because they were actually warm to the touch  combine these two and we got room temperature beer  yuck    We mentioned to the waitress that the beers were not that cold  she says   that s the way they are   we subsequently asked if we could get chilled glasses  waitress response     sorry we don t have chilled glasses cuz we would go through too much glassware if we did     What   I don t even get this response  nothing done for us  we wanted a beer so we drank a mediocre beer that was way too warm    Next came our order which was the pork wings  I have had them before and they are delicious for sure  however tonight they come out charred all the way through  couldn t tell the meat from the bone  I asked the waitress to have these remade since they were way overcooked  she apologized and returned them to the kitchen    minutes later she returns and says     I talked to the head chef about the pork wings  and we were wondering if you would like something else  cuz you know these are a dry rub     What again   I still don t understand this response  I politely said no  I ve had these a couple of times before I know what a dry rub is  they were overcooked and would like another order cooked properly  They finally brought out an order that was cooked correctly  they were great   One more irritating mention  every time an item showed up to the table it was a different server and they would auction the food off  Who s having the        Come on  A place of this caliber should have table and seat numbers memorized  seems rookie    End of night we wound up with good wings  the second time   warm beers  and wondering if we will go back  I really wanted to love this place  it has great potential  Management if you are listening    you need to tighten up the controls a bit  and then bribe me to come back in and give you another chance ,1,2017-03-10
The food is great  been here for happy hour and brunch  Prices are good  too  The customer service needs to improve  seriously  No one seems confident in what they are doing and processes need to be established ,4,2015-04-26
I am sold  I am closer to the Arcadia location  but THIS location is AWESOME  The wife  the toddler  and I dined here on a impromptu weeknight  We choose to sit outside  which really does not feel like you are actually outside  I really love the u shape high top booths  because my toddler can walk about while being contained  Now let s talk food  We enjoyed the Pretzel Board as an appetizer  the AZ Burger  and the Portobello Sandwich  Everything was prepared perfectly and was very delicious  I was really surprised by the Portobello Sandwich  it was fabulous I wanted more  but it was not mine to devour  The onion straws on the AZ burger are something to battle over  I could have eaten a whole plate of them  We ordered the Mac  n cheese on the kids menu for the little one and it was the only thing that was disappointing  It s pretty much Kraft mac n cheese and could be upgraded a lil bit  The service was great too and never even noticed them  but all my beverages were never empty  I can t wait to come back and enjoy the outdoor patio and all the other bonus features ,4,2016-01-03
Chicken and waffles were very good  I never understood what all the hype was about until I had them at OSHO Brewery  They definitely go well with a beer too  The coffee vodka is also great  Get it neat or on ice and sip and enjoy a game on one of the many TV s  You can bring your dog too ,5,2018-11-26
Absolutely love this place  we always have dinner parties here  We love the beer  the burgers    the games  You can also bring your dog on the patio  The orange pedal beer is my favorite paired up nicely with the AZ burger  The place has a very laid back industrial look to it  I love the lanterns  The service is on point everyone is super knowledgeable  friendly   accommodating ,5,2019-01-14
I have been here a couple of times and I have always enjoyed myself  This last time I went was during brunch  when I usually go for dinner  Honestly  going their for brunch on a Saturday  was different becuase the staff was a little awkward  The server we had was never confident in her answers when asking her questions if we can substitute an item with another  When my friend asked her to substitute an item  she had to go ask her manager and the server never came back  During the same time  a different friend of mine was putting her left overs in the to go box to take home  and a completely different server said   I will wait until your done  so I don t have to make two     trips   Like seriously  There is no one here  your making yourself come across lazy and making us feel awkward  Different servers throughout this place were just eyeing on things that they can take away from your table  I think some of the brunch staff are lazy compared to the night servers   Other than that the food is a   Star  It has always been going  weather it s for brunch or dinner ,4,2019-02-03
tried all the beers and they were all so strong and to favorable    I absolutely love draft beet  but I couldn t drink any of theirs   why can t a microbrewery make a beer for those who don t want to drink something that taste like toxic waste or had    oranges in each glass   Fun atmosphere   good service    I think their prices are quite high    but I could live with high prices if I could get an awesome tasting beer with my food    which is the main reason why I went there   Tried to find a beer similar to blue moon but everything I was so so harsh and strong        I wish brewmasters would understand not everybody wants a stout beer or a strong IPA ,3,2019-01-03
Great beer selection  we tried twelve varieties    flights of four   Not a bad one in the lot  depending on your preference  They ranged from the light and fruity  not my style  personally  to the thick and hearty  more my speed   Of you like the heavier style  I went with the last four on their menu and enjoyed them all   The food was really good  I highly recommend the buffalo chicken dip for an appetizer and the chicken and waffles  The brocket mac and cheese was tasty as well  Service was great   Parking is a little limited  They have a great outside area but it gets full during busy times and you may have to wait for that sweet spot ,5,2019-06-21
I still love this place but I m updating my comments due to the crazy dynamic some parents are creating for everyone else   I love kids  I have four   I love meeting my friends and their kids here      What I don t love is watching parents completely ignoring their kids and letting them run and scream shriek constantly across the business for over an hour   Last night   couples let their   or   children create complete havoc in the back area  they put what appeared to be a    to    year old girl in charge of several younger kids   The staff and several patrons suggested to the group that what they were doing was disruptive and at times dangerous  the boy s climbed up into a portion of the fence border area and disappeared for a bit   one little girl came up behind some patrons and just grabbed the leash of a dog and tried to pull it away      they moved dozens of rocks to the fountain  when they weren t throwing them   It got so bad that a half dozen patrons just decided to leave the bar area and go somewhere else    It was to the point that a bouncer would have been called in if these had been adults   When all of this was brought to the attention of so called parents they didn t even bother to get out of their seats   Don t ruin this awesome place for the rest of us ,5,2016-10-26
Yet again  another fabulous time we had at OHSO  The Popcycle Blonde is my absolute fav beer ever and the AZ Burger was scrumptious  Not to mention it was a perfectly cooked med well  Thanks again OHSO for an outstanding time  Cheers ,5,2018-12-16
I ve finally completed my trifecta of reviews for OHSO  PV being the newest location  but same old OHSO fun  If you have read my reviews I was actually hard on OHSO at first but after giving it another chance I ve grown to appreciate how good these locations can be    First off I love craft beer and OHSO has plenty if it  They also brew at their Arcadia location and look to be brewing here soon  They always have a great lineup of rotating beer taps    Second the food is actually really good  I ve eaten at All of the locations and I love their steak and fries and come on Sunday s for their BBQ  I saw they were offering a  luau for April but sadly didn t get a chance to come    In my opinion this location is the most dog friendly  They have a large patio here and even have a green area for dogs to run and have a giant water fountain for dog bowls  I have Shih Tzus and plan on bringing them here soon    I also think that the PV location is larger than the other two  This location has plenty of sitting especially on the patio    Can t really write much more without repeating myself on my reviews on the other two locations  But I really did like this PV location  Hopefully they open a west side location soon   Oh checkout their late night happy hour  Pitchers of AZ beer for     Can t beat it ,5,2015-05-12
I can t believe I haven t written a review here yet  We ve been coming here since they opened  Good food  great beer  awesome brunch and a fun place to hang out  Whether you re alone or with    people  you will be well taken care of by the stellar service    We love almost everyone that has waited on us ,5,2016-10-07
My fianc  and I went on a Saturday night at     and they said it would be a    minute wait so we decided to wait since    minutes is not that bad     minutes go by and we check in they say    more minutes     minutes go by decided to check in once more and they said another    minutes  We decided to wait since we already waited so long  Those    minutes go by and and the host says another    minutes  We decided to leave since that is absolutely ridiculous  Learn to quote properly it is not that hard    If the host quoted the right amount of time from the start we would have never waited that long since that is absolutely ridiculous  And another thing is don t allow people to sit at a table for two hours when there is a two hour long wait  learn how to run a restaurant people ,1,2015-04-12
Very good food and fun atmosphere  The brisket Mac and cheese is my go to every time  I love Mac and cheese and get it at every restaurant that has it on the menu  This one is by far one of the best  Their patio is also very fun even when it s hot outside it is still nice ,5,2017-03-10
This home grown vodka is great    vodka   The happy hour menu is adequate to good  The bartender let me order the kids chicken strips and so I was happy   The vibe here is great and if I wrote a review every time I stopped people might wonder about the amount of vodka that I consume  LOL  I like to work from my laptop at the bar or at a quiet table outside during the day ,5,2017-09-08
This place is the JAM   If only San Diego had the same amount of land as PV  This place is huge   Indoor seating  outdoor seating  and a patio full of games  live music  sports on tv and more  A beer lovers paradise  Literally after dragging my parter around town all weekend with my bestie  this place was his sunday night reward  You should have seen his eyes light up and the grin on his face   It s been a while since I was here and now I m posting this review  but I can t say my food was bad or just plain good    whatever I ordered was great    Note  this place is probably a very good date spot ,5,2017-02-05
Came here on Easter Sunday  Atmosphere was great  love how it s pet friendly  even saw a pot belly pig   and the staff was fantastic  Only complaint would be that my chicken seemed over cooked and dry  I m sure if I said something they would have gladly taken care of it  but it was still edible  My girlfriend ordered a burger and that was to die for   I ll try it again  but will probably stick to their beef and pork and pass on the chicken ,4,2018-04-08
Finally tried the OHSO Monte Cristo and I wasn t disappointed   It was delicious  the Black Forest ham with the Swiss cheese was very good  What put it over the top was the raspberry compote  the flavor with the ham and Swiss combined with the French toast bread was just perfect  I think I may have found a new favorite  ,4,2017-07-30
I ve been here once for happy hour and the service was horrible  I was there for an hour and a half and did not get food or a drink  Yes I could have gone up to the bar and stood there and begged for attention for    minutes like my friends did  but I m used to places like old town dos gringos that has a similar layout and atmosphere  yet makes sure you have food and drinks every    minutes  I m sure Ohso is making enough money as is  but they could be making a lot more by if they wanted to ,1,2017-04-06
Huge location and great service  I wish they had the breakfast flatbread like at Arcadia but everything else is great,4,2015-11-26
Loved it    The outdoor seating is awesome and the gaming area was so fun   Kept our   teenage boys busy while we waited for food   Food was really good too   Loved the design aspects with tap handles and lots of steel structures   Super cool   Great job OHSO   ,5,2016-03-24
The entire experience was amazing  Our waiter Sam G had a ton of personality and was very accommodating  It was our first visit and he guided us through the menu and gave us a few suggestions  although I don t think we could have made a bad choice on the menu  We split the fruity pebble French toast and the chicken and waffles  Both were phenomenal and to add to the value  all of the meals come with a mimosa or a local beer  We will definitely return to try some of the OHSO beers and the Hawaiian BBQ  I definitely recommend making a visit  ,5,2018-07-22
Waited    minutes to be sat when numerous empty tables were available  but not cleaned    Once seated we waited another    minutes for service  Service received was abrupt and abrasive  nothing felt welcoming  Beer menu was a   out of    Atmosphere  had there been good service  could have been   out of    Can t recommend ,2,2016-03-21
Great food  great service  great mimosas  Thanks for a well worth it Sunday brunch  We ll be back for sure ,4,2017-05-11
Yum  Also another great spot by our house  We pretty much love everything  Including the beer   We frequent this place because it s dog friendly  and our pups LOVE the free homemade dog treats   All   of ya leave happy    I d recommend the French fries  guac  chicken and waffles and any beer on tap    The outside setting is amazing too  They ve got a really kick ass beer tap water fountain  only dispensing water unfortunately   game for kids  an outdoor bar  and a really comfy seating area ,5,2018-04-17
Good food  decent beer  I give it   out of   stars  The one on Indian school is better but this one was god too ,4,2015-11-10
One of my neighbors was telling me about this restaurant and I kid you not it was worth every bit of    minute drive  The environment was really good  the food was very reasonably priced  the drinks were good and it was pet friendly which was a very unique and fun way for me to experience a restaurant because I have a dog and my dog would love this restaurant  They even have food for dogs  If you re in Arizona or passing through Arizona this particular location is a spot where you definitely want to visit and have breakfast  brunch  lunch or dinner you will not be disappointed  The Mamosa s had just enough champagne and orange juice and the chicken and waffles were on point  The syrup tasted like real maple syrup not that maple syrup that you buy at the grocery store that s full of added preservatives or whatever the word is called the Sarah tasted very very original it was different from any syrup that I tasted in the waffles were toasted just right to where they weren t overcooked and they were undercooked  The chicken was seasoned to the point where I could ve just ate the chicken and waffles by itself but I ve got a sweet tooth so you know I had to dip it in the syrup  Long story short if you re reading this and you re not on your way to this restaurant get up and go NOW    ,5,2018-10-20
Great vibe   I m not a beer drinker but I went here with friends  The atmosphere is SUPER fun  The good vibes are infectious   We ordered the pretzel board  crab wontons  salmon  and a brisket sandwich  The food was delicious  The wait staff was incredibly attentive  Overall great place  ,5,2016-10-01
OHSO wonderful   My dog loves this place and I do too   Sunday Brunch is the place to be and what an amazing beer selection   I love their dollar samples   Let s me have a variety of beers and their small enough that I can keep them coming without it getting warm from the summer heat ,5,2017-09-07
Honestly just came for drinks    Sat outside  turned on the heaters  drank n played lil ping pong sipn on drafts    Our boy kept the glasses full  so zero complaints ,5,2017-01-28
Fantastic  My son had the chicken tenders  loved them  I split the Burger   Cheese with my wife with a side of the jalape o polenta  Everything was perfect and delicious ,5,2018-09-03
Great gluten free menu  Friendly staff but you need to bring back the pork wings  They were the BEST  Or some other gluten free wings  PLEASE   BRINGBACKTHEWINGS,5,2018-11-11
I m not sure who would not give this place   stars   The outdoor seating is great and with all the games  ping pong  corn hole  etc   and the water features  it makes it a great place for brunch after youth football or baseball  our   year old boy loves it  is always occupied and always makes new friends   The food   yup      of it is top notch   The cheeseboard is great   Sometimes I feel they pre make some of the brunch food  but the majority of the time it s fresh and tasty   And  it always comes out really fast   The brunch deals get you a glass of champagne or a beer with your meal   It s a good excuse for a Saturday morning beer and then ultimately a lazy day   I guess I don t need to drink it  but instead we just don t come here every weekend   Weekend nights     PM  are way too busy   We ve tried a few times  but just don t have it in us to wait    minutes to sit and eat  especially when the boy is with us   We typically will head north to Haymaker s       min wait  or Blue     usually no wait   but no one local can compare to this atmosphere   Another great addition to the local community   We re glad you re in our backyard and look forward to more lazy Saturday s   Chris Birchby,5,2016-02-29
Great outdoor dog friendly restaurant  Can get busy  but it s worth the wait  Service is generally good  Food is good  try the Diablo burger   Games and and great place to relax ,4,2016-04-22
This place has the best burgers I ve ever had  the diablo burger is my favorite  They also have a cool vibe  You can bring your dogs to the outdoor area and they have ping pong tables and cornhole set up outside along with some other games  They also have several big A Cs outside so even in the Phoenix summer it isn t too hot ,5,2016-04-24
I LOVE THIS PLACE     I would first like to say that anyone that has had less than a stellar experience should definitely try it out again  Everything about O H S O  the atmosphere  the food  and the DOGS make it reign supreme in my book    Sitting outside on their beautiful patio  I was greeted promptly by a warm smile and a cold glass of water with a cucumber slice for myself and my dog   My server was very informative about the menu and pointed me in the right direction for both food and drink    I wanted something somewhat light but still hardy  I went with their new  Hot Chick  sandwich with a side of grilled asparagus  For my drink  I ordered their classic Mule  The drink arrived very fast and when I took the first sip  I was B L O W N away  Their mules pack a tangy punch with their fresh ginger and homemade vodka  It was so refreshing and could be potentially dangerous      The food arrived in a giant skillet which gave it a unique and whimsical look to it  When I took my first bite of my Hot Chick  I died and went to fried chicken sandwich HEAVEN  The bun was sweet and light but held the sandwich perfectly together   I hate when I take a bite and everything falls out of the bottom  The fried chicken was cooked to perfection and the buffalo sauce that was dressed on it was the ultimate ratio to sauce and meat  The blue cheese dressing was tangy but not toooo overpowering  So even if you don t like blue cheese  their sauce will change your mind  The apple slaw added a light crunch that the heavy sandwich needed  The asparagus was also grilled perfectly and seasoned just right  As you can tell   I had a great lunch at O H S O    This place made me so happy and who knew a restaurant could make you feel that way           in my book for food drink  SERVICE  including the bartenders cause their drinks rock   the hosts  the atmosphere  and everything else      PS  If you didn t read the whole review  I ll get straight to the point   GO TO OHSO  ,5,2016-06-23
Great atmosphere  love eating on the patio outdoors  Loved the beer and even took a growler home it was so tasty  I ll be back again and again ,5,2016-04-29
This place is great for group family outings  We sat outside on the patio with a large group  the misters and fans really helped with keeping it comfortable on an August evening  There were a ton of kids there on a Saturday night and a ton of dogs   Love the vibe and decor   Soooo  this is where you lose me a bit because  well    a dog sitting on the patio chairs  with their paws and bodies on the tables where people eat  um  EWWW  Look  I love animals  but I need some boundaries  I don t want dog slobber or hair in my food or on my clothes   I didn t see one dog in the designated dog area  but I saw a ton of dogs on and around tables and chairs  It was just  gross  I love dogs   really I do   Anyway my food was ok  I m not a fan of sweet bread  and the bun on my turkey burger was sweet  maybe a potato bun   Fries were over salted  I ended up taking the bun off and trying wrap my burger with the ton of greens that were on the burger  no easy task    Our server  Tasha  was awesome   Kept our drinks coming and our waters filled and was super friendly ,4,2015-08-12
One of my favorite happy hour spots  The food is great  I highly recommend the Mac and Cheese  Great selection of beers and cocktails  You can always see a lot of dogs as well which is a plus   ,4,2017-03-02
I really love this place and think their food and beer options are delicious  I hate to write a poor review  however I am fairly certain that my credit card information was compromised after visiting the restaurant  The next week  I had numerous online charges pop up that I had not made  Thankfully my bank was able to refund the money  A few nights ago  I also found out that a friend also believes that her credit card information was compromised at the same location  Of course it is impossible to trace  but I would like to warn customers to be careful using cards at this location ,2,2017-01-24
Great place to have food and bring your dog  Me and my other dog mom friends come here often  Good beers and light summery cocktails,4,2018-09-01
Love this place  They have great brunch with fruity pebbles and mimosas  Happy hour is great but most of all Krystina gave us the best service tonight  Water was always filled and when we asked for two flights and to surprise us she was up for the challenge ,5,2016-10-29
I love the idea of this place  Pet friendly  kids are welcome and the atmosphere of the outside patio is exactly what I need on the weekends  Very laid back and fun to have brunch with friends and family  I am definitely a fan  I enjoyed the food at this location  however  the service could definitely improve  The server we had was not attentive at all  she came by maybe three times so we had to ask other servers and bussers for drinks  a box  and the check  She did not look like she was happy to be there  making money  serving the costumers  It was like painful for her to smile for once    I ll be back  hoping for a better service next time ,4,2017-09-05
What a great concept   Here is a restaurant that promotes social interactions with a lay back atmosphere  large outdoor and indoor dining options   Families  friends  furry friends are all welcome   In fact  adults get to chat on comfortable couches while kids play ping pong   It s brewery time all day there  come thirsty and have a good time Their menus have a good selection  check it out for yourself   my pix    I had a Cobb salad  Ron had  a turkey Club with fries  Both were good but pricey for what they were  My Cobb was a load of greens and not much else  bacon chips  didn t appeal to me    Ron s Club was average good   Overall it is a sweet spot in town ,4,2018-03-27
Came in for a bite on a cool Tuesday evening  Been here many times and the environment is always a great time  Since it was Tuesday and cool the patio was pretty quiet   Grabbed a table inside and the three of us had dinner  I enjoyed the Gobbler Turkey Burger which was fantastic with a side of sweet potato fries  The bun that the burger was served on was delicious    I had an Orange Pedal beer which was very good as usual ,5,2018-02-21
Happy Hour not so happy  Terrible service    different servers in       hours  and each new one did not have a clue about our order  One of our party never did get her second drink   Very confusing  Happy Hour apps  guacamole looked fabulous  BUT  not one hint of green chilies and for some strange reason  there were raisins in it   We all agreed  yuck  Hummus tasteless  They never did bring the cheese dip   The wontons were good   Sad  It s the only place like it in PV and we wanted it to be good ,2,2015-08-14
If your on a weight gain diet or trying to bulk up don t order the     blackened salmon filet     Seriously small amount of food   It doesn t come with free refills either  believe me I tried ,2,2015-09-02
I love the atmosphere here   I frequently go out and more times then not I have my daughter    she absolutely loves this place and has a fantastic time   The menu seems to be getting tastier  love it ,5,2016-02-29
I came across this restaurant accidently one day when i was waiting to get my nails done  but i didnt go in until about   months later to celebrate my boyfriend and I s   year anniversary  We ubered there and i was already so excited because this place looked really cool and fun and iv been wanting to come here for a while  When we got there it was a full house on a sunday night which is always a good sign  There beer selection is incredible and our server Leah  was very helpful with any questions we had  as well as any samples we would like  My boyfriend  Quinn and i both got a pint of the vanilla swirl which they brew there and it was amazzzing   we then had a couple green tea shots  but let me just say there bloody marys are incredddibbble  Im a freak when it comes to bloody marys and when Leah suggested the jalepeno vodka i jumped right on it   omg it was the best bloody s  i ever had lol  For food we had the ahi and calamari  it was good but not    dollars good  The mac del mar with shrimp was so yummy  Ohso brewery is a really fun place with incredible brews and outstanding service  We definatley enjoyed our anniversary  and cant wait to come back ,5,2016-11-28
The best about this place is for sure the ambience  The outdoor patio is wonderful and inside has a cool vibe as well  The staff I have encountered have always been friendly    I like their beer and I m usually not one to order beer  They have a solid happy hour too  some good small plate deals and   dollar pitchers   The food is decent  Besides appetizers they have burgers  sandwiches  tacos and some entree plates  Pretty standard brewery food just jazzed up a little bit  They keep their menu the same and it s not as big as it could be but like I said  just hanging out here for some beers is what makes this place great ,4,2017-12-07
Love this place  Awesome food  beers and service  The AZ burger and Chicken and Waffles are mint,5,2019-05-01
After skipping breakfast  we were looking for a quick lunch before tackling Trader Joes  It was early and uncrowded so we were seated immediately and our waitress was quick with menus  I ordered a Berry Hard Cider and while I can t say there was a big berry taste  this drink was not really sweet so was a real thirst quencher for a hot day  My husband ordered a beer and an enormous turkey sandwich on a huge croissant  Fresh tasting and packed with ingredients  he could only finish half  I ordered the grilled cheese  oozing with melted fontina  bacon  tomatoes  and ham  this was perfect comfort food  until halfway through when it became uncomfortable  but I could barely finish half  Both our sandwiches came with fries  I tried to ignore them because I was immediately overwhelmed with my sandwich  but the few I had were crisp and delicious  Considering the few patrons in the restaurant  the service could have been quicker but my server was cheerful and accommodating  They have a patio that s dog friendly  I briefly considered sharing my uneaten sandwich with Wonderdog but  I had brought home a complimentary dog biscuit which my dog devoured  So  no guilt for leaving him at home  I liked this place and we will go back  maybe for Happy Hour tomorrow ,4,2019-05-31
This is my favorite OHSO   Not only does it have great atmosphere  but the staff here is awesome  I brought my dog and during dinner he chewed through his leash without us noticing  The hostesses were on it  They saw him off leash and grabbed him right away before he even got outside  They even gave us a free leash so that we could finish our meal ,5,2019-05-03
Had a wonderful time at dinner last night  The atmosphere is great  Nice friendly service  We brought our dog Poppi along and they made her feel right at home as we walked in  They gave her a water bowl and a doggie treat  Thanks for being AWESOME  Cant wait to come visit again ,5,2019-09-01
A friend told us to check this place out and we are glad we did  The bf and I went at    pm and got their late night menu  The bf got the BBQ Burger which was fanfreakingtastic and I got the Steak Fries  another amazing choice   I don t know what type of bun that was but it was fluffy and heavenly   I tried their Peach Smash drink and the bf got the Orange Pale  My drink was top notch  kind of liked the Orange Pale but not so much  acquired taste    This place completely reminded me of Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale  same vibe    Overall we a great vibe  great food and great drinks  We will definitely come back  I also want to try the North Scottsdale location ,5,2017-07-03
So  we had wondered to that part of town and needed a good place for lunch   I liked the other OHSO locations so we decided to give this one a try   Glad we did   This is the best of the   we have gone   Love the layout and the bar   Tons of seating inside and outside   Excellent service when we sat at the bar   Lots of parking space   One of the best Bloody Mary s in town   Love the spiced jerky they put in it   We brought friends from out of town and they loved it   He was amazed at the size of the chicken and waffles   My burger was really good   Just wish it was a little spicier   Good selection of beers on tap   I wish there was one closer to Peoria   I will definitely be back when I m in the area ,5,2017-06-19
I have been to OHSO s newest location a number of times  including today for lunch  It is good for lunch and happy hour  and for a drink and some apps  It also is good for families and kids  If you don t want to be around kids at night or during the weekend  you will need to sit inside or go somewhere else   The patio is great  During the summer they have a number of large air conditioning units blowing cold air  Today we sat inside and between the indoor and outdoor air  we were cool even though we were sitting by a door   The beer was great  which is a given   The food is good to  Today I have the Asian Chop Salad  but had them replace the chicken with ahi  It was seasoned well and had good flavor  It also was a bit spicy  which I like  And the dressing was enough without being too much   My group also had a veggie burger and a regular hamburger  Thumbs up all around   So if you are in the area you should stop in for a beer and some food ,4,2015-08-29
Great place  Sam was out waiter and was beyond the best we have ever experienced  He was on top of our needs and exceeded our expectations  We were overly please with the service we received  We will happily be back soon and asking for Sam as our waiter    ,5,2017-09-17
OH SO    THIS is what everyone is talking about  I happened to have been shopping at the recently relocated Penzey s Spices  near Albertsons at Tatum and Shea  when I overheard a customer talking  no   RAVING about OHSO  She said she comes  in to town   which means that she probably lives in Cave Creek or Mesa   just to go to Penzey s and OHSO  well    I thought    why not do the same  So  after completing my Penzey s purchase  I headed across the street to OHSO  And  I am OH SO  okay  enough of that    I promise  glad I did  It was a beautiful Saturday  around  pm and the place was bustling  Just that perfect combination of busy enough to tell you that others liked it  but not so busy that I felt rushed to move on to make room for the next customer  Clearly this is a place where friends meet to catch up and hang out  Perfect  right  Well  I started off my adventure by sitting at the bar and ordering an OHSO Handlebar Hefe  Very nice  Then I checked out the menu  They have a very good selection of apps  salads  burgers and  wiches  I was torn between the Hot Pastrami sandwich and the Diablo burger  The server recommended the burger as did the  much  younger patron to my right  Well then  burger it was  And it turned out to be a very solid choice  The burger was well prepared and came with shoestring fries which I prefer to steak fries as the latter always seem to be somewhat undercooked  My only complaint with my burger was that the bun was either not toasted or not toasted well  This was a problem as the toppings they put on it made it a bit soggy  But other than that  it was wonderful  Who says you can t teach an old dog a new trick  And speaking of dogs  you should know that OHSO sports a dog friendly patio which is so cool  The cute pooches make you feel like you are hanging out at a friend s backyard   So the next time I need to swing by Penzey s for some Fox Point or Hot Curry  I will be SURE to visit OHSO  I recommend you do the same  You will be OH SO glad you did  sorry  I couldn t resist      Knife   Written by Knife of Knife N Fork  Please check out the reviews by my critic in crime  Fork  of Fork N Knife  ,4,2017-03-11
This new location is fantastic  I m so surprised to read about lack of service  as we didn t experience this at all  We went for dinner on a Sunday with   people and   dogs  There was a long wait  but the texting feature they use to waitlist people is very convenient  ALSO  they offer seating in comfy lounge chairs while you wait  A waitress came over within minutes of us sitting at those  and took our drink order   which arrived promptly  We actually only waited about     the time they quoted us   and the atmosphere was so enjoyable  it didn t feel like waiting    The food was very good  as always at OHSO   The burgers are to die for  and the green chili dip was very good too  Their BBQ is great     We love that they are so dog friendly  This location is even more so   if that s possible  They brought our girls water  and paid attention to them as if they were also paying customers    Cannot think of one thing to complain about   We ll be back  ,5,2015-04-13
Best chicken and waffles I ve ever had  Finally a good meal at OHSO  Brunch was great  Mimosas are top notch too    Hopeful for a good dinner next time ,5,2018-08-04
Meh     just meh    not  bad not great very average   very expensive and service was not great  We were ignored for the most part and the guacamole was pretty bad   ,1,2017-12-06
Good food  good seasonal beer selection and great decor  Definitely bringing my Pup next time  they have special doggie treats and will bring your pup some cool water as well    ,4,2016-11-18

I love O H S O   Great atmosphere and of course the beer we ordered was awesome    mmm   IPA  great tasting O H S O  beer   All I have to say is that this will be  our  nd house    servers were very friendly and even the manager  Matt  came to our table  Love  love the beer  ,5,2015-12-05
Love that they are dog friendly  Food and drinks are great  Always have fun sitting on the patio ,5,2017-05-10
They definitely got this one right   nice job  Staff  food  surroundings   spot on  We had a great time ,5,2015-04-19
The brunch and the staff just cannot be beat  There is so much I could say about this place  But the pricing and options are great  It s certainly your neighborhood bar you love going back to over and over again ,5,2016-10-13
Fun place  Great selection  Good menu  Never had a bad experience here  Great vibes ambiance     Unique beer selection is good  Cheese dip is fantastic ,4,2017-01-27
Good beer selection and very cheap especially on Happy hour   PV needed a spot like this  Sure beats drinking at big fat greek   Bartender Kristin is half of reason I come in here  she is everything a bartender should be  fast and friendly    People like her make you want to return and it really makes a difference in the experience     stars for her   stars for the beers  skip the food  ,5,2015-05-11
I wanted to like this place  I really did  Some old coworkers and I wanted to meet for happy hour and they put me in charge of picking the restaurant  This place was so conveniently located and I had heard such good things about the other locations that we decided to give it a try  Our party of   arrived around     on Friday and found ourselves a comfy seat on a couch  The atmosphere was relaxed and awesome  Good music  nice ambience   That s about where it ended  Our waitress was friendly at first  I ordered The Camelback mixed drink and it was terrible  I appreciate when bartenders don t skimp on the liquor  but no exaggeration  it was undrinkable  I sent it back and asked for a pitcher of Papago instead  It s pretty hard to mess up beer  I put in for a order of their crab wontons and the sweet potato fries  The crab wontons were     cream cheese and the littlest bit of crab  Wouldn t recommend  And my beloved sweet potato fries  limp and mushy  I also ordered a side of IPA mustard for the fries  just  no  I will say that my friends loved the Jalape o Margarita they ordered  that seemed to be the only winner  Towards the end the waitress was pretty difficult to find and interactions were awkward  When we asked her to spilt the check  she told us to write whose order was whose and give it back to her when we were ready  I know it s annoying to ask for split checks  but have never had a server do that ,2,2015-05-04
So happy to have a hot spot in our backyard   Beer   food are amazaballs   Kathy the bartender   manger rocks    Will be back tomorrow     star brewery   Eatery     ,5,2015-03-15
Food is ok  Atmosphere is great  Bartenders extremely disinterested at best  We will never be back but if you go sit at a table the waiters are probably better than the bartenders   It is a huge bummer to spend a night out with bad service ,2,2018-01-07
Really good atmosphere  food was B   and service was excellent  This location is definitely more open and friendly then the ohso in Arcadia  The backyard luau was fun but the food was B grade   Tbh I enjoy the Arcadia backyard bbq more but overall I really enjoyed this place   Definitely will be back,4,2016-07-04
If you dined here this past Saturday night         check your bank account  Our bank account was hacked as was the couple we were with  Luckily our bank caught it and we were able to recover the fraudulent charges  Manager on site was called today and made aware  but didn t seem concerned  Not sure I will be going back if I can t trust the wait staff with my card ,2,2015-08-19
IF YOU DON T WANT TO DRINK BEER   COME HERE   This may or may not reflect on this location or the Indian School location but if you don t have   of your   beers available on tap then what are you doing in business      Also the service  even for an airport  blew more than the chucks blown by a    year old drunk for the first time  I think I ll just sit here and take up the space for an hour ,1,2017-03-15
Just had the absolute worst experience here  Went in and ordered   drinks a mimosa and a Bloody Mary at the back bar outdoors  First  the bartender was completely non responsive to us for about    minutes  perhaps not hip enough   then he finally waited on us  Ordered a     mimosa and     Bloody Mary  While my husband was signing the tab  and yes we did leave a good tip  my husband basically touched the top heavy Bloody Mary  The drink went over  Any good bartender  and yes I have children in the industry  would have given another drink at no charge  as yes there was customer contact  but the drink was way too top heavy   This guy looked totally annoyed at the accidental spill and said if you want another you pay for it  it wasn t my fault  I have been totally at fault for an accidental drink spill and received a replacement  Sorry to have an accidental spill and ruin your day  normal part of your profession and I d say this bartender better learn to handle it ,1,2018-03-04
I ve been here twice in the last month and my summary is that the place has great beer  but mediocre food and service   The staff is the typical young distracted unprofessional servers who get to you when they get to you  usually without a smile   The food is overpriced and not good at all ,3,2018-07-10
Want to hang out in your back yard  but lack fancyy chairs  games shade  good beer and the ability to cook   Don t fret OHSO has all of that and they will clean up when you are done   This was the prefect venue for an informal gathering to have some beer and a small snack  I really enjoyed their home made stout     You may want to wait for the temps to dip below     before seeking out the patio ,4,2015-06-17
The food was just okay  Sort of bland  However  I still give them   stars for having good service and great tasting beer  We will give them another try in the near future  hopefully the food is a bit better ,3,2018-01-22
Came to OHSO for the first time and it was excellent  Our waiter was Eric and he was great and knowledgeable with the menu   I m a mac n cheese connoisseur and I have to say  both macs are great here  I love the spice the crab Mac had    It s a cool place for all types of people  Great place for happy hour and get togethers  I will most likely be back  Thanks,5,2016-01-05
Hey OHSO  It s     degrees out and the monsoon is here  Please turn off the misters  close the doors  and turn on the A C next time I m there  Whew    maybe that s what the    beer was for    Pretty good beer and the chicken   waffles were great though ,4,2018-07-08
Wonderful experience  The sandwich I had featured an AMAZING cranberry sauce to complement the turkey and bun  The beer was amazing  as always  I had the popcycle blonde  and it was super refreshing on the     degree day  Our waiter switched halfway through our dining experience  which wasn t ideal  but everyone was super nice and accommodating ,5,2017-06-21
I m a huge fan of the OHSO Arcadia location  and a so so fan of the N  Scottsdale location   The PV location definitely ranks higher than N  Scottsdale  but isn t quite up to par with Arcadia     Pros   The place is huge   Lots of activities  and plenty of seating   There are also lots of misters and giant fans to help make the patio scene bearable in the summer heat   Service was great and very attentive  especially while seated on the patio waiting for our table   At other establishments  you usually have to fend for yourself at the bar for drinks while waiting to be seated   Nice job here  OHSO   Good food and  as always  lots of delicious beers to choose from as well       Cons   Well  there s really just one   There are kids everywhere   I hate to sound like I m anti children because I m not   I love kids  I just think there is a time and a place   Late afternoon early evening hours   Fine  I get it   Parents want to chill with friends after the workday and enjoy a bevie or two   But when it gets to be like   or      I m not here to tell people how to raise their kids or anything  but I just sometimes prefer to enjoy my evening beers on a patio without kids running around everywhere     So  given that the PV location s atmosphere is more family oriented  I think I ll be more likely to visit the others when I m in the mood for chill drinks in the evening with friends   N  Scottsdale when it s just drinks  the food is not good there   I don t know why they can t get it right  and Arcadia when I m looking for good eats to enjoy with cold ones ,4,2015-08-24
I love coming here  especially during the cooler months so we can enjoy the patio with our dog  The patio setup is so unique and fun  The brunch menu is amazing  They have the most creative foods  I love the fruity pebbles French toast  Whoever thought of that dish deserves a huge raise  I also love the Rosemary grilled chicken dish  Chicken can be such a boring meat but OHSO s Rosemary chicken is delicious  If you want a fun dog friendly bar and eatery I would highly recommend OHSO ,4,2016-07-24
We come to OHSo a lot  however  we mostly come because of their generous pet policy  Their food is above average but doesn t keep me up at night thinking about it  They have a decent variety of beer and spirits and it s a great place to hang out with the dogs during the nice weather ,4,2017-07-18
The atmosphere was great  Super cute and trendy  Our server probably checked on us almost every    minutes   Happy hour was fun because the food and beer was cheep  We had pretzel bites with jalape o cheese dip   So delicious  I would definitely go back  The overall service was good and it was a fun place to spend an afternoon  Would recommend ,4,2018-07-27
What a wonderful place   Such a great hangout with friends and family including the four legged ones    They have a bunch of games to play while you hangout and have a few of there great beers on tap or your favorite beverage  Make sure to say hi to Keith at the bar he s fantastic     As for the food OHSO has many choices from great starters I always get the hummus but the fries with steak is another of my favorites  And there main courses  salads  handhelds  burgers and sandwiches  tacos and the specials give you so many choices this is soon to become one of your go to places  I recommend the burgers you have a choice of a pink center or not pink center  I get the pink and it is always great the BBQ burger is my favorite  If you are going for a lighter meal the del sol salad is so amazing it comes with spicy seasoned chicken  avocado  corn  tomatoes  mixed greens  tortilla strips  and this amazing green dressing it s a must    If you haven t been here yet do try it and bring along mans best friend it will become their favorite place too  I know it is at the top of my babies favorite places to go  ,5,2015-04-30
The hot and cold water taps in the restroom are a creative touch and fits the theme  but a little unwieldy ,3,2015-03-15
Great environment  Our appetizer took a long time to get and when we got it the chips were very stale  Great beer and beer selection  Food was okay overall   but wouldn t come back just for the food ,3,2016-09-03
This place is just plain fun   The food is excellent  the beer is tasty and the staff is always friendly   My favorite entree is the   well everything  Great patio and game area  dog friendly  and family friendly ,5,2015-07-11
Wow  This place is not like the other   locations that I LOVE  Service is god awful     or should I say servers  food runners are friendly and efficient   On both occasions I have been here it was during non busy times and the servers took   mins to even greet us  I did see another server more on his game so I must have just  lucked  out both times  Hostesses were rude and unprofessional over the phone  wish I remembered her name    I love casual style dining but don t understand how non existent service is mistaken for the aforementioned  Love beer but sad the IPA from the other locations wasn t on yet but I believe it will be soon  Food was meh ,2,2015-03-20
Good beer and cheery atmosphere  Decisively cool inside in eating and bar area where it is basically open to the outside   Decisively cool despite the     degree day   Nice and friendly staff   Will come again   Did not eat here ,5,2016-07-23
Worst experience ever  Took my family who was in from out of town to the Paradise Valley location per some great recommendations and we had the worst experience ever   It was a Tuesday afternoon and we sat and waited for our appetizers for    minutes before our second waitress came by and asked  What did you order again   The restaurant was not busy and they only had one waitress apparently handling all of the tables inside and out   We then got a third waitress who just made the experience the worst ever   She was not happy to be working or serving us specifically   I asked her about the restaurant name and information on some shirts and she was like    I don t really know  What it stands for is on the wall    She had the most serious face ever and was not friendly at all   When it came time to actually order our food we had to flag down a bartender to get our waitress so we could order as she never made to back to our table after another    minutes   Our drinks had been empty for over    minutes and our appetizers were long gone   When she finally came we tried to get suggestions from her and she was visibly not on the mood to converse at all   When I started being indecisive with my side she was visibly frustrated with me and said   just pick one   She then went straight to who we later found out was the manager in training and talked trash about us and it was very evident they were both rolling their eyes   At that point  we got the attention of a manager honestly appeared to be on drugs and not equipped to handle the situation   He apologized and acknowledges that the waitress in fact did go to him to talk trash and he said   oh  I didn t know who she was talking about    Really   Instead of apologizing and diffusing the situation and focusing on how to make it right he literally just said he would change the wait staff yet again and the new waiter would be much better and more personable  The manager just said the waitresses conduct was not right and left   Our food came out   hours after we sat down   The manager then came by and said he would comp us the pint beer that was already on happy hour and put hummus board   We weren t looking for anything comp d just for her to be put in her place and reprimanded which did not appear to have occurred at all   Our food came out and was pretty tasty all around   Despite the terrible customer service  the food was good   Needless To say  I will not be returning to this location of OHSO if I ever return   I also shared this experience with the friends that referred us and they were embarrassed and shocked at how we were treated ,1,2019-06-28
Food was very bad    Like microwaved bar food    I got the pork wings and they were bone dry    Not moist or tender at all    Chips for chips and guacamole were stale      Tacos were pretty decent though   Gross  chilis has better food    However it s a fun scene for drinking  after work happy hour etc with the setup of their outside patio and bar area etc,2,2016-07-21
First time here and I love it  Great happy hour deals  So much more outdoor space compared to the Scottsdale location  Dog fountains  ping pong  corn hole and big tables for large parties  Friendly and quick service  In side bar has plenty of spaces to sit and TVs  Just got drinks this time  No milk alternatives for coffee ,5,2019-01-26
I was in a party of   tonight   They informed us what we had a    min wait since they do not do reservations for parties short of    people   We had to wait for an hour because the one table for   people were allowed to loiter for     mins after paying their bills   After some strong coaxing we had to squeeze into a table for   people   On a busy evening  with rain and limited seating as an excuse  we were told that they were not allowed to ask them to leave so we could have the table   Because of how terribly we were treated  we will have to think hard about coming back to OHSO   As a former server  I am severely disappointed with how we we re treated  ,2,2019-12-08
OHSO is simply the best  Don t try to find any other patio that is as dog friendly as OHSO because you won t be able to find it  We take our two Goldens with us at least four times a month  You can t beat good beer  good food and a good time with your fur babies  ALL locations of OHSO are awesome ,5,2019-03-15
Usually we have a great time at OHSO but tonight s experience rubbed me the wrong way  DO NOT order the Mac and cheese  We got the Mac and cheese from the kids menu because the only other option was the brisket Mac which vegetarians can t have  We were thinking we would get a smaller portion of the brisket Mac Mac and cheese  but we got boxed kraft style Mac and cheese instead  When we got our bill  we were charged     instead of the advertised        WHAT A WASTE  I think I m more irked by the fact that the server didn t say a thing about the price change or the fact that the Mac and cheese we were getting was boxed Mac and cheese stuff that would cost    at the store  We asked the server about the price difference and all he offered was a sorry  It s not like they added more Mac and cheese for the additional        Just the fact that we were adults    Also another star off for never having anything different on their menu  They do not have enough vegetarian friendly options  I usually love coming here  but after tonight  I ll be thinking twice  Service was subpar tonight  Wrong orders  missed items  slow refill on the waters  assuming we d pay on the same ticket    not big deal things  but it adds up ,2,2017-11-22
OMG this location is awesome  Service is so friendly  they are super dog friendly and we felt taken care of here  Ordered beers and salads    everything was super delicious  We love this place and will continue to come back ,5,2019-10-14
Only a few people at outside bar as i came in   shift change in process  Bartender said she would be right with me and i waited patiently   As bartender set up station   other bartender came and took my order  Asked if i wanted a pitcher  was thinking  no way  but pitchers were    oz  Whew   Anywhose  ended up getting a    ale   which was very good  Could even plug in my laptop at bar  even better   Did not try grub as i had just eaten  Pitcher was only   bones so that was super sweet  Will definitely be back   keep up the good brewing  Cheers ,4,2019-05-07
Changed my review to one star based on the hostess last night  Will never eat here again ,1,2018-09-15
I like O H S O  And I am surprised  I would not have thought to go here since I thought they only served beer  which I absolutely do not drink  A couple of our vendors for my company host happy hour for their Realtor clients  Therefore  I have been there twice  We always sit outside  Lots of playing of their outdoor games by the children and a lot of doggies around  There was a puppy party going on at one of the booths  Probably about five or six of them  I dunno  Is that sanitary   The servers are always friendly and efficient  HH includes pitchers of beer  wine  and cocktails  I either get the wine or cocktails  The appetizers  whether on the happy hour menu or not  are very tasty  veggies with I think some kind of dip or hummus  sweet potato fries  pita with hummus  What else do we order  A very typical HH  It s not bad ,3,2016-05-12
Finally a U of A bar in Phoenix   Great location   Good food  We had the pretzel board  The carne Assad tacos  The green chili pork  The surf and turf  And it was all very good   Great patio  We had   kids ranging from   weeks to   years and they all had a blast ,5,2015-05-10
Love love love this place  I was so excited to hear this place moving into the neighborhood and couldn t wait for them to open  The only downside is now I don t get the workout of riding my bicycle to the Indian School location  lol    If you re lucky enough to be there before they run out of the Red Rover  get it  Yummy beer  It s a great compliment to the salmon BLT burger  Also can t go wrong with their brunch  They do it right from the quiche to the burrito to the bloody mary and mimosa  Yummmmmmmmmmmmm ,4,2015-08-11
Won t be back to this location   Lines of what appeared to be open seats and  after being ignored by three girls at the hostess stand   I was the only one at the counter  was told it would be a       hour wait   Guess my money isn t green enough ,1,2016-03-26
Solid place for food  Dog friendly which is good  Kid friendly too  Staff is always very friendly    Food is good  Not exceptional  But good    A worthwhile spot to check out ,4,2018-10-19
My favorite dog friendly place  if you don t like dogs near while eating this may not be the place for you   The food is tasty  this time we shared the humus and the Jalapeno burger  Delicious   Service always on point,5,2016-08-16
I absolutely love hanging out with my friends and having some fresh beers at OHSO  The seating is nice and the games are fun  The food is tasty but I honestly struggle to find apps on the menu to please a group  I d recommend adding more so we can come by more often ,4,2016-12-24
Friendly staff   Ordered the brisket sandwhich and extra onion strings instead of fries  The onion strings were cooked earlier and tasted room temperature       I didn t eat them   The brisket appeared to be either a beef and sauce pre made item or they make a big batch and then hold it until it is served   The onion strings take a second so I don t know why they don t come out fresh and hot   Same with the brisket  Beef can be held and heated up with either steam or adding the sauce when heating  It tasted like it had been sitting all day s  and waiting for ME  Rather than me waiting for it fresh ,2,2018-11-17
Brisket sandwich   Brisket sandwich     Delicious   Guacamole  too   Go here   Eat   Drink  You will like   You re welcome ,5,2016-10-10
If you have a dog you gotta come here  Beautiful patio and the most dog friendly place we have been  The veggie burger is fantastic here  If you get there for happy hour you can get    pitchers of beer so that s s great deal  We bring out of town visitors here for brunch every time  can t go wrong here ,5,2017-08-05
I am so pleased to have  Primp and Blow so nearby for my convenience   It s like have my own personal hair designer available almost anytime I need one  I have been extremely happy each and every visit   Brigid knows exactly what customer service is all about ,5,2018-05-17
First time coming here with my daughter  Had a couple of    pitchers of there orange blossom beer very good    Overall great service  at the time they had a party of    walk in and with only   servers they did Awesome    Will definitely be back again    ,4,2016-02-16
Best chicken and waffles I ve ever had  in my life    This was our first visit to OHSO  I d like to thank Sam for the great recommendations ,5,2018-09-30
Chicken n Waffles  best in the Phoenix area  The place is such a fun environment and the staff was very nice  Food was cooked just right and tasted amazing  I was a little worried the Chicken n Waffles wouldn t compare to Hash House  but they were a great contender  So if you have that craving for Chicken n Waffles and don t have time to go to Vegas  these won t disappoint at all  Your craving will be satisfied and you don t have to drive to Vegas   The appetizers were also really delicious  Way to go OHSO  ,5,2017-06-27
I love OHSO  My family and I go all the time and it s by far one of my favorite restaurants  It s a great dog friendly environment and they even have treats at the door for your pup  The food here is also incredible  I ve never had something that didn t taste totally awesome   My only complaint is most the time I end up getting mediocre service  The servers seem like they re almost ALWAYS having a bad day or they d rather be somewhere else  This happens I want to say   times out of     The restaurant can also be very loud during busy times of week dinner  weekends  holidays etc   If you re willing to put this aside  I highly recommend this place ,4,2016-05-02
It s a very unique place  Wasn t to fond at first with seeing all the dogs going in there but we were not close to sitting next to them  I have allergies with their hair so being next to some would be unpleasant for me  I would give it a   only if there was a different are where the dogs can stay and not so close to other people  The food was delicious tho  ,4,2016-05-12
We had a very pleasant visit here for a Monday lunch  It was a hot July day  but we sat on the massive patio  which was kept cool and comfortable with fans  misters  and shade  the only downside was the background noise of the fans    The crowds were light and our service was excellent  My husband had a beer from on tap while I had the lemon meringue  which was rather like a not too sweet lemonade  Plus  with happy hour pricing  it was just      Our food came out pretty fast  Our son ordered the kid s meal macaroni and cheese with fries  It looked like Kraft mac to me  but hey  no complaints  He was happy  My husband ordered the beer braised beef short ribs  which had a lovely presentation  see the pic  and were delicious  too  I had a bite of the short ribs  The meat was tender and flaky  and the gravy was the perfect complement   I had the kale and pear salad  and paid extra to add ahi  The flavors did clash slightly because the ahi turned out to have a rather potent pepper crust  but it ended up okay once I started using the citrus sweet salad to cool down my mouth after each bite of fish  Everything was fresh and tasty  The candied walnuts added a lovely crunch  and unlike some places  they did not skimp on cheese   Hooray for abundant cheese     We had been to the Scottsdale OHSO a few years ago and have always wanted to go back or try another location  This visit to their Paradise Valley restaurant reaffirmed that they have great food and are well stopping in again ,5,2018-07-17
Soooo awesome  As a visitor from Hawaii I was amazed how cool this place was   literally  Plenty of misters and shade to keep us cool  The food was BOMB COM  Group of   adults and   small kids  We ordered chicken   waffles  monte cristo  and breakfast bowl  Kids meal was literally mac n cheese from kraft box  which is honestly perfect  It s what kids want  The chicken   waffles was the clear favorite of the table  but everything was delicious  BEST part about this place  It was not only dog friendly but dog WELCOMING  They had the cutest water trough made with beer taps  And plenty of games too throughout the courtyard and tvs for sports games  MAN I wish we had something like this in Hawaii   ,5,2017-09-20
Only okay   My girlfriend arrived    minutes before me with her pup  They got one of the lounge style tables in the middle of the patio  Unfortunately  all of the large outdoor booths were occupied just   hour after opening    After I arrived it took the server about   minutes to come by  Which I understand  It takes a bit of time  no problem  When she came by we ordered two pints and she let us know getting a pitcher would be a better deal  Beer is good no complaints there    We both order different burgers  They were fine  Mine was over cooked  medium instead of medium rare and severely under seasoned  While the sweet potato fries were yummy  how could they not be  They were incredibly over seasoned with iodized salt  Really  Use kosher or sea salt please    The real grip though  a SWEET white bun  Why on earth would you put a burger on a sweet bun  Don t mess with my beefy bacon and cheese goodness with oddly sweet bun that gets chewy  like raw dough  as the juices soak in     Ugghh      As we were leaving there were probably     staff behind the outdoor host stand  And this made me ask myself   why was my water glass empty   In fact  both of our water glasses and beer glasses were empty so why were we never offered another drink  I shouldn t have to ask for a water refill it should be automatic    There were a lot of kids like other have stated there are a lot of kids  This is to be expected  it s a restaurant not a night club     They were well behaved and attended to    All in all it was only okay  I will go back and also try the other locations  Hopefully the next visit is better ,3,2015-04-23
Consistently great food and drink with a comfortable neighborhood feeling  I prefer this location to the original Arcadia spot because it s usually not quite as busy and has a more relaxed crowd  I love being able to do small pours to create custom flights and appreciate their weekend brunch deal  Yum ,5,2017-01-28
I loved this brewery  meeting up with a girlfriend for dinner while she was in town   I still dream about the tacos  This was awhile ago  I swore they were al pastor  but I don t see them on the menu   perhaps it was the short rib tacos    regardless   I cannot wait to go back when my boyfriends parents visit this summer   Environment  service  food was great ,5,2018-07-26
OHSO has stepped up their beer brunch  Their take on a Monte Cristo served with delicious potatoes was fantastic  Monte Cristo     oz OHSO Pumpkin Porter for     ,4,2015-11-16
Some of the food items are good  burgers  but the tacos are terrible   outdoor seating with TVs  cornhole games and dog friendly are a bonus   extensive bar is also a plus   I d give them   stars if I didn t have to throw the tacos in the trash,3,2016-12-01
The outside seating area was great which attracted us here   Food was average  nothing to go crazy over   Drinks were a bit overpriced for the size and amount of alcohol too   It was  meh  ,3,2018-06-11
I love the atmosphere and the staff was very pleasant   The place is mostly clean  properly lit  and inviting   They have a VERY nice beer selection  booze selection and mixed drinks   That alone can make the evening   The food was a little underwhelming for me   The burgers were pretty good  patties are very good  but I am not a fan of the sweet bread used to hold them   The fries were probably the best part of the meal   They are made exactly the way I like them   firmly crisp with a soft interior  nice flavor  doesn t need catchup   The salad was pretty good  not great  and I would not complain about it     So  while the food did not excite me  the reason for showing in a place like this one is for the atmosphere  good beers  and nice staff ,4,2016-02-17
Brought my family here to celebrate my birthday as I wanted to do something a little different  Usually we go to True Foods for all of our family birthdays but I figured I d give this place a try since I heard good things  We sat outside  which was a big mistake  They had a one man live band playing that was just God awful and it reached a point where we couldn t take it anymore and left    When my mom made the reservation that said she could bring my cake and that they d refrigerate it for her  Well  when she brought it  they didn t put it in the fridge so my birthday cake was ruined    The food was decent  I had the veggie burger which was good  The bread was a little doughy but overall it had a good flavor  We also ordered guacamole  which was really good    They have a rather large patio with ping pong and bean bags  which looks like a lot of fun  I wanted to stay and play but it seemed like there was a long wait to play the games and the band was terrible  I don t think I can listen to the Beatles anymore after the guy butchered Let It Be   I m willing to give this place another try even though they pretty much ruined my birthday  I felt bad for my mom because she worked so hard baking my cake ,2,2015-10-26
The food is decent  The beer is decent  The service is great  And the ambiance is neat   I have had a few of their hamburgers  They are always cooked to order and fresh  Breakfast here is good too  Their guest tapped beers are better then their own  Try the Dragoon IPA  The service staff is fast and efficient  There are plenty of people working here and all are ready to help   The outside area is fun although it can get a little dusty from the games  It is very relaxed and a great place to hang out with friends  However  I do not appreciate animals being welcome in an eating drinking establishment ,4,2017-02-02
This place has Mr  Pineapple on tap and you can buy growlers  Pretty pricey  but the beer is hard to find and tastes like garbage in a can    Yet to eat at this place  but if it s anything like the Scottsdale location  I am not in a hurry to blow     on mediocre food ,3,2016-11-01
Great place  great location and good food   They need to work on the appertizers and I would love for them to bring back the flatbreat pizzas they had at the original Arcadia location ,4,2015-05-11
Although the dog bike friendly community is attractive to many this is why I give   stars     Dog hairs on my dining table  glass of water  and clothes     I ordered brisket mac and I expected softer meat  but was actually hard to chew      Our waiter kept petting a dog on way to serve us our food  Dog licked hands and food is a no no     Overall food is mediocre and little overpriced for its quality    Concept of live music is nice  but come here if you want to scream your conversation    Maybe nice to watch a game with beer and friends  Wouldn t come again though ,2,2016-12-05
Great service   Stop in for lunch and a couple pints on happy hour  Friendly staff and good environment ,5,2015-07-02
Best burger in town  I had the burger and cheese  It comes with bacon  gouda cheese  Ohso sauce  lettuce    tomato  The meat was fresh and delicious  The homemade bun was soft and tasty  When I want a delicious burger  I go to Ohsos   Worth the price and you will not ever be disappointed,5,2017-06-04
When a large space  especially a large space with a massive patio  opens only a few days before you go  even if it s the  rd location  I m generally willing to forgive quite a bit  At OHSO  we had to forgive very little  To set the stage  we sat a table of   indoors right after   pm at the end of Happy Hour  I ll get the things we had to forgive out of the way first   CONS      Our table of   ordered   pints  waited until the waitress came back  ordered   happy hour appetizers  and then the appetizers came first  Not a big issue  but a bit weird     It s tough to get a seat outside  and it seems that they may be underestimating how long a table takes  With the dog and kid friendly atmosphere complete with cornhole  a small dog park  and lots of families taking advantage of the amenities  it makes sense that it s hard to give up a spot     Service is  overall  a bit sporadic  There s not a consistent route among tables yet  so you may see your server   times in    minutes and then not again for another     Unless you re in a hurry  you won t mind nor notice   Now that those are out of the way  I ll get to all of the things that were impressive about this newly opened brewhouse   PROS      Prices are unbelievable   especially the happy hour prices  It  would be hard to complain about the normal prices  but the beers you can get for      oz pitcher are great and the small bites you get for    a pop are excellent     Food comes out hot  if it s supposed to  and promptly considering the crowd  If it s supposed to be spicy  it s really  wonderfully spicy and the portions are consistently generous for the price  There s lots to try  but the varied sampling we ordered convinced me to try as much as  possible     The menu has several things for everyone  and everything we had  from all parts of the menu  was wonderful  Aside from the numerous food choices  the bar menu is much better than most  There is a full list of AZ beers  other wonderful beers from around the country  some of the tastier mass market wines  and some great liquors in case you re looking for something harder  For ostensibly being a brewery   craft beer bar  there s a ton to offer here  Considering how close my wife s parents live to this OHSO location  we will be back many  many times  It s a great spot for the whole family  especially if a few folks in the family are interested in trying AZ beers that you won t likely see anywhere else in the immediate area   SCORING      Value          Taste          Menu          Service          OVERALL     ,4,2015-03-20
Not only was this place poorly managed but the food and menu was a disaster       and our food was nothing special      a burger and it was the most disgusting thing I have tasted in all my life  The only highlight from that place was the French fry monument I left in honor for how truly atrocious it was ,2,2017-04-29
Happy hour at this location was a hit   casual laid back vibe   people getting out of work  people with dogs grabbing dinner with friends    I sat next to a guy needed to kill an hour before heading to the airport     My friend and I shared the pretzel   cheese and Thai hummus    from the happy hour menu both had good flavor    perfect bar food    we also had the chips   guac and added the roasted salsa    yep we were stuffed     I also had The Mule and the Peach Smash with peach whiskey    yum that was refreshing   I d highly recommend the Peach Smash if you like whiskey   Plenty of parking     lots of seating options inside  bar area and huge patio area with misters    it s a dog   kid friendly kind of place   We ll be back for happy hour and brunch soon ,4,2018-09-08
Very hip  fun and delicious spot in the heart of Phoenix  We stopped here on our way to Grand Canyon which was nice because we got some fun and great advices from the locals    I thought the atmosphere was exciting and unique  The outdoor spot was lovely and specious and dogs are allowed  which is always a plus  We grabbed breakfast out on a patio and got penny beer  A penny beer is   cent beer with a meal from brunch Manu  The food was great  simple  fresh and fun  I got salsa bowl with scrambled eggs and cheese  The food tasted very fresh and not too heavy  My friend got fruity Fresh Toast  it was super dope and very delicious  Over all our experience was nice and welcoming ,5,2018-10-12
We have been loyal patrons to this location for years   Today we were here for a party  on the patio having to order drinks from the outside bar   One of the bartenders  with a man bun  was visably annoyed at having to serve anyone standing at the bar  It was almost like we were inconveniencing him to place our order  We love this place  so this one incidence will not hinder or patronage but it was disappointing to be treated this way ,1,2019-03-24
Food  service  beverage  prices are great  But credit card machine down again  Supposedly its an issue that occurs frequently  They wrote our CC   down on piece of paper with a carbon   So not appropriate    They should comp our drinks   Bring cash or do not go  May not return ,2,2019-05-30
At first when we checked in at the hostess stand  we weren t impressed with their customer service  We were standing there for about   minute without an acknowledgement  eye contact or a smile  I am in the customer service industry and this was huge turn off for me  Even if you re busy  you should greet all your customers with a smile or let them know you will be with them in just a moment  Especially when there was   girls at the stand    Once we were seated  our waitress was fantastic  Food and beer was great ,4,2019-04-21
This new location improved upon an already great setup  They have a fantastic happy hour   killer patio area  The ambiance is on point and the atmosphere is the perfect place to grab a pitcher of beer  a yummy bite  and play some cornhole or foosball with some friends   Bonus points  they even offer doggie treats to take home that they make with the spent grain from brewing ,5,2015-08-07
I came into OHSO for an early lunch and was warmly greeted by Sydney at the bar  She answered a couple of questions I had and brought me a sample of one of their wonderful ales  As the afternoon went on the bar became more and more crowded  She took drink orders from the bar and servers  answered a plethora of questions and it seemed as if she was the  go to person  on this particular day  Even as crowded as it was  she was attentive to each customer and I heard nothing but great comments about her  This bartender is a keeper and I hope that the OHSO management realizes what a gem she is  By the way  the pretzel and cheese dip that I got was a great pairing with the Boom Dynamite IPA ,5,2019-06-15
My sisters and I walked up to the hostess who proceeded to give us a thorough look up and down before sitting us  We sat for fifteen minutes and not one person greeted us or offered water  even though we saw servers walking around  We left without ordering anything ,1,2019-04-19
We had an amazing experience this past weekend at OHSO  Katie  our server was amazing  She was friendly and I thought it was really cool she took the time to introduce us to other staff  The Moscow muke was fantastic and the new spritzer drink was really refreshing  The outside patio was a beautiful setting  Katie really made our experience top notch  Next time the dog comes with for sure  We did take home treats ,5,2019-05-29
Went out for a girls night  The atmosphere is perfect and the service was great  Sitting outdoors on the patio was perfect  you get to see all of the adorable dogs  I ordered the pb j burger and it was delicious  My friends order some appetizers and tacos  Even though my burger was great they mentioned their food wasn t quite worth the price  Great beer selection  grab a glass of Big Blue Van  it s delicious ,4,2019-07-28
This place is awesome  I get the same thing everytime  Steak n Fries is outta this world ,5,2018-08-16
Been to this location a few times and believe it serves the best food of all the locations  Can t beat the brunch specials that include a pint or large glass mimosa  Ordered the breakfast tacos and they are excellent  but don t be fooled  These are plenty filled so bring an appetite or share with a partner ,4,2019-09-01
Atmosphere is number one in this restaurant  Dog freindly  Kid freindly  Staff and servers are freindly and caring  Great time to relax with freinds  Menu items are excellent  Some appetizers great and some need to be left off on the menu   ,5,2019-08-18
This wold be a better review  however I have been to   OHSO locations now  and have had to wait almost    minutes to be greeted   THe first timeI walked out   I was about to walk out this time  but was greeted just in time  After that  the food is very good  the serivce was good  but a but dsorganized   I woudl eat here again ,4,2015-06-21
